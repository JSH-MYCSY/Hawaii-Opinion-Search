OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, PRESIDING J.
 
This consolidated appeal arises out of an arbitration
 
of an employer-employee labor dispute over holiday pay and
 
benefits.
 
In appeal No. 30116, Employer County of Hawaii (County
 
or Employer) appeals from the Judgment (Judgment) filed on
 
September 16, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 
(First Circuit Court). The First Circuit Court entered judgment
 in favor of Union United Public Workers, AFSCME, Local 646, AFL­
CIO (UPW or Employee) and against County pursuant to the "Order
 
Granting Union's Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award Dated
 
July 9, 2009 as Modified on July 29, 2009," filed September 16,
 
2009.
 
On appeal, County contends the First Circuit Court
 
erred when it 
(1) found the First Circuit Court, rather than the
 
Circuit Court of the Third Circuit (Third Circuit Court), to be
 
the proper venue to hear UPW's July 17, 2009 "Motion to Confirm
 
and to Modify and Correct Award by Arbitrator Michael Marr Dated
 
July 9, 2009" (Motion to Confirm);
 
(2) confirmed the Final Arbitration Award (Arbitration
 
Award) because the award violated public policy under Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 89-9(d)(7) (Supp. 2003); and
 
(3) confirmed the Arbitration Award because Arbitrator
 
Michael Marr (the Arbitrator) exceeded his authority by ruling on
 
the issue of collateral estoppel.
 
In appeal No. 30421, UPW appeals from the First Circuit
 
Court's March 22, 2010 post-judgment "Order Granting Employer
 
County of Hawaii's Motion to Stay Enforcement of Judgment Pending
 
Appeal Filed on January 7, 2010" (Order Granting Motion to Stay).
 
UPW contends that

(1) in a case involving or growing out of a labor
 
dispute, a court lacks jurisdiction to stay enforcement of an
 
arbitral award;
 
(2) under HRS § 380-4(3) (1993), a court lacks
 
jurisdiction to withhold monetary payments to persons involved in
 
a labor dispute;
 
(3) before a court has jurisdiction to issue an
 
injunctive order under HRS Chapter 380, the court must meet
 
certain procedural requirements; and
 
(4) judicial relief is unavailable under HRS § 380-8

I.
 
A. ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS
 
UPW is the collective bargaining representative for
 
collective bargaining Unit 1 employees (Unit 1 employees). The
 
July 1, 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) for Unit 1
 
employees requires the parties to resolve contract disputes via a
 
grievance process culminating in arbitration of unresolved
 
disputes. On August 22, 2003, UPW filed a class grievance on
 
behalf of Unit 1 employees, alleging that County failed to pay
 
holiday pay and benefits to employees who were on leaves of
 
absence without pay. County denied the grievance, UPW submitted
 
the case to arbitration, and the parties mutually selected the
 
Arbitrator. 
On March 24, 2008, UPW filed a Motion for Summary
 
Disposition. The Arbitrator heard the motion on July 18, 2008
 
and on August 12, 2008 issued an "Order Granting in Part and
 
Denying in Part [UPW's] Motion for Summary Disposition Filed on
 
March 24, 2008," as corrected by order dated August 13, 2008. On
 
January 30, 2009, the Arbitrator heard UPW's two motions: one
 
for discovery sanctions, attorney's fees, and costs of discovery
 
and one for a final arbitration award, back pay with interest, a
 
cease and desist order, and attorney's fees. On June 1, 2009,
 
the Arbitrator held a hearing on the parties' positions regarding
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
holiday pay for certain classes of employees. On July 9, 2009,
 
the Arbitrator issued the Arbitration Award in favor of UPW and
 
against County.
 
B. FIRST CIRCUIT COURT AND APPELLATE PROCEEDINGS
 
UPW filed the Motion to Confirm the Arbitration Award
 
on July 17, 2009. On September 16, 2009, pursuant to the "Order
 
Granting Union's Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award Dated
 
July 9, 2009 as Modified on July 29, 2009," the First Circuit
 
Court filed the Judgment, entering judgment in favor of UPW and
 
against County. County filed a notice of appeal from the
 
Judgment on October 12, 2009. County's appeal was docketed as
 
No. 30116. On December 28, 2009, UPW filed a motion to dismiss
 
the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, which motion this
 
court denied on March 15, 2010.
 
On January 7, 2010, County filed a post-judgment
 
"Motion to Stay Enforcement of Judgment Pending Appeal" (Motion
 
to Stay). On March 22, 2010, the First Circuit Court entered the
 
Order Granting Motion to Stay. UPW filed a notice of appeal on
 
April 5, 2010 from the Order Granting Motion to Stay. UPW's
 
appeal was docketed as No. 30421.
 
This court filed an Order of Consolidation on
 
December 23, 2010, consolidating appeal Nos. 30116 and 30421
 
under No. 30116 for disposition.
 
II.
 
A. ARBITRATION AWARD
 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's ruling 
on an arbitration award de novo" and is also "mindful that the 
circuit court's review of arbitral awards must be extremely 
narrow and exceedingly deferential." Tatibouet v. Ellsworth, 99 
Hawai'i 226, 233, 54 P.3d 397, 404 (2002) (internal quotation 
marks, citation, and brackets omitted). 
The appellate court's review of arbitration awards is
 
guided by the following principles:
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
It is well settled that because of the legislative policy to
encourage arbitration and thereby discourage litigation,
judicial review of an arbitration award is confined to the
strictest possible limits. As such, a court has no business
weighing the merits of the arbitration award. Indeed, the
legislature has mandated that a court may vacate an
arbitration award only on the four grounds specified in HRS
§ 658-9,
[2] and may modify or correct an award only on the
three grounds specified in HRS § 658-10. Therefore, HRS
§ 658-8 contemplates a judicial confirmation of the award
issued by the arbitrator, unless the award is vacated,
modified, or corrected in accord with HRS §§ 658-9 and
658-10.
 
Based upon the policy limiting judicial review of
arbitration awards, [the Hawai' i Supreme Court] has held
that parties who arbitrate a dispute assume all the hazardsof the arbitration process including the risk that thearbitrators may make mistakes in the application of law andin their findings of fact. Where arbitration is made in good faith, parties are not permitted to prove that anarbitrator[] erred as to the law or the facts of the case. 
Id. (internal quotation marks, citations, ellipses, and brackets 
in original omitted) (quoting Wayland Lum Constr., Inc. v. 
Kaneshige, 90 Hawai' i 417, 421, 978 P.2d 855, 859 (1999)). 
B. SCOPE OF ARBITRATOR'S AUTHORITY
 
"The scope of an arbitrator's authority is determined 
by agreement of the parties. An arbitrator must act within the 
scope of the authority conferred upon him by the parties and 
cannot exceed his power by deciding matters not submitted." 
Clawson v. Habilitat, Inc., 71 Haw. 76, 78, 783 P.2d 1230, 1231 
(1989). "[W]here an arbitrator has exceeded his or her powers by 
deciding matters not submitted, [the Hawai' i Supreme Court] has 
held, pursuant to HRS § 658-9(4),[3] that the resulting 
arbitration award must be vacated." Tatibouet, 99 Hawai' i at 
235, 54 P.3d at 406. 
When the parties include an arbitration clause in their
collective bargaining agreement, they choose to have
disputes concerning constructions of the contract resolved
 
2
 HRS Chapter 658 was repealed in 2001 when the Hawai' i Legislature
adopted Chapter 658A, based on the Uniform Arbitration Act. 2001 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 265, § 1 at 810 & § 5 at 820. The former § 658-9 (Vacating Award) isnow § 658A-23, § 658-8 (Award and Confirming Award) was split into § 658A-19and § 658A-22, and § 658-10 (Modifying or Correcting Award) is now § 658A-24.

by an arbitrator. Unless the arbitral decision does not
 
draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, a
court is bound to enforce the award and is not entitled to
 review the merits of the contract dispute. This remains so
 even when the basis for the arbitrator's decision may be
ambiguous.
 
W.R. Grace & Co. v. Local Union 759, Int'l Union of United
 
Rubber, Cork, Linoleum & Plastic Workers of Am., 461 U.S. 757,
 
764, 103 S. Ct. 2177, 2182 (1983) (internal quotation marks, 
citations, and brackets omitted).
 
Because the authority of arbitrators is a subject of
collective bargaining, just as is any other contractual
provision, the scope of the arbitrator's authority is itself
a question of contract interpretation that the parties have
delegated to the arbitrator. [The second Arbitrator's]
conclusions that [the first Arbitrator] acted outside his
jurisdiction and that this deprived [the first Arbitrator's]
award of precedential force under the contract draw their
"essence" from the provisions of the collective bargaining
agreement. Regardless of what our view might be of the
correctness of [the second Arbitrator's] contractual
interpretation, the Company and the Union bargained for that
interpretation. A federal court may not second-guess it.
 
Id. at 765, 103 S. Ct. at 2183.
 
C. PUBLIC POLICY
 
A court may not enforce any contract "that is contrary
 
to public policy." Id. at 766, 103 S. Ct. at 2183. It follows
 
that "[i]f the contract as interpreted [by an arbitrator]
 
violates some explicit public policy, [the courts] are obliged to
 
refrain from enforcing it." Id. Thus, the United States Supreme
 
Court has recognized a public policy exception to the general
 deference given arbitration awards. United Paperworkers Int'l
 
Union, AFL-CIO v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 42-43, 108 S. Ct.
 364, 373-74 (1987) (to refuse to enforce an arbitration award,
 
the alleged violation of public policy must be clearly shown). 
[T]he public policy exception requires a court to determine
that (1) the award would violate some explicit public policy
that is well defined and dominant, and that is ascertained
by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from
general considerations of supposed public interests, and (2)
the violation of the public policy is clearly shown. Hence,
a refusal to enforce an arbitration award must rest on more
 than speculation or assumption.

E. STATUTORY INTERPRETATION
 
"Questions of statutory interpretation are questions
of law reviewable de novo." Gump v. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc.,
93 Hawai' i 417, 420, 5 P.3d 407, 410 (2000). In our review 
of questions of statutory interpretation, this court follows
certain well-established principles, as follows: 
First, the fundamental starting point for
statutory interpretation is the language of the
statute itself. Second, where the statutory language
is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give
effect to its plain and obvious meaning. Third,
implicit in the task of statutory construction is our
foremost obligation to ascertain and give effect to
the intention of the legislature, which is to be
obtained primarily from the language contained in the
statute itself. Fourth, when there is doubt,
doubleness of meaning, or indistinctiveness or
uncertainty of an expression used in a statute, an
ambiguity exists. And fifth, in construing an
ambiguous statute, the meaning of the ambiguous words
may be sought by examining the context, with which the
ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be
compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.

A.	 THE FIRST CIRCUIT COURT  DID NOT ERR WHEN IT FOUND
THAT IT WAS THE PROPER VENUE FOR THE PROCEEDING TO
 
CONFIRM THE ARBITRATION AWARD.
 
County contends that pursuant to HRS § 658A-27 (Supp.
 
5	 the Third Circuit Court,6
2010),  not the First Circuit Court,
was the proper venue for the court proceeding to confirm the
 
Arbitration Award. County argues that the CBA is silent on where
 
an arbitration hearing should be held, County arbitration
 
hearings on the merits are always held within the third judicial
 
circuit, and County would never have consented to move an
 
evidentiary hearing outside the third judicial circuit because
 
most of the witnesses lived in that circuit.
 
County also contends that an arbitration hearing on the
 
merits was never held and, therefore, under HRS § 658A-27, the
 
proper venue was "any circuit in which an adverse party resides
 
or has a place of business." County reasons that because it was
 
the adverse party with its place of business in the third
 
judicial circuit, the Third Circuit Court was the proper venue. 
Lastly, County claims the First Circuit Court had previously

 HRS § 658A-27 provides:
 
HRS §658A-27 Venue.  A motion pursuant to section 658A-5
shall be made in the court of the circuit in which the agreement
to arbitrate specifies the arbitration hearing is to be held or,
if the hearing has been held, in the court of the circuit in which
it was held. Otherwise, the motion may be made in the court of
any circuit in which an adverse party resides or has a place of
business or, if no adverse party has a residence or place of
business in this State, in the court of any circuit in this State.
All subsequent motions shall be made in the court hearing the
initial motion unless the court otherwise directs.

8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ruled that the Third Circuit Court was the proper venue to hear
 
this case.
 
Section 15.18c of the CBA provides that "[t]he date,
 
time and place of the hearing fixed by the Arbitrator shall be
 
within twenty (20) calendar days from the selection of the
 
Arbitrator." In its opening brief, County concedes that the
 
Arbitrator has the authority to fix the date, time, and place of
 
the hearing. Therefore, County's contention that the CBA was
 
silent on where the arbitration hearing should be held is without
 
merit.
 
County next argues that only pre-arbitration hearings
 
were held, no arbitration hearing on the merits was conducted,
 
and, thus, there was no arbitration.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 658A-27, when an arbitration hearing
 
has been held, any application for judicial relief is made in the
 
court where the arbitration hearing was held; "[o]therwise, the
 
motion may be made in the court of any circuit in which an
 
adverse party resides or has a place of business."
 
Under well-established rules of statutory construction,
 
where there is no ambiguity in the language of a
statute, and the literal application of the language
would not produce an absurd or unjust result, clearly
inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the
statute, there is no room for judicial construction
and interpretation, and the statute must be given
effect according to its plain and obvious meaning.

County reasons that because there was no evidentiary
 
hearing on the merits, there was no arbitration. County cites to
 
no authority for the proposition that an arbitration hearing only
 
occurs when there is a hearing on the merits.

119 (9th ed. 2009). The CBA provided that the arbitrator
 
determines the issues to be resolved and conducts the hearing. 
CBA 15.18b & c. In the instant case, the parties mutually
 
selected the Arbitrator. Following a telephone conference on
 
November 26, 2007 with the parties, the Arbitrator faxed a letter
 
to the parties identifying the agreements and stipulations made
 
during the telephone conference. According to the letter, UPW
 
agreed to file its motion for summary disposition on the finality
 
7 8
of the 2003 Parnell and 2007 Ikeda  awards on the issue of
holiday pay by March 31, 200[8], and County agreed to file its
 
memorandum in opposition to UPW's motion for summary disposition
 
no later than April 30, 2008.
 
County was aware from the beginning of arbitration that
 
the first, and perhaps only, issue to be arbitrated was whether
 
County was estopped from arguing on the merits regarding holiday
 
pay. 
County did not object on the basis of arbitrability or on
 
any other basis, participated in two more telephone conferences,
 and submitted an opposition memorandum on the issue of collateral
 
estoppel.
 
The Arbitrator set the hearing regarding UPW's motion
 
for summary disposition for May 28, 2008 at the UPW Union Hall
 
(UPW Hall) in Honolulu. On May 8, 2008, County asked for a
 
continuance on the motion and, on May 30, 2008, confirmed a new
 
date of July 18, 2008 for the hearing on UPW's motion.
 
The motion for summary disposition came on for hearing
 
on July 18, 2008 at the UPW Hall with both parties and the

conducted a hearing via teleconference regarding a final
 
arbitration award and motions for discovery sanctions. On
 
June 1, 2009, the Arbitrator held a third hearing via telephone
 
conference with UPW and County on holiday pay for certain classes
 
of employees. Based on the hearings of January 30, 2009 and
 
June 1, 2009, the Arbitrator issued the Arbitration Award on
 
July 9, 2009.
 
UPW then filed the Motion to Confirm in the First
 
Circuit Court. It was only at this point County contended, in
 
its opposition memorandum to the motion, that because the merits
 
had not been addressed, arbitration had not been held.
 
The facts indicate the Arbitrator fixed the place of
 
the hearing, the arbitration was held in Honolulu over the course
 
of three dates, County participated in person and by telephone,
 
and, in the end, the Arbitration Award was issued based on the
 
arbitration hearing.
 
County further argues that the First Circuit Court had
 
previously ruled that the Third Circuit Court was the proper
 
venue to hear this case. County misstates the First Circuit
 
Court's ruling.
 
On December 22, 2008, the First Circuit Court (Judge
 
McKenna presiding) heard a motion by UPW to consolidate another
 
holiday pay arbitration case, Special Proceeding No. 08-1-0432
 
(SP No. 08-1-0432), with the instant case. The First Circuit
 
Court determined that venue in the first circuit for the motion
 
was improper because UPW was not the adverse party and ordered
 
the case transferred to the Third Circuit Court. Notwithstanding
 
that order, on January 13, 2009, in the First Circuit Court, the
 
parties filed a stipulation to dismiss SP No. 08-1-0432 without
 
prejudice.
 
On August 17, 2009, Judge McKenna heard UPW's Motion to
 
Confirm. Judge McKenna stated that if SP No. 08-1-0432 were
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
still pending in the Third Circuit Court, then the Motion to
 
Confirm would have been properly heard in the Third Circuit
 
Court. However, since SP No. 08-1-0432 had been dismissed, the
 
Motion to Confirm had been filed in a new and separate action. 
The judge determined that the instant arbitration was properly
 
held in Honolulu, where the Arbitrator was located. Judge
 
McKenna likened arbitration hearings to court proceedings, where
 
the location of the proceeding is considered to be wherever the
 
fact finder is, even if witnesses or parties participate via
 
telephone or video conference from another location.
 
We conclude the First Circuit Court did not err in
 
finding that the it was the proper venue to hear the Motion to
 
Confirm.
 
B.	 THE FIRST CIRCUIT COURT DID NOT ERR IN CONFIRMING
 
THE ARBITRATION AWARD WHEN IT FOUND THE AWARD DID
 NOT VIOLATE PUBLIC POLICY AND THE ARBITRATOR DID
 NOT EXCEED HIS SCOPE OF AUTHORITY.
 
Whether the First Circuit Court erred in confirming the 
Arbitration Award is a question of law reviewable de novo. 
Tatibouet, 99 Hawai' i at 233, 54 P.3d at 404. In this court's 
review of the First Circuit Court's ruling, we are cognizant of the extreme deference the First Circuit Court must give to its 
review of the arbitration award. Id. 
County contends the Arbitration Award violated public
 
policy by denying County's fundamental constitutional right to
 
due process, improperly applying collateral estoppel to the 2003
 
Parnell Award in contravention of the CBA grievance process as
 
outlined in CBA Section 15, and materially altering the CBA in
 
disregard of employees' rights under HRS Chapter 89.
 
Under the fifth amendment of the United States 
Constitution and article 1, section 5 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution, a person shall not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Procedural due process 
requires a party be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.

Sandy Beach Defense Fund v. City Council of City & County of
 
Honolulu, 70 Haw. 361, 378, 773 P.2d 250, 261 (1989). County
 
argues that because it was not a party to the 2003 Parnell Award,
 
the application of collateral estoppel denied County its right to
 
procedural due process.
 
Collateral estoppel prevents the relitigation of a fact
 
or issue that was determined in a prior case between the same
 
parties or their privies on a different cause of action. Bremer
 
v. Weeks, 104 Hawai' i 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 161 (2004). 
Historically, collateral estoppel required mutuality and privity 
between the parties. Bernhard v. Bank of Am. Nat'l Trust & 
Savings Ass'n, 19 Cal. 2d 807, 811, 122 P.2d 892, 894 (1942). Hawai'i courts have moved away from this traditional requirement 
to a modern doctrine that recognizes nonmutual defensive and offensive collateral estoppel. See Ellis v. Crockett, 51 Haw. 
45, 54-57, 451 P.2d 814, 821-23 (1969); Morneau v. Stark Enters., Ltd., 56 Haw. 420, 423-24, 539 P.2d 472, 475 (1975); In re 
Herbert M. Dowsett Trust, 7 Haw. App. 640, 644-48, 791 P.2d 398, 
401-04 (1990); Bush v. Watson, 81 Hawai' i 474, 479-81, 918 P.2d 
1130, 1135-37 (1996). 
In Dorrance v. Lee, 90 Hawai' i 143, 976 P.2d 904 
(1999), the Hawai' i Supreme Court set forth a four-factor 
"collateral estoppel test" to determine whether or not collateral 
estoppel applies. 
We therefore hold that the doctrine of collateral
 
estoppel bars relitigation of an issue where: (1) the issue
decided in the prior adjudication is identical to the one
presented in the action in question; (2) there is a final
judgment on the merits; (3) the issue decided in the prior
adjudication was essential to the final judgment; and (4)
the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a
party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication
[hereinafter, the collateral estoppel test].
 
Id. at 149, 976 P.2d at 910. The party asserting collateral 
estoppel carries the burden of establishing that the factors have 
been met. Lingle v. Hawai' i Gov't Employees Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 
152, AFL-CIO, 107 Hawai' i 178, 186, 111 P.3d 587, 595 (2005).

In Tradewind Ins. Co. v. Stout, 85 Hawai' i 177, 938 
P.2d 1196 (App. 1997), this court considered equitable factors to 
ensure that the due process rights of a non-party to the prior 
decision were not violated when collateral estoppel was applied. 
[D]ue process requires that the estopped party have an
identity or community of interest with, and adequate
representation by, the losing party in the first action and
reasonably expects to be bound by the prior adjudication.
[Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Yon, 796 P.2d 1040, 1044 (Idaho
Ct. App. 1990).] When applying this rule, . . . various
equitable factors . . . must be considered:
 
Whether it would be generally unfair in the second
case to use the result of the first case, whether
assertion of the plea of estoppel by a stranger to the
judgment would create anomalous [results], whether the
party adversely affected by the collateral estoppel
offers a sound reason why he should not be bound by
the judgment, and whether the first case was litigated
strenuously or with vigor.
 
Id. at 1045[.]
 
85 Hawai' i at 187-88, 938 P.2d at 1206-07 (brackets in original 
omitted).
 
In 2004, the Hawai' i Supreme Court expanded the 
doctrine of collateral estoppel when it issued its landmark
 
decision in Exotics Hawai' i-Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours 
& Co., 104 Hawai' i 358, 90 P.3d 250 (2004), affirmatively 
recognizing the doctrine of nonmutual offensive issue
 
preclusion.9 The court held:
 
In sum, inasmuch as (1) we have acknowledged that "it
is not necessary that the party asserting issue preclusion
in the second suit was a party in the first suit," Bremer,
 104 Hawai' i at 54, 85 P.3d at 161, (2) we find [Parklane 
Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 99 S. Ct. 645 (1979),]
and Tradewind to be persuasive, and (3) we believe that the
use of nonmutual offensive issue preclusion will assist our
courts in preventing unnecessary relitigation of issues and
will promote consistency of judgments and judicial economy,
we now explicitly adopt and recognize the doctrine of
nonmutual offensive issue preclusion.

 In Exotics Hawai' i-Kona, the Hawai' i Supreme Court used the term
"issue preclusion" instead of "collateral estoppel." 104 Hawai' i at 365 n.14,
90 P.3d at 257 n.14. For purposes of this opinion, the terms are usedinterchangeably.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Id. at 371, 90 P.3d at 263 (brackets in original omitted). In 
addition to reiterating the four-factor Dorrance test, the 
Exotics Hawai' i-Kona court held that nonmutual offensive "issue 
preclusion should be qualified or rejected when its application would contravene an overriding public policy or result in 
manifest injustice." 104 Hawai' i at 372, 90 P.3d at 264 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
In the "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part 
[UPW's] Motion for Summary Disposition Filed on March 24, 2008," as corrected, the Arbitrator applied the Dorrance collateral 
estoppel test and determined the four-factor test was met. 
Specifically, the Arbitrator determined that (1) the issues 
decided in the 2003 Parnell Award were identical to the ones 
presented in the instant case, (2) the 2003 Parnell Award was a 
final judgment on the merits, (3) the issues decided were 
essential to the 2003 Parnell final judgment, and (4) the party 
against whom collateral estoppel was asserted (County) was a 
party or in privity with a party in the 2003 Parnell Award (the 
State of Hawai' i, University of Hawai' i). 
The Arbitrator provided an extensive analysis of the 
fourth factor, privity, and based his finding of privity between 
County and the State of Hawai' i, University of Hawai' i on two 
principles. The first principle was the contractual relationship among the employer group members,
10 as well as with UPW, mandated 
by HRS Chapter 89 and established by the CBA. The Arbitrator noted that all the employer members and UPW were signatories to 
the CBA. Privity traditionally exists among parties to a 
contract. Headwaters Inc. v. United States Forest Serv., 399 
F.3d 1047, 1053 (9th Cir. 2005). 
10
 The members of the employer group included: The State of Hawai' i,
the Judiciary, the City and County of Honolulu, County of Maui, County of
Hawaii, County of Kauai, and Hawaii Health Systems Corporation. 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The second principle the Arbitrator applied was the
 
public policy exception of a pre-existing substantive legal
 
relationship. This exception was recognized in a 2008 United
 
States Supreme Court case addressing the split among the circuit
 
courts regarding privity and the application of collateral
 
estoppel. In Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 128 S. Ct. 2161
 
(2008), the Supreme Court listed six categories of recognized
 
public policy exceptions to nonmutual issue preclusion, including
 
the consideration of a pre-existing legal relationship. Id. at
 
893-95, 128 S. Ct. at 2172-73. 
The Arbitrator found that a pre-existing substantive
 
legal relationship had existed since 1971 among the employer
 group members, as evidenced by the statutory mandate under
 
Chapter 89 and the fifteen successive CBAs.
 
The Arbitrator was satisfied that the Dorrance factors
 
had been met, state and federal case law supported the
 
application of nonmutual offensive issue preclusion, and it was
 
not against public policy to apply collateral estoppel -- in
 
particular, nonmutual offensive issue preclusion. 
We note that in a recent federal arbitration case, the
 
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that
 
(1) arbitrators are not free to ignore the preclusive effect
of prior judgments under the doctrines of res judicata and
collateral estoppel, (2) arbitrators are entitled to
determine in the first instance whether the prerequisites
for collateral estoppel are satisfied, and (3) arbitrators
possess broad discretion to determine when they should apply
offensive non-mutual collateral estoppel.
 
Collins v. D.R. Horton, Inc., 505 F.3d 874, 882 (9th Cir. 2007)
 
(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
Even if the Arbitrator applied the law incorrectly, 
when parties agree to arbitrate, they "assume all the hazards of 
the arbitration process including the risk that the arbitrators 
may make mistakes in the application of law and in their findings 
of fact." Tatibouet, 99 Hawai' i at 233, 54 P.3d at 404 (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). Where the arbitration 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
award was made in good faith, County is not "permitted to prove
 
that the arbitrator[] decided wrong either as to the law or the
 
facts of the case." Id. at 236, 54 P.3d at 407. 
County argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his scope of
 
authority when he decided the issue of collateral estoppel
 
because that issue had not been submitted to him as required
 
under Section 15.20b.4 of the CBA.
 
The CBA defines the scope of an arbitrator's authority
 
in rendering his decision and award:
 
15.20 AWARD.
 
15.20a. The Arbitrator shall render the award in writing no
later than thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of
the hearing(s) and submission of briefs provided, however,
the submission of briefs may be waived by mutual agreement
between the Union and the Employer.
 
15.20b. The award of the Arbitrator shall be final and
 
binding provided, the award is within the scope of the
Arbitrator's authority as described as follows:
 
15.20b.1. The Arbitrator shall not have the power to add
to, subtract from, disregard, alter, or modify any of the
sections of this Agreement.
 
15.20b.2. The Arbitrator shall be limited to deciding
whether the Employer has violated, misinterpreted, or
misapplied any of the sections of this Agreement.
 
15.20b.3. A matter that is not specifically set forth in
this Agreement shall not be subject to arbitration.
 15.20b.4. The Arbitrator shall not consider allegations
which have not been alleged in Steps 1 and 2.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Under Section 15.20b.4., the arbitrator may not
 
consider allegations that were not alleged at Step 1 or Step 2 of
 
the grievance process. However, the arbitrator may consider a
 
request for summary disposition under HRS § 658A-15(b)(2) (Supp.
 
2010), which provides that, with notification to the other
 
parties, a party may ask an arbitrator to "decide a request for
 
summary disposition of a claim or particular issue."
 
Here, UPW filed a motion for summary disposition to
 
estop County from re-litigating the issue of holiday pay. It was
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
within the Arbitrator's authority to consider the issue of 
collateral estoppel when addressing UPW's request for summary 
disposition, in keeping with the goal of promoting judicial 
economy, avoiding inconsistent results, and providing an 
efficient and less costly procedure. Exotics Hawai' i-Kona, 104 
Hawai'i at 365, 90 P.3d at 257; Uniform Arbitration Act, § 15 
cmt. 2 (2000). 
County contends the Arbitrator exceeded his scope of
 
authority in violation of public policy. 
County argues that the
 
Arbitrator materially altered the CBA by making an award in one
 grievance final and binding on parties in another grievance. 
County asserts that this alleged material alteration of the CBA
 
violated public policy by denying the employees their right to
 
participate in the collective bargaining process.
 
County acknowledges that HRS Chapter 89 requires
 
multi-party negotiations of the CBA, but contends the application
 
of collateral estoppel will force the public employers to
 
collectively administer the CBA, which materially alters the CBA. 
County suggests that the public employers will each need to
 
monitor grievances filed against any of the other employers in
 
the employer group to protect their own interests. County argues
 
that this alleged joint administration violates the intent of
 
Chapter 89 to "promote efficient and orderly government
 
operations" and represents a material change in the CBA. County
 
also argues that applying collateral estoppel impacts each
 
employer's right to "[d]etermine methods, means, and personnel by
 
which the employer's operations are to be conducted," as provided
 
under HRS § 89-9(d)(7).
 
Because County and UPW agreed under the CBA to have an
 
arbitrator rather than a judge resolve disputes, "it is the
 
arbitrator's view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract
 
that [County and UPW] have agreed to accept." United
 
Paperworkers Int'l Union, 484 U.S. at 37-38, 108 S. Ct. at 370. 
In spite of County's public policy claim that the Arbitrator's
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
interpretation of the CBA represented a material alteration of
 
the CBA, the essence of the argument is that the Arbitrator
 
misinterpreted the CBA and the statute.
 
Insofar as County attempts to raise a public policy
 
question, a court may not enforce a contract "that is contrary to
 
public policy." W.R. Grace & Co., 461 U.S. at 766, 103 S. Ct. at
 
2183. It follows that "[i]f the contract as interpreted [by an
 arbitrator] violates some explicit public policy, [the courts]
 
are obliged to refrain from enforcing it." Id. To apply an
 
exception to the deference generally given arbitration awards,
 
the public policy exception requires a court to determine
that (1) the award would violate some explicit public policy
that is well defined and dominant, and that is ascertained
by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from
general considerations of supposed public interests, and (2)
the violation of the public policy is clearly shown. Hence,
a refusal to enforce an arbitration award must rest on more
 than speculation or assumption.
 
Inlandboatmen's Union, 77 Hawai' i at 193-94, 881 P.2d at 1261-62 
(internal quotation marks, citations, brackets, and ellipsis 
omitted). 
County fails to clearly show a violation of an
 
explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy, which is
 
necessary for a court to recognize the limited public policy
 
exception to the general deference given to arbitration awards. 
"[C]ourts have no business overruling [the arbitrator] because
 
their interpretation of the contract is different from [the
 
arbitrator's]." United Steelworkers of Am. v. Enter. Wheel & Car
 
Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 599, 80 S. Ct. 1358, 1362 (1960). "[A]s
 long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying
 
the contract and acting within the scope of his authority," a
 
court may not overturn his decision. United Paperworkers Int'l
 
Union, 484 U.S. at 38, 108 S. Ct. at 371. The First Circuit
 Court did not err in confirming the Arbitration Award. 
Because we affirm the Judgment of the First Circuit
 
Court, thereby concluding this appeal, we consider UPW's
 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contention that the First Circuit Court erred in staying the
 
enforcement of its Judgment pending appeal to be moot.
 
IV.

Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
