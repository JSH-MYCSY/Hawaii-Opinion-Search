APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2220)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Petitioner-Appellant Todd B. Weeks ("Weeks") appeals
 
from the "Order Denying Writ of Habeas Corpus L1892 Chapter 57
 
Section 5, Common Law of the Hawaiian Islands; L1892 Chapter 57
 Section 37 (Eigth [sic]), to Issue Writ of Habeas Corpus, Filed
 September 15, 2009; and Denying HRS 660-6 and 660-7 Order to Show
 Cause, Filed September 24, 2009" ("Order"), filed on
 September 29, 2009, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 ("Circuit Court").

In the Order, the Circuit Court denied Weeks's (1)
 
"Writ of Habeas Corpus L1892 Chapter 57 Section 5, Common Law of
 the Hawaiian Islands; L1892 Chapter 57 Section 37 (Eigth [sic])
 to Issue Writ of Habeas Corpus" ("Habeas Petition"), filed on
 September 15, 2009; and (2) motion for an order to show cause,
 filed on September 24, 2009 (collectively, "Motions"). The court
 denied the Motions on the basis that they were not in compliance

 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
with Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") ยง 660-5 (1993).2
 
On appeal, Weeks appears to argue that the Circuit
 
Court erroneously denied his Motions because (1) he was denied
 
effective assistance of counsel, where the public defender knew
 that he was "nowhere near the vehicle nor was my prints found in
 the car that I am serving time for" and yet told Weeks that he
 did not "have a chance against the charges"; and (2) the court
 lacked jurisdiction over him because he is "a citizen of Hawaii
 and therefore should be tried in the Common law venue court of
 the Country of Hawaii." Weeks asks that we dismiss all charges
 against him and expunge his record accordingly. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Weeks's points of error as follows: 
2
 HRS ยง 660-5 provides:
 
ยง 660-5. Complaint. Application for the writ or an
order to show cause shall be made to the court or judge
authorized to issue the same, by complaint in writing,
signed by the party for whose relief it is intended, or by
some person in the party's behalf, setting forth:
 
(1)	 The person by whom, and the place where, the
party is imprisoned or restrained, naming the
party and the person detaining the party, if
their names are known, and describing them if
they are not known; 
(2)	 The cause or pretense of imprisonment or
restraint, according to the knowledge and belief
of the applicant; 
(3)	 If the imprisonment or restraint is by virtue of
any warrant or other process, an annexed copy
thereof, unless it is made to appear that a
sufficient reason exists for not annexing the
same;
 
(4)	 That there has been no determination of the
 legality of the detention on a prior application
for a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, or,
if there has been a previous determination, the
new grounds, if any, not presented and
determined upon the previous application. 
The facts alleged shall be verified by the oath of
some credible person, to be administered by any person
authorized to administer oaths.

Instead of denying the Motions on the basis that they 
were not in compliance with HRS ยง 660-5, the Circuit Court should 
have treated them as petitions for post-conviction relief under Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40. Haw. R. Pen. P. 
40(a) and 40(c)(2); see State v. Villanueva, No. 30137, 2010 WL 2513330, *1 (Haw. App. July 21, 2010). 
HRPP Rule 40(c)(2) requires that a nonconforming
 
petition should be treated as an HRPP Rule 40 petition under
 certain conditions. It also sets forth procedures for the
 circuit court to follow when treating a nonconforming petition as
 an HRPP Rule 40 petition. The rule provides, in relevant part,
 that:
 
Where a post-conviction petition deviates from the
form annexed to these rules, it shall nevertheless be
accepted for filing and shall be treated as a petition under
this rule provided that the petition (i) claims illegality
of a judgment or illegality or "custody" or "restraint"
arising out of a judgment, (ii) is accompanied by the
necessary filing fee or by a well-founded request to proceed
without paying filing fees, and (iii) meets minimum
standards of legibility and regularity.
 
Haw. R. Pen. P. 40(c)(2). The Motions are legible and appear to
 
claim that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction over Weeks and
 that, therefore, the judgment against him and its sentence of him
 were illegal. In addition, the Circuit Court granted Weeks's
 request to proceed in forma pauperis.
 Any failure on Weeks's part to comply with the
 
requirements of HRPP Rule 40 should have been addressed by an
 order instructing him to abide by the rule. Haw. R. Pen. P.
 40(c)(2).
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Order Denying Writ of
 
Habeas Corpus L1892 Chapter 57 Section 5, Common Law of the
 Hawaiian Islands; L1892 Chapter 57 Section 37 (Eigth [sic]), to
 Issue Writ of Habeas Corpus, Filed September 15, 2009; and
 Denying HRS 660-6 and 660-7 Order to Show Cause, Filed
 September 24, 2009," filed on September 29, 2009, in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit is vacated and this case is remanded
 for the Circuit Court to address the "Writ of Habeas Corpus L1892
