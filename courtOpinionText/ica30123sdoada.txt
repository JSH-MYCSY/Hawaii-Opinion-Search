 Segundo designated the wrong order in her October 19, 2009 notice
of appeal where she sought review of the Order Denying Defendant Juliet

Nevertheless, Segundo filed her notice of appeal within thirty daysafter the September 29, 2009 deemed denial of Defendant's Motion for Stayand/or to Set Aside Order and Judgment Granting Plaintiff's Motion for SummaryJudgment, and for Writ of Ejectment Against Juliet Segundo Filed April 17,2009, Filed June 25, 2009, filed July 1, 2009, as required by Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(3). Furthermore, Hawai' i appellate courts have
generally held that "a mistake in designating the judgment . . . should notresult in [the] loss of the appeal as long as the intention to appeal from aspecific judgment can be fairly inferred from the notice and the appellee is
not misled by the mistake." State v. Graybeard, 93 Hawai' i 513, 516, 6 P.3d
385, 388 (App. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting City & Cnty. of Midkiff, 57 Haw. 273, 275–76, 554 P.2d 233, 235 (1976)). Therefore,
Segundo's October 19, 2009 notice of appeal effectively asserts an appeal fromthe June 25, 2009 Judgment.

Appellee Avelo Mortgage, LLC ("Avelo") and against Segundo.
 
On appeal, Segundo asserts three points of error.3
 
Specifically, Segundo contends that the Circuit Court (1) did not
 
have jurisdiction to hear ejectment matters; (2) erred by not
 dismissing Avelo's action for Avelo's failure to produce a
 "ratification"; and (3) erred by denying Segundo's prayers for
 the production of the "ratification" without issuing a written
 decision.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Segundo's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The Circuit Court had jurisdiction over the case. 
Avelo was the holder of the promissory note and was assigned the mortgage on the property. Segundo failed to present a dispute of material fact as to whether Avelo acquired title to the property pursuant to a non-judicial foreclosure.
4 Avelo's Quitclaim Deed, 
recorded on June 9, 2008 with the Office of the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of Hawai' i, specifies Avelo as owner of 
the property. 
Insofar as Avelo is the record owner of the property as
 
evidenced by the aforementioned quitclaim deed, Avelo was
 entitled to a writ of ejectment. Carter v. Kaikainahaole, 14
 
Haw. 515, 516 (Haw. Terr. 1902) (explaining that "a complainant

who has the title to and right of possession of certain land and
 
from whom possession is unlawfully withheld by another" is
 entitled to "the ordinary remedy at law of an action of
 ejectment"). "The Circuit Court has jurisdiction over civil
 actions and proceedings. Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 603–21.5. A complaint for ejectment is a civil action or
 proceeding within the meaning of HRS § 603–21.5." RMS
 
Residential Properties, LLC v. Valdez, No. 30563, 2011 WL
 5903824, *1 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 22, 2011). Therefore, the
 Circuit Court had jurisdiction to enter the Writ of Ejectment.

(2) The Circuit Court did not "inappropriately process" 
Avelo's claim. Segundo appears to claim that Avelo was required to produce a ratification of commencement pursuant to Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 17(a). If an action is prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, however, no ratification of commencement is required. See Haw. R. Civ. P. 
17(a). As the holder of the promissory note and assignee of the mortgage, Avelo was the real party in interest. See 6A Charles 
Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 1543 (3d ed.) (an action "must be brought by the person who, according to the governing substantive law, is entitled to enforce the right."). Thus, Segundo has not shown error. 
(3) Segundo claims that the Circuit Court violated her 
due process rights by failing to adhere to Circuit Court Rule 24. The rule, however, concerns only notification of the issuance of findings of fact and conclusions of law; Hawai' i Rules of Civil

 There are limited circumstances, not present here, in which the
district courts have exclusive jurisdiction of ejectment cases. See H AW. REV.
 
STAT. §§ 603-21.5 and 604-5 (Supp. 2011).

Procedure Rule 52 otherwise controls the issuance of findings of
 
fact and conclusions of law. See Cir. Ct. R. 24; Haw. R. Civ. P.
 52. Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err. Haw. R. Civ. P. 
52(a) ("Findings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under Rules 12 or 56 or any other motion except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this rule."); Hawaii Cmty. Fed. Credit Union v. Keka, 94 Hawai' i 213, 216 n.3, 
11 P.3d 1, 4 n.3 (2000). 
Therefore, the June 25, 2009 Judgment of the Circuit
 
Court of the Second Circuit is affirmed.
