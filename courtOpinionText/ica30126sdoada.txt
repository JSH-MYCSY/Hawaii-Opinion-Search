Respondent-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P. NO. 09-1-0268)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Oceanic Companies, Inc. (Oceanic)
 
appeals from the "Order Denying Petitioner Oceanic Companies,
 
Inc.'s Petition to Compel Arbitration Filed August 7, 2009,"
 
filed on September 16, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First
 
Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
On appeal, Oceanic contends that the Circuit Court 
erred by denying its Petition to Compel Arbitration. Oceanic 
claims that a written agreement with Respondent-Appellee 
Kukui'ula Development Company (Hawaii), LLC (KDC) contains a 
provision that requires both parties to participate in binding arbitration at the request of either party. Oceanic argues that 
use of the word "may" in the arbitration provision mandates

arbitration. Oceanic also asserts that because "any doubts
 
concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in
 
favor of arbitration[,]" the circuit court erred in denying its
 
petition to compel arbitration. We disagree with Oceanic's
 
arguments and affirm.
 
I. Background
 
Oceanic filed its Petition to Compel Arbitration 
against KDC on August 7, 2009. Oceanic alleged that on 
October 15, 2007, it entered into a Master Contract under which 
KDC, as owner, engaged Oceanic as the contractor for a project 
located on the island of Kaua 'i. Oceanic further contends that 
in August 2008, KDC reduced the scope of work by $947,287.13, and then in April 2009, KDC sent Oceanic a termination letter after 
the reduced work was completed. Oceanic asserts that KDC must 
pay for lost profits according to their contract and alleges that 
KDC attempted to evade the lost-profit provision by sending the 
notice of termination. 
Oceanic seeks to arbitrate the dispute. It claims that
 
Section 45 of the Master Contract allows either party to initiate
 
arbitration for disputes relating to the Master Contract or work
 
performed pursuant to the Master Contract. Oceanic thus
 
petitioned the Circuit Court to issue an order compelling
 
arbitration between KDC and Oceanic.
 
Section 45 of the Master Contract states:
 
45. ARBITRATION; JURISDICTION; VENUE.  Contractor 
agrees to be joined as a party in any arbitration or
other dispute resolution proceeding in which Owner isa party and which relates to, or arises from, in anyfashion, the Work or this Master Contract. Contractor shall incorporate the preceding sentence in itssubcontracts pursuant to which Contractor'ssubcontractors shall agree to be joined as parties inany arbitration or other dispute resolution proceedingin which Owner and Contractor are parties. Any otherdispute, claim or controversy involving Contractor andOwner and arising out of or related to the Work orthis Master Contract may be resolved by bindingarbitration in County of Kaua' i, State of Hawaii,

administered by the American Arbitration Association
in accordance with its then current Construction
 Industry Rules, and subject to the provisions of
H.R.S. § 601-0020 and Hawaii Arbitration Rules
relating to judicial enforcement of agreements to
arbitrate disputes. Exclusive venue for any
litigation arising from, or in connection with, any
such arbitration, and the enforcement of any
arbitration award, shall be the Superior Court of the
State of Hawaii.
 
On August 24, 2009, KDC filed a Memorandum in
 
Opposition to Petitioner Oceanic Companies, Inc.'s Motion to
 
Compel Arbitration. 
On September 1, 2009, the Circuit Court held a hearing
 
on Oceanic's Petition to Compel Arbitration.
 
On September 23, 2009, the Circuit Court issued its
 
Order Denying Petitioner Oceanic Companies, Inc.'s Petition to
 
Compel Arbitration Filed August 7, 2009. Oceanic timely filed
 
this appeal.
 
II. The Master Contract Does Not Mandate Arbitration
 
We review de novo the Circuit Court's decision denying
 
Oceanic's petition to compel arbitration.
 
A petition to compel arbitration is reviewed de novo.
 
The standard is the same as that which would be
 applicable to a motion for summary judgment, and the
trial court's decision is reviewed using the same
standard employed by the trial court and based upon
the same evidentiary materials as were before it in
determination of the motion.
 
Douglass v. Pflueger Haw., Inc., 110 Hawai 'i 520, 524-25, 135 P.3d 
129, 133-34 (2006) (internal quotation marks, citations, and 
brackets omitted) (quoting Brown v. KFC Nat'l Mgmt. Co., 82 Hawai 'i 
226, 231, 921 P.2d 146, 151 (1996)). 
"[W]hen presented with a motion to compel arbitration,
 
the court is limited to answering two questions: 1) whether an
 arbitration agreement exists between the parties; and 2) if so,
 
whether the subject matter of the dispute is arbitrable under
 
such agreement." Hawaii Med. Ass'n v. Hawaii Med. Serv. Ass'n,
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
113 Hawai 'i 77, 91, 148 P.3d 1179, 1193 (2006) (quoting Ko 'olau 
Radiology, Inc. v. Queen's Med. Ctr., 73 Haw. 433, 445, 834 P.2d 
1294, 1300 (1992)). In this case, we are presented with the 
former question: whether an arbitration agreement exists which 
mandates arbitration. 
"Arbitration is a matter of contract; so a party cannot 
be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not 
agreed so to submit." Sher v. Cella, 114 Hawai 'i 263, 267, 160 
P.3d 1250, 1254 (App. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). "[A]n agreement should be construed as a 
whole and its meaning determined from the entire context and not 
from any particular word, phrase or clause." Leeward Bus Co. v. 
City and County of Honolulu, 58 Haw. 64, 68-69, 564 P.2d 445, 448 (1977) (quoting Ching v. Hawaiian Rests. Ltd., 50 Haw. 563, 565, 
445 P.2d 370, 372 (1968)). "Absent an ambiguity, contract terms 
should be interpreted according to their plain, ordinary, and 
accepted sense in common speech." Hi Kai Inv., Ltd. v. Aloha 
Futons Beds & Waterbeds, Inc., 84 Hawai
'i 75, 78, 929 P.2d 88, 91 
(1996) (quoting Cho Mark Oriental Food v. K.K. Int'l, 73 Haw. 
509, 520, 836 P.2d 1057, 1064 (1992)). 
In this case, construing the Master Contract as a
 
whole, determining the meaning of the arbitration provision in
 
the entire context of the Master Contract, and interpreting the
 
arbitration provision according to its plain meaning, we conclude
 
that arbitration is not mandated in this matter.
 
First and foremost, the phrase "agrees to be joined"
 
and the words "shall" and "may" are utilized in a particular and
 
meaningful way in the arbitration provision set out at Section 45
 
of the Master Contract. The first two sentences of Section 45
 
evidence a clear intent, by explicit and mandatory language, that
 
Oceanic and its subcontractors agree to be joined in any
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
arbitration where KDC is a party and which relates, inter alia,
 
to the Master Contract.
 
Contractor agrees to be joined as a party in any arbitration
or other dispute resolution proceeding in which Owner is a
party and which relates to, or arises from, in any fashion,
the Work or this Master Contract. Contractor shall
 incorporate the preceding sentence in its subcontracts
pursuant to which Contractor's subcontractors shall agree to
be joined as parties in any arbitration or other dispute
resolution proceeding in which Owner and Contractor are
parties.
 
(Emphasis added.) By direct contrast, the relevant sentence in
 
Section 45 dealing with other disputes between Oceanic and KDC
 
uses permissive language and provides that such disputes "may be
 
resolved by binding arbitration" according to the terms set forth
 
therein. 
Any other dispute, claim or controversy involving Contractor
and Owner and arising out of or related to the Work or this
Master Contract may be resolved by binding arbitration inCounty of Kaua' i, State of Hawaii, administered by the
American Arbitration Association in accordance with its then 
current Construction Industry Rules, and subject to theprovisions of H.R.S. § 601-0020 and Hawaii Arbitration Rulesrelating to judicial enforcement of agreements to arbitratedisputes. 
(Emphasis added.) The juxtaposition of mandatory and permissive
 
language in such proximity and usage demonstrates an intentional
 
distinction between what is required and what is not required.2
 
Second, we disagree with Oceanic's contention that 
there is a "rule in Hawai 'i that once one party initiates 
arbitration, both parties are then required to participate." To the contrary, we must look to the entirety of the Master Contract 
2 Section 45 of the Master Contract also curiously refers to Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 601-20 (1993), relating to the Court Annexed
Arbitration Program (CAAP), and the Hawai' i Arbitration Rules. The CAAP 
pertains to certain civil actions in tort which are submitted to non-bindingarbitration pursuant to court rules. HRS § 601-20; Hawai' i Arbitration Rules,
Rule 1. The CAAP does not apply to cases such as the instant one. See 
Hawai'i Arbitration Rules, Rule 2 (providing that "[t]hese rules shall not be
applicable to arbitration by private agreement or to other forms ofarbitration under existing statutes, policies, and procedures."). The reference in the Master Contract to HRS § 601-20 further diminishes any effortto suggest that arbitration was intended to be mandatory in this case. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to discern the intent of the parties. In this regard, the cases
 
that Oceanic cites from other jurisdictions are not dispositive
 
because, although they address arbitration provisions containing
 
the word "may," each of the provisions is distinct from the
 
arbitration provision in the instant case. That is, unlike in
 
this case, the language of the arbitration provisions in those
 
cases do not first indicate where arbitration is mandated by use
 
of the word "shall" and then utilize the permissive word "may"
 
for arbitration in different circumstances.
 
Additionally, in many of the cases that Oceanic cites,
 
unlike this case, the arbitration provisions express that one
 
party has the ability to trigger or invoke arbitration. See Am.
 
Italian Pasta Co. v. Austin Co., 914 F.2d 1103, 1104 (8th Cir.
 1990) (considering provision that a dispute "may be submitted to
 
arbitration in accordance with the Rules of The American
 
Arbitration Association in which event, the decision of the
 
arbitrators shall be final and binding upon the parties.")
 
(emphasis added); Place St. Charles v. J.A. Jones Constr. Co.,
 
823 F.2d 120, 122 (5th Cir. 1987) (addressing provision that
 
states, in part, "Owner or Contractor may invoke arbitration, and
 
each agrees to be bound by the result. . . .") (emphasis added);
 
United States v. Bankers Ins. Co., 245 F.3d 315, 318 (4th Cir.
 
2001) (addressing a provision that a "dispute may be submitted to
 
arbitration for a determination [that] shall be binding. . . .")
 
(emphasis added); Deaton Truck Line, Inc. v. Local Union 612, 314
 
F.2d 418, 421 (5th Cir. 1962) (considering provision that "the
 
dispute may be submitted to the arbitration and the decision of
 
the arbiter shall be final."); Bonnot v. Congress of Indep.
 
Unions Local #14, 331 F.2d 355, 356 (8th Cir. 1964) (considering
 
provision that "either party may request arbitration and follow
 
the following procedure . . .") (emphasis added).
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Similarly, Oceanic's reliance on Wailua Assocs. v.
 
Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 904 F. Supp. 1142 (D. Haw. 1995) is not
 
helpful. The issue there was not whether use of the word "may"
 
expressed an intent for mandatory arbitration. Moreover, the
 
arbitration provision in Wailua Assocs., unlike in the instant
 
case, made explicit that either party could demand arbitration
 
and set forth the procedure the parties would follow upon such
 
demand, stating: "If we and you disagree on the value of the
 
property or the amount of loss, either may make written demand
 
for an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will
 
select a competent and impartial appraiser." Id. at 1145
 
(emphasis added).
 
In its Reply Brief, Oceanic appears to cite Young
 
Bros., Ltd. v. Int'l Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 142,
 250 F. Supp. 2d 1244 (D. Haw. 2003), for the proposition that use
 
of the word "may" provides one party with the option of invoking
 
binding arbitration. Oceanic quotes Young Bros. as holding that
 
"[t]he court held that "the word 'may' means that [Young
 
Brothers] has the option to arbitrate, even though not all
 
disputes must be submitted to an arbitrator." However, Young
 
Bros. is inapposite because the arbitration provision in that
 
case gave only one party, the plaintiff, the option to initiate
 
arbitration. The defendant sought to dismiss the plaintiff's
 
suit on the ground that, inter alia, the plaintiff's claims had
 
to be arbitrated. Young Bros., 250 F. Supp. 2d at 1247-48. The
 
court in Young Bros. stated:
 
Defendants seem to assert that because Article 36
 
provides for an expedited arbitration procedure,
Plaintiff is bound to engage in arbitration.
Defendants argued at the hearing that "may" could mean
"shall" or "must" in the proper context. This
conclusion is flawed for the obvious reason that a
 party is not bound to participate in a proceeding that
is essentially voluntary. The court agrees that the
word "may" means that Plaintiff has the option to
arbitrate. There is no textual basis for asserting
that all issues regarding and related to the no-strike
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
provision in Article 23 were required to be heard and
resolved by an arbitrator.
 
Id. at 1249-50 (emphasis added).
 
Third, we also disagree with Oceanic's assertion that 
the Circuit Court's interpretation renders the arbitration
 
provision illusory. Instead, the provision evidences an intent
 
to lay out the procedures that would be followed if arbitration
 
were to occur. 
Fourth, Oceanic quotes Lee v. Heftel, 81 Hawai 'i 1, 911 
P.2d 721 (1996) for the proposition that "[a]ny doubts concerning 
the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of 
arbitration." Id. at 4, 911 P.2d at 724 (citation and quotation 
marks omitted). The asserted presumption is inapplicable here 
because it applies to the scope of arbitration and not whether, 
as here, an agreement to arbitrate exists. The issue of the 
scope of arbitration arises only if an agreement to arbitrate 
exists. See Hawaii Med. Ass'n, 113 Hawai 'i at 91, 148 P.3d at 
1193.
