two days in jail and two years of probation, in addition to fees.
This timely appeal followed.
Boots raises three points on appeal: (1) the Family
Court lacked substantial evidence to support the conclusion that
Jazmin Boots's (Jazmin) physical intervention in the argument
 
between Boots and Janice Boots (Janice) was "not unlawful force";
 
(2) the Family Court erred by holding that Boots could not rely
on a self-defense claim; and (3) Boots was denied effective
assistance of counsel because his trial counsel (Trial Counsel)
 
did not challenge Jazmin's perception of the events by
introducing evidence or eliciting testimony related to her mental
health and medication history and for failing to call Jinjer
Boots (Jinjer) as a witness.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Boots's
contentions as follows:
 
(1) Unlawful force is
 
force which is employed without the consent of the person
against whom it is directed and the employment of which
constitutes an offense or would constitute an offense except
for a defense not amounting to a justification to use the
force. Assent constitutes consent, within the meaning of
this section, whether or not it otherwise is legally
effective, except assent to the infliction of death or
serious or substantial bodily injury.
 
HRS § 703-300 (1993) (emphasis added). Therefore, an actor's use
 
of force is "not unlawful" if she has a defense amounting to a
 
2/(...continued)
(a) For the first offense the person shall serve a
minimum jail sentence of forty-eight hours; and
(b) For a second offense that occurs within one year
of the first conviction, the person shall be termed a
"repeat offender" and serve a minimum jail sentence of
thirty days.
 
Upon conviction and sentencing of the defendant, the court
shall order that the defendant immediately be incarcerated
to serve the mandatory minimum sentence imposed; provided
that the defendant may be admitted to bail pending appeal
pursuant to chapter 804. The court may stay the imposition
of the sentence if special circumstances exist.
 . . . .

justification to the use of force. See HRS § 703-301 (1993); HRS
 
§ 703-300. One such justification is the use of force for the
 
3
protection of others,  as provided in HRS § 703-305(1):
[T]he use of force upon or toward the person of another is
justifiable to protect a third person when: (a) Under the
circumstances as the actor believes
4 them to be, the person
whom the actor seeks to protect would be justified in using
such protective force; and (b) The actor believes that the
actor's intervention is necessary for the protection of the
other person.
 
(Footnote added.) The attendant circumstances when determining 
whether this type of justification applies "must be viewed from a 
subjective point of view, that is, as the [actor] believes them 
to be." State v. Pavao, 81 Hawai' i 142, 145, 913 P.2d 553, 556 
(App. 1996) (citing HRS § 703-305; quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
Boots correctly notes that Jazmin did not explicitly
 
testify that she intervened in her parents' argument in order to
 
protect Janice. However, substantial evidence exists to support
 
the Family Court's conclusion that Jazmin's use of force was "not
 
unlawful." The Family Court, as trier of fact, was "free to make
 
all reasonable and rational inferences under the facts in
 
evidence, including circumstantial evidence." State v. Batson,
 
73 Haw. 236, 249, 831 P.2d 924, 931 (1992) (citation omitted). 
Jazmin testified that: (1) she heard her parents arguing in her
 
sisters' room; (2) she heard a "thud," followed by her sisters
 
screaming; and (3) upon arriving at her sisters' room, Jazmin saw
 
Janice on the floor and her two sisters pushing Boots. From this
 
testimony, the Family Court could have reasonably inferred that
 
Jazmin believed that Boots had pushed or otherwise harmed Janice. 
3/
 Although the use of force is also justifiable for self-protection,
 
see HRS § 703-304 (1993 & Supp. 2011), there is no indication that, prior to
Jazmin's use of force, she "believe[d] that such force [was] immediately
necessary for the purpose of protecting [herself] against the use of unlawful
force" by Boots. Id.
 
4/
 Under HRS Chapter 703, "'[b]elieves' means reasonably believes."
HRS § 703-300.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
This inference would provide substantial evidence to support the
 
Family Court's conclusion that Jazmin's force was not unlawful,
 
as Jazmin could have reasonably believed that Janice herself
 
would be justified in using force to protect herself, and that
 
Jazmin's intervention was necessary to protect Janice. See HRS
 
§§ 703-305(1)(a) and 703-305(1)(b). Accordingly, there was
 substantial evidence to support the Family Court's conclusion
 
that Jazmin's use of force was not unlawful.
 
(2) Justification, including self-protection, is a 
defense in a prosecution for an offense. HRS § 703-301. HRS 
§ 703-304(1) provides for the justifiable use of force for self-
protection: "[T]he use of force upon or toward another person is 
justifiable when the actor believes that such force is 
immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself 
against the use of unlawful force by the other person on the 
present occasion." When deciding whether a defendant's use of 
force is justified as self-defense, courts must view the 
situation from the point of view of the defendant. State v. 
Straub, 9 Haw. App. 435, 445, 843 P.2d 1389, 1394 (1993) (citation omitted). Once evidence of justification has been 
adduced, the prosecution bears the burden of disproving it beyond 
a reasonable doubt. State v. Culkin, 97 Hawai' i 206, 215, 35 
P.3d 233, 242 (2001) (citing HRS § 702-205(b) (1993)). 
In this case, Boots did not testify or present other
 
evidence that he believed that force was necessary to protect
 himself against unlawful force employed by Jazmin. Instead,
 
Boots flatly denied striking Jazmin. When asked whether he had
 
touched Jazmin on the day of the incident, Boots responded: "I
 
did not. I didn't hit her. I didn't shove her. I didn't hold
 
her against the wall. No." 
Because Boots did not proffer any evidence supporting
 
that he reasonably believed force was necessary to protect
 
himself against what he perceived as Jazmin's unlawful force, he
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
failed to present a self-protection defense. Although it is
 
clear that the Family Court considered a defense of self-
protection, evidence supporting such a defense was not presented,
 
nor did Boots actually rely on such an argument below.5 There is
 
no merit in Boots's argument that the Family Court erred in
 rejecting self-defense as a justification.
 
(3) It is well-established that
 
When an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is raised,
the defendant has the burden of establishing: 1) that there
were specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack
of skill, judgment, or diligence; and 2) that such errors or
omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial
 impairment of a potentially meritorious defense.
 
State v. Jones, 96 Hawai' i 161, 166, 29 P.3d 351, 356 (2001) 
(citation omitted). 
Boots posits that Trial Counsel was ineffective because 
she did not cross-examine Jazmin regarding her bipolar disorder 
and the fact that she was not taking medication at the time of 
the incident. The decision to conduct cross-examination and the 
nature of its questioning is generally the province of counsel as 
a strategic decision. State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 39, 960 
P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998). In addition, Boots has not carried his burden of establishing that Trial Counsel's failure to make the 
inquiries he desired reflected her lack of skill, judgment, or 
diligence, or how such an omission resulted in the withdrawal or 
substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. See 
State v. Higa, 126 Hawai' i 247, 260-61, 269 P.3d 782, 795-96 
(App. 2012). 
Boots cites authority describing the possible symptoms
 
of bipolar disorder, including the impairment of cognitive and
 
5/
 Boots's defense at trial was that he did not strike Jazmin and 
that her injuries occurred as a result of Jazmin scraping her back against a
light switch. As a result of Boots's failure to properly present a theory ofself-protection, the prosecution was not required to disprove such a defense.See Culkin, 97 Hawai' i at 215, 35 P.3d at 242 ("Self-defense is not an
affirmative defense, and the prosecution has the burden of disproving it onceevidence of justification has been adduced." (citations omitted)).

behavioral functions. See Agyeman v. I.N.S., 296 F.3d 871, 881
 
(9th Cir. 2002) (citing Paul E. Keck, Jr., et al., Bipolar
 
Disorder, 85 The Medical Clinics of North America 645 (2001)). 
However, there is nothing on the record to indicate that the type
 
of bipolar disorder Jazmin was allegedly diagnosed with impaired
 
her ability to perceive the events to which she testified to or
 
her ability to tell the truth. Boots cannot simply rely on
 
general propositions related to mental illness and drug use in
 
support of the proposition that such ailments may impair one's
 
ability to perceive or recollect events. See, e.g., United
 
States v. George, 532 F.3d 933, 937 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citing
 United States v. Butt, 955 F.2d 77, 82-83 (1st Cir. 1992)). 
Though they may affect a person with a mental illness in those
 
areas, there is no evidence that Jazmin was affected in such a
 
way at the time of the incident or at trial. Consequently, Boots
 
has not shown how the lack of cross-examination with regard to
 
Jazmin's medical history was a withdrawal or substantial
 
impairment of a potentially meritorious defense.
 
Boots also claims that he was denied effective 
assistance of counsel when Trial Counsel failed to present 
Jinjer's testimony. Like his argument regarding Jazmin's medical 
history, Boots fails to carry his burden of establishing that he 
was denied effective assistance of counsel. See Higa, 126 
Hawai'i at 260-61, 269 P.3d at 795-96. It is widely acknowledged 
that "[t]he decision whether to call witnesses in a criminal case 
is normally a matter within the judgment of counsel and, 
accordingly, will rarely be second-guessed by judicial 
hindsight." Richie, 88 Hawai' i at 40, 960 P.2d at 1248 (quoting 
State v. Aplaca, 74 Haw. 54, 70, 837 P.2d 1298, 1307 (1992)). Boots has failed to obtain supporting affidavits or sworn 
statements describing the testimony of Jinjer. See Richie, 88 
Hawai'i at 39, 960 P.2d at 1247. This failure is fatal to 
Boots's ineffective assistance claim. Id. ("Inasmuch as [the 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
defendant] has not supported his ineffective claim with 
affidavits or sworn statements, his claim fails."); see also 
State v. Reed, 77 Hawai' i 72, 84, 881 P.2d 1218, 1230 (1994) 
overruled on other grounds by State v. Balanza, 93 Hawai' i 279, 1 
P.3d 281 (2000) (holding that without the supporting affidavits 
or sworn statements, the defendant's characterization of the 
witnesses' potential testimony "amounts to nothing more than 
speculation"). Therefore, Boots's ineffective assistance of 
counsel claims are without merit. 
For these reasons, we affirm the Family Court's October
 
27, 2009 Amended Judgment of Conviction and Sentence.
