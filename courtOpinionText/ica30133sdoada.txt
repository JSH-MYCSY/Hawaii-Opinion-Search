SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Walter Wagner, Linda Wagner, and
 
Dan Perkins (collectively, Wagners) appeal from the First Amended
 
Final Judgment filed on September 28, 2009 in the Circuit Court
 
1
of the Third Circuit  (circuit court).  The circuit court entered
 
judgment in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee World Botanical Gardens,

complaint and dismissed without prejudice Count VIII of the
 
complaint.
 
On appeal, Wagners contend:
 (1) The circuit court erred when it denied Wagners'
 
motion for a new trial.
 
(2) The circuit court did not have jurisdiction
 
because the statute of limitations had run on WBG's claims and
 there was no triable issue of material fact.
 
(3) Partial summary judgment in favor of WBG was
 
inappropriate because there existed a triable issue of material
 
fact.
 
(4) The circuit court did not have jurisdiction to
 
enter its First Amended Final Judgment due to a violation of
 
Rule 23 of the Rules of the Circuit Courts.
 Wagners' Opening Brief (OB) fails to conform to 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28. HRAP Rule 
28(b)(3) provides that Wagners must provide in their OB 
[a] concise statement of the case, setting forth the nature
of the case, the course and disposition of proceedings in
the court or agency appealed from, and the facts material to
consideration of the questions and points presented, with
record references supporting each statement of fact or
mention of court or agency proceedings. In presenting those
material facts, all supporting and contradictory evidence
shall be presented in summary fashion, with appropriate
record references. Record references shall include page
citations and the volume number, if applicable. References
 to transcripts shall include the date of the transcript, the
specific page or pages referred to, and the volume number,
if applicable. Lengthy quotations from the record may be
reproduced in the appendix. There shall be appended to the
brief a copy of the judgment, decree, findings of fact and
conclusions of law, order, opinion or decision relevant to
any point on appeal, unless otherwise ordered by the court.
 
Wagners' concise statement of the case fails to set forth the
 
nature of the case, describing the course and disposition of
 
proceedings in the circuit court, or the facts material to the
 
consideration of the points presented. Wagners do not provide
 
record references to every statement of fact or reference to
 
court proceedings or transcripts as required under Rule 28(b)(3). 
Moreover, Wagners did not append to their OB a copy of the
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
judgment, order, or findings of fact and conclusions of law
 
relevant to their points on appeal.
 
Additionally, Wagners' points on appeal are nearly
 
incomprehensible and their arguments do not contain "the
 
contentions of the appellant on the points presented and the
 
reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and
 
parts of the record relied on. . . . Points not argued may be
 
deemed waived." HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). Wagners' OB does not
 
conform to HRAP Rule 28 nor does it make any comprehensible
 
arguments upon which this court could adequately rule.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the First Amended Final
 
Judgment filed on September 28, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the
 Third Circuit is affirmed.
