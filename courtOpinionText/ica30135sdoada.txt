CALVIN NAKAGAWA, Petitioner-Appellee, v.
PENNI SKATES IRWIN, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 09-1-0007)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Penni Skates Irwin (Irwin), a
 
self-represented party, appeals from the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit's (Circuit Court's) Final Judgment entered on
 
October 7, 2009 (Judgment), which entered judgment in favor of
 Petitioner-Appellee Calvin Nakagawa (Nakagawa) and against
 
Irwin.

On appeal, Irwin raises two points of error: (1) the
 
Circuit Court erred because the clerk of the court could have
 
corrected or noticed the need to correct the filing of a document
 
submitted to the clerk by Irwin, dated February 3, 2009, and
 
entitled "Petition In Praecipe By Declaration In Special
 
Visitation For Mandatory Judicial Of Facts For Petition to
 
Substantive Relief As Reflected In Hawaii Rules of Civil
 
Procedure, Rule 12(b)(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7); Praecipe By

Declaration In Special Visitation For Mandatory Judicial Of Facts
 
In Support Of Petition In Praecipe By Declaration In Special
 
Visitation For Mandatory Judicial Of Facts For Petition to
 
Substantive Relief As Reflected In Hawaii Rules of Civil
 
Procedure, Rule 12(b)(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7); Exhibits "A-B";
 
Notice Of non-Hearing; Certificate Of Service" (Petition in
 
Praecipe), in S.P. 09-00007, rather than in Civil No. 09-1-0007,
 
as appeared on the face of the Petition In Praecipe; and (2) the
 
Circuit Court erred when it failed to conclude that Nakagawa
 
lacked standing to initiate a special proceeding to expunge a
 
nonconsensual lien or encumbrance that Irwin filed against
 
certain property held by Nakagawa.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Irwin's contentions as follows:
 
(1) It appears from the record that Irwin failed to 
file a motion or otherwise request that the court correct his 
filing error. There is nothing in the record to suggest that, at 
any time, Irwin informed the Circuit Court of his inadvertent 
error or mistake. Irwin did not ask the Circuit Court to 
reconsider its ruling on Nakagawa's petition for expungement. 
Although it is attached to his opening brief, the Petition In 
Praecipe is not part of the record on appeal. Appeals must be 
decided on the record before the appellate court. We need not 
consider issues that were not presented and ruled on by the 
Circuit Court. See Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-2; see also 
Royal Kunia Cmty Ass'n v. Nemoto, 119 Hawai 'i 437, 446, 198 P.3d 
700, 709 (App. 2008) ("the rule in this jurisdiction prohibits an 
appellant from complaining for the first time on appeal of error 
to which he has acquiesced or to which he failed to object") 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Paul v. Dep't of 
Transp., 115 Hawai 'i 416, 428, 168 P.3d 546, 558 (2007) ("it is 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
well settled that appellate courts will not consider an issue not
 
raised below unless justice so requires").
 
The Circuit Court did not err in failing to, sua
 
sponte, correct Irwin's filing error.
 
(2) On January 14, 2009, Nakagawa filed a petition for 
order expunging Irwin's nonconsensual common law lien, which lien 
was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances on November 14, 2007 
(Lien). With the petition, Nakagawa submitted a declaration of 
counsel and exhibits establishing that Nakagawa was appointed as 
a foreclosure commissioner who was authorized and directed to 
take possession of and to sell the subject property. The record 
is devoid of any jurisdictional, evidentiary, or substantive 
objection to Nakagawa's petition, and it appears from the Circuit 
Court's March 11, 2009 order that Irwin did not appear at the 
hearing on Nakagawa's petition. The record contains prima facie 
evidence that Nakagawa had the requisite standing, as the 
foreclosure commissioner in the underlying foreclosure action, to 
file the petition to expunge the Lien. See, e.g., HRS § 507D­
4(a); Mottl v. Miyahira, 95 Hawai 'i 381, 389, 23 P.3d 716, 724 
(2001). Therefore, we conclude that the Circuit Court did not 
err when it failed to conclude that Nakagawa lacked standing to 
initiate a special proceeding to expunge the Lien. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's October 7, 2009 
Judgment is affirmed.
