NO. 30148
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ROBIN R. GRANT, Defendant-Appellant
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NOS. 1DTC-07-088262, 1DTC-07-062536,
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
1DTC-08-009885, AND 1DTC-08-038684)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Robin R. Grant ("Grant") appeals
 
from the Judgments, filed on September 28, 2009, in the District
 
1
Court of the First Circuit ("District Court")  in Case Nos. 1DTC­
07-088262, 1DTC-07-062536, 1DTC-08-009885, and 1DTC-08-038684. 
Grant was found guilty of four counts of operating or

 
using a motor vehicle upon a public street, road, or highway of
 
the State while such motor vehicle is uninsured (no motor vehicle 
insurance), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 431:10C-104. 
On appeal, Grant contends that the District Court erred
 
(1) by denying her motion to disqualify the Department of the
 Prosecuting Attorney for the City and County of Honolulu, (2)
 because there was insufficient evidence to convict Grant of
 driving without no-fault insurance, and (3) because there was
 insufficient evidence to convict Grant because the prosecution
 failed to disprove that Grant's vehicle was an "antique motor
 vehicle" under HRS § 431:10C-104(d). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
1 The Honorable Leslie Hayashi presided.
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Grant's points of error as follows:
 
(1) In the opening brief, Grant makes no argument as to 
why the District Court erred by denying her motion to disqualify the Department of the Prosecuting Attorney. In the argument section of her opening brief, Grant merely repeats where in the record the District Court denied her motion. Therefore, the point of error is waived. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7); Int'l Sav. and Loan Ass'n, Ltd. v. Carbonel, 93 Hawai
'i 464, 473, 5 P.3d 
454, 463 (App. 2000) ("An appellate court need not address matters as to which the appellant has failed to present a discernible argument.") 
(2) There was sufficient evidence to convict Grant of 
driving without no-fault insurance under HRS § 431:10C-104(d) in each of the four cases. Each of the officers that issued citations to Grant testified that Grant did not produce an insurance card. "[I]t was the legislature's intent that the trier of fact might infer from the inability to produce an insurance identification card that there was no no-fault insurance coverage of the vehicle or the driver." State v. Lee, 
90 Hawai
'i 130, 135, 976 P.2d 444, 449 (1999). Thus, there was 
substantial evidence to support the district court's decision. 
(3) There was sufficient evidence to convict Grant of 
driving without no-fault insurance despite the prosecution not proving that Grant's vehicle was not an "antique motor vehicle" under HRS § 431:10C-104(d) since Grant did not present any evidence or argument at trial regarding the age or status of her vehicle. Therefore, the State was not required to disprove that Grant's vehicle was an "antique motor vehicle" under HRS § 431:10C-104(d). See State v. Romano, 114 Hawai
'i 1, 6, 155 
P.3d 1102, 1107 (2007) ("'[I]f a statutory exception to an offense constitutes a separate and distinct defense, . . . the State's burden to disprove the defense beyond a reasonable doubt arises only after evidence of the defense is first raised by the defendant.'"). 
Therefore,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Judgments, filed on

 1DTC-08-038684 are affirmed.
