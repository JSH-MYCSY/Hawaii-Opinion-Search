(By: Foley, Presiding J., Leonard, J., and
Circuit Judge Chang in place of Nakamura, C.J.,

Defendant-Appellant Damien Ferreira Jr. (Ferreira)
 
appeals from the Judgments filed in Case Nos. 1P109-03191, 1P109­
03192, 1P109-03193, and 1P109-03194 on September 30, 2009 in the
 
1
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division  (district
court). 
On March 23, 2009, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i 
(State) charged Ferreira with four counts of Wilful Failure to File Return, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 231­35 (2001 Repl.). On July 31, 2009, Ferreira pled no contest to all four counts and moved for deferred acceptances of his no contest pleas. The district court accepted Ferreira's pleas, but

denied his requests for deferred acceptances. The district court
 
sentenced him to, inter alia:
 
On Count I (Case No. 1P109-03191): one year of
 
probation and 50 hours of community service and ordered him to
 pay a fine of $2,000 and restitution in the amount of $30,252;
 
On Count II (Case No. 1P109-03192): one year of
 
concurrent probation and 50 hours of community service and
 ordered him to pay a fine of $2,000 and restitution in the amount
 of $26,642;
 
On Count III (Case No. 1P109-03193): one year of
 
concurrent probation and 50 hours of community service and
 ordered him to pay a fine of $2,000 and restitution in the amount
 of $17,843; and
 
On Count IV (Case No. 1P109-03194): one year of
 
probation and 50 hours of community service and ordered him to
 pay a fine of $2,000 and restitution in the amount of $4,811.
 
On September 30, 2009, the district court entered a
 
"Judgment and Order for Restitution Pursuant to Sections 706-605,
 706-644, and 706-647, H.R.S."
 
On October 29, 2009, Ferreira filed an appeal from the
 
four Judgments.
 
On appeal, Ferriera contends the restitution and fine
 
portions of his sentences were excessive and the district court
 erred in denying his motions for deferred acceptance of his no
 contest pleas.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we vacate and
 remand. 
The district court did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying Ferreira's motions for deferred acceptance of his no
 contest pleas. State v. Tom, 69 Haw. 602, 603, 752 P.2d 597
 
(1988). However, the district court erred in setting the amount
 of restitution Ferreira could afford to pay. State v. Gaylord,

78 Hawai 'i 127, 890 P.2d 1167 (1995). The district court 
mistakenly set restitution pursuant to HRS §§ 706-605 and 706-624 
as amended in 2006. 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230, § 17 at 1007 & § 20 at 1009. Act 230 took effect on June 22, 2006, 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230, § 54 at 1025, and by its own terms did not "affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, or proceedings that were begun, before its effective date." 2006 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 230, § 51 at 1024. Ferreria was charged with failure to file tax returns in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgments filed in Case
 
Nos. 1P109-03191, 1P109-03192, 1P109-03193, and 1P109-03194 on
 September 30, 2009 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division, are vacated and this case is remanded for
 further proceedings as to the amount of restitution Ferreira can
 afford to pay.
