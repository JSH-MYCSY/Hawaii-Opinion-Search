OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
A'OPOHAKUKU R. RODENHURST, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-09-062844)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant A 'oPohakuku R. Rodenhurst 
(Rodenhurst) appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or 
Order and Plea/Judgment filed on October 14, 2009 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).
1 
Rodenhurst was found guilty of Driving Without a License, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 286-102 (2007). 
On appeal, Rodenhurst contends that the District Court 
lacks jurisdiction because she provided a factual and legal basis for concluding that the Kingdom of Hawai
'i exists as a state in 
accordance with recognized attributes of a state's sovereign nature in accordance with State v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai
'i 219, 883 
P.2d 641 (App. 1994), and because she met her burden of proving lack of jurisdiction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Rodenhurst's point of error as follows:

 The Honorable Leslie Hayashi presided.
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The District Court had jurisdiction over the criminal 
matter. H AW. REV. STAT. §§ 603-1 (Supp. 2009), 604-1 (1993), and 
604-8 (Supp. 2009). The State has jurisdiction over all persons 
operating vehicles on the public roadways within Hawai 'i. State 
v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai 'i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 
2004). "Persons claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai
'i and not the State of Hawai 'i are not exempt from the laws 
of the State of Hawai 'i applicable to all persons (citizens and 
non-citizens) operating motor vehicles on public roads and highways within the State of Hawai
'i." Id. This authority does 
not violate Rodenhurst's right to travel or impinge upon her constitutional right to freedom of movement. State v. French, 77 
Hawai
'i 222, 231-32, 883 P.2d 644, 653-54 (App. 1994). 
Rodenhurst did not present a factual and legal basis 
for concluding that the Kingdom of Hawai 'i exists as a state in 
accordance with recognized attributes of a state's sovereign nature. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai
'i at 221, 883 P.2d at 643. Recognized 
attributes include "the power to declare and wage war; to conclude peace; to maintain diplomatic ties with other sovereigns; to acquire territory by discovery and occupation; and to make international agreements and treaties." Id. at 221 n.4, 
883 P.2d at 643 n.4. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment filed on October 14,
 2009, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division, is affirmed.
