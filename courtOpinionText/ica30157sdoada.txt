STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JAMES D. MORAVEC, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NOS. 1DTA-09-03257 & 1DTI-09-104998)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant James D. Moravec (Moravec) appeals
 
from two Notices of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, entered on October 26, 2009, in the District Court
 of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).
1
 
Moravec was found guilty, in Case No. 1DTA-09-03257, of Operating
 a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), in
 violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291E-61(a)(1) and/or
 (a)(3) (Supp. 2009), and in Case No. 1DTI-09-104998, for
 disregarding a stop sign in violation of HRS ยง 291C-63(b) (2007). 
On appeal, Moravec contends that the District Court
 
erred by (1) refusing to dismiss the OVUII charge because it did
 not contain an essential element that the offense was committed
 on a public street, (2) ruling that the State's failure to comply
 with Rule 7(d) of the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure was a mere
 formality and not prejudicial, and that such error deprived the
 District Court of jurisdiction, and (3) admitting sworn
 statements by the intoxilyzer supervisor which violated Moravec's
 right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the United

States Constitution.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties,2 we
 
resolve Moravec's points of error as follows:
 "[T]he operation of a vehicle on a public way, street, 
road, or highway is an attendant circumstance of the offense of OVUII, and is therefore an element of the offense." State v. 
Wheeler
, 121 Hawai 'i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009). The 
failure to allege that Moravec was driving a vehicle upon a public way, street, road, or highway at the time of the offense rendered the charge deficient. Id. As a result, we do not reach 
the issues addressed in Moravec's second and third points of error. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of

 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on October 26,
 2009, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division, in Case No. 1DTA-09-03257 is vacated and the matter is
 remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the
 charge without prejudice.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai

 Although Moravec appeals from the judgment finding him guilty of
disregarding a stop sign, he does not state any points of error or make any
argument in this regard. Therefore, this court will disregard the appeal in Case
No. 1DTI-09-104998. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4).
