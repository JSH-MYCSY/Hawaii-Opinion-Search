STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
PAMELA L. TAYLOR, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0331)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Pamela L. Taylor (Taylor) appeals
 
from the "Judgment of Conviction and Sentence" (Judgment) 
entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
 
1
 on October 7, 2009.   Taylor was convicted of second-
 Court)
degree theft by deception, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) §§ 708-830(2) (1993) and 708-831(1)(b) (Supp.
 2011). The Circuit Court sentenced Taylor to five years of
 incarceration and ordered her to pay $7,000 in restitution. 
On appeal, Taylor argues: (1) the Circuit Court erred
 
in failing to instruct the jury on her mistake-of-fact defense;
 and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support her
 conviction.

We resolve Taylor's arguments on appeal as follows:
 
(1) Based on State v. Stenger, 122 Hawai' i 271, 226 
P.3d 441 (2010), we conclude that the Circuit Court erred in failing to instruct the jury on Taylor's mistake-of-fact defense and that such error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
(2) Taylor's claim that there was insufficient 
evidence to support her conviction is based on her version of the facts. However, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, see State v. Tamura, 63 Haw. 636, 637, 633 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1981), there was sufficient evidence to support Taylor's conviction. See State v. Yamada, 116 Hawai' i 422, 442, 
173 P.3d 569, 589 (App. 2007) ("[O]n appeal, this court will not attempt to reconcile conflicting evidence, or interfere with a jury decision based on the credibility of witnesses or the weight of the evidence." (block quote format and citation omitted); State v. Smith, 106 Hawai' i 365, 372, 105 P.3d 242, 249 (App. 
2004) ("It is the province of the jury, not the appellate courts, to determine the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence."). 
We vacate the Judgment entered by the Circuit Court,
 
and we remand the case for a new trial consistent with this
 Summary Disposition Order on the charge of second-degree theft by
 deception.
