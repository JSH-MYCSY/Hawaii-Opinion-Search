BENJAMIN WALKER, II, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-08-074544)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Benjamin Walker, II (Walker)
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, entered on October 7, 2009 in the District Court
 of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).
1
 
Walker was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105(a)(1) and/or (a)(2)
 (2007).
 
On appeal, Walker contends that (1) the District Court 
erred by denying his motion in limine because the State failed to adduce the requisite foundation for admissibility of the speed check card, as required by State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai
'i 354, 
227 P.3d 520 (2010), (2) admission of the speed check card into evidence violated his right to confrontation, and (3) there was insufficient evidence to convict him of Excessive Speeding. 
The State admits that there was insufficient foundation
 
to admit the speed check card into evidence under Fitzwater, and,

therefore, insufficient evidence to convict Walker of Excessive
 
Speeding without the speedometer reading. The State argues,
 however, that the case should be remanded to the District Court
 for entry of a judgment against Walker for violating HRS § 291C­102(a)(1), a non-criminal traffic violation of speeding. The
 State points to Officer Grems's testimony that "I observed a set
 of headlights approaching from the rear at a high rate of speed
 and the vehicle passed me and I accelerated and began pacing[,]"
 and "I accelerated to match that vehicle's speed[,]" as evidence
 to support a finding that Walker was speeding.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Walker's points of error as follows:
 
The State failed to establish how and when the speed 
check was performed, including whether it was performed in the manner specified by the manufacturer of the equipment used to perform the check, and the identity and qualifications of the person performing the check. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai
'i at 376-77, 
227 P.3d at 542-43. Therefore, there was insufficient foundation to admit the speed check card into evidence. Without admission of the speed check card into evidence, there was insufficient evidence to convict Walker of Excessive Speeding. As a result, we need not address Walker's other point of error. 
There was also insufficient evidence to find that
 
Walker was speeding. Unlike Fitzwater, Walker did not admit to
 driving at any speed because he did not testify. Officer Grems's
 testimony that he observed Walker's vehicle coming up from the
 rear at a high rate of speed, pass him by, and that he had to
 accelerate to match Walker's speed is not sufficient evidence to
 conclude that Walker was driving at any specific speed. 
Therefore, there was insufficient evidence to find that Walker
 was speeding.

Therefore,

 Division, is reversed.
