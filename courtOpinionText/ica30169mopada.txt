CATINA LOUISE BEAM, n/k/a CATINA STEFANIK,
Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
BRUCE WOODFORD BEAM, Defendant-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(FC-D NO. 07-1-0232)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley and Ginoza, JJ. with
Nakamura, C.J. dissenting separately)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Catina L. Beam, now known as

 
Catina L. Stefanik (Stefanik or Mother) appeals from the
 
October 13, 2009 "Order Re: 1) Defendant's Motion and Affidavit
 
for Post-Decree Relief, filed on August 1, 2008; and
 
2) Plaintiff's Motion For Unsupervised Visitation, filed on
 
July 27, 2009" (October 13, 2009 Order) entered by the Family
 
Court of the First Circuit (family court).1
 
On appeal, Stefanik raises nine points of error,
 
summarized as follows:
 
(1) The family court did not have "exclusive and
 
continuing" jurisdiction when Defendant-Appellee Bruce W. Beam
 
(Beam or Father) filed his Motion and Affidavit for Post-Decree

Relief on August 1, 2008, and instead Texas had jurisdiction as
 
the children's "home state";
 
(2) The family court erred in appointing Dr. Marvin
 
Acklin as an evaluator and allowing his continued involvement in
 
the case;2
 
(3) The family court erred in denying Stefanik's Motion
 
to Dismiss and Terminate Jurisdiction filed on April 22, 2009;3
 
(4) The family court erred in denying Stefanik's
 
Alternate Motion to Dismiss and Terminate Jurisdiction filed on
 
June 23, 2009;4
 
(5) The family court erred in granting Beam's Motion in
 
Limine filed on August 18, 2009, which precluded Mother from,
 
among other things, introducing at trial any evidence of facts or
 
circumstances prior to August 25, 2008;5
 
(6) The family court erred in denying Stefanik's Motion
 
for Leave to Present Testimony of Dr. Robert Geffner filed on
 
July 23, 2009;
 
(7) The family court erred in denying Stefanik's Motion
 
for Testimony of Child, filed on July 30, 2009, pursuant to which
 
she sought to have her oldest daughter, then almost 13 years old,
 
testify regarding in which household daughter would prefer to
 
live;

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(9) The family court violated Stefanik's civil rights
 
by, among other things, denying her visitation with her children
 
and limiting the manner of her communication with them.
 
Based upon a careful review of the record and the
 
briefs submitted by the parties, having given due consideration
 
to the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties,
 
and for the reasons set forth below, we affirm the family court's
 
October 13, 2009 Order.
 
I. Jurisdictional Issues – Points of Error One and Three
 
Whether the family court properly exercised 
jurisdiction is a question of law which we review de novo. In re 
Doe, 96 Hawai 'i 272, 283, 30 P.3d 878, 889 (2001). 
For purposes of the jurisdictional analysis, the
 
following dates and facts are relevant. Stefanik initiated this
 
action on January 22, 2007 when she filed her complaint for
 
divorce. On February 23, 2007, the family court issued the
 
Decree Granting Absolute Divorce and Awarding Child Custody
 
(Divorce Decree), which awarded legal custody jointly to both
 
parties and awarded primary physical custody to Stefanik subject
 
to Beam's right of reasonable visitation. On March 3, 2007,
 
Stefanik and the children relocated to Texas. Between June and
 
September 2007, motions and an order were filed regarding post-
decree issues and jurisdiction, with the family court retaining
 
jurisdiction. 
On August 1, 2008, Beam filed a second motion for post-
decree relief seeking, among other things, sole legal and
 
physical custody. On August 25, 2008 and October 24, 2008, the
 
family court issued orders regarding Beam's motion for post-
decree relief, including an award of temporary sole legal and
 
physical custody to Beam until further order of the court and
 
ordering Beam not to relocate until trial on the merits scheduled
 
for January 12, 2009. After an initial continuance of trial, the
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
court issued an order on March 19, 2009 which further continued 
the trial, retained jurisdiction, and allowed Beam and the 
children to relocate to Louisiana.6 On April 15, 2009, Beam and 
the children relocated to Louisiana. On April 22, 2009, Stefanik filed a Motion to Dismiss and Terminate Jurisdiction, asserting 
the family court did not have jurisdiction because both parties 
and the children no longer resided in Hawai
'i. On June 23, 2009, 
Stefanik filed an Alternate Motion to Dismiss and Terminate jurisdiction, asserting that Hawai
'i was an inconvenient forum. 
On August 13, 2009, the family court issued an order denying Stefanik's motion to dismiss and her alternate motion to dismiss. 
Trial was held on September 14 and 15, 2009. On October 13, 
2009, the family court issued the order from which Stefanik now 
appeals, which addresses Beam's August 1, 2008 motion for post-
decree relief and a motion filed by Stefanik which sought 
unsupervised visitation. 
With regard to Stefanik's first and third points of
 
error, the family court properly exercised jurisdiction both
 
before and after Beam and the children relocated to Louisiana. 
The requirements for the family court's exclusive and continuing
 
jurisdiction of a child custody determination are set out in
 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 583A-202 (2006 Repl.), which
 
provides:
 
(a) Except as otherwise provided in section 583A-204,
a court of this State which has made a child-custody
determination consistent with section 583A-201 or 583A-203
 has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the
determination until:
 
(1)	 A court of this State determines that the child,
the child's parents, and any person acting as a
parent do not have a significant connection with
this State and that substantial evidence is no
 longer available in this State concerning the
child's care, protection, training, and personal
relationships; or
 
6
 Beam is in the military and his relocation was pursuant to military
orders.
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2)	 A court of this State or a court of another
 
state determines that the child, the child's
parents, and any person acting as a parent do
not presently reside in this State.
(b) A court of this State which has made a
 
child-custody determination and does not have exclusive,
continuing jurisdiction under this section may modify that
determination only if it has jurisdiction to make an initial
determination under section 583A-201.
 
(emphasis added).
 
There is no dispute that, consistent with HRS § 583A­
201 (2006 Repl.), the family court had jurisdiction to issue the 
initial child custody determination contained in the Divorce 
Decree entered on February 23, 2007. As of August 1, 2008, when 
Beam filed his second motion for post-decree relief, although 
Stefanik and the children had relocated to Texas, Beam still 
resided in Hawai 'i. Therefore, under the express terms of 
HRS § 583A-202, the family court maintained exclusive and continuing jurisdiction at that point. 
Even after Beam was allowed by court order to relocate
 
to Louisiana with the children in April 2009, the family court
 
properly maintained exclusive and continuing jurisdiction. The
 
modification proceedings initiated by Beam's August 1, 2008
 
motion for post-decree relief were still ongoing and pending when
 
he and the children moved out-of-state. By way of the orders in
 
August and October of 2008, the family court had awarded
 
temporary legal and physical custody to Beam, and had, inter
 
alia, ordered that a custody evaluator be appointed pending a
 
trial on the merits. Although trial was initially scheduled for
 
a few months later, several continuances thereafter ensued and
 
Beam and the children were allowed to relocate.
 
5
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The comments to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction
 
and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) (1997) provide clear guidance on
 
this issue.7 As stated in the comment to § 202 of the UCCJEA:
 
Jurisdiction attaches at the commencement of a
 
proceeding. If State A had jurisdiction under this section
at the time a modification proceeding was commenced there,
it would not be lost by all parties moving out of the State
prior to the conclusion of proceeding. State B would not
 have jurisdiction to hear a modification unless State A
decided that State B was more appropriate under Section 207.
 
(emphasis added). See also Bullard v. Bullard, 3 Haw. App. 194,
 
200, 647 P.2d 294, 299 (1982) (citation omitted) (stating that
 
"[s]ubject matter jurisdiction in a custody case is determined as
 
of the time the petition is filed.").8 Therefore, even after
 
Beam and the children moved out-of-state in April 2009, the
 family court maintained exclusive and continuing jurisdiction
 
under HRS § 583A-202. 
II. Stefanik's Claim of Inconvenient Forum –- Point of Error
 
Four
 
With regard to Stefanik's fourth point of error, that
 
the family court was an inconvenient forum and should have
 
declined jurisdiction under HRS § 583A-207 (2006 Repl.), we
 
review this issue for abuse of discretion.
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion in
making its decisions and those decision will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
[an appellate court] will not disturb the family court's
decisions on appeal unless the family court disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant and its decision clearly
exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
7
 The Hawai' i Legislature promulgated HRS Chapter 583A in 2002, thereby
enacting the UCCJEA.
8
 Bullard addressed the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA),
 
which was replaced by the UCCJEA. However, the timing for determining
jurisdiction is consistent for purposes of the facts in the instant case.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai 'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai 'i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). 
As the family court found in its August 13, 2009 order 
denying Stefanik's Alternate Motion to Dismiss, after Stefanik 
initiated the case in Hawai 'i and the Divorce Decree was issued, 
"there ha[d] been extensive post-divorce litigation in this jurisdiction," a custody evaluator was appointed in furtherance 
of the Hawai
'i proceedings, and the trial was ordered to take 
place in Hawai 'i before Beam and the children were allowed to 
relocate. Given these circumstances, the record in this case, 
and considering the factors in HRS § 583A-207, we conclude that 
the family court did not abuse its discretion in denying the 
Alternate Motion to Dismiss. 
III. Dr. Acklin –- Point of Error Two
 
Stefanik argues that the family court "erred in
 
allowing Dr. Acklin, already under Defendant's employment, to be
 
appointed and erred again by taking no action to remedy the
 
situation when Plaintiff made Judge Browning aware of
 
Dr. Acklin's conflicts of interest in December 2008." Stefanik
 
asserts that it was not revealed by Beam or the family court that
 
Dr. Acklin was "employed" by Beam, and that Dr. Acklin's
 
appointment violated the American Psychological Association (APA)
 
Ethics Code 3.06 (Conflicts of Interest). Stefanik's assertions
 
are not supported in the record and are unpersuasive.
 
Father proposed to have Dr. Acklin appointed as Case
 
Manager/Special Master pursuant to HRS § 571-46(a)(5) (Supp
 
9
2009). In a declaration to the court, prior to Dr. Acklin's
9
 HRS § 571-46(a)(5) provided authority for the appointment, as
follows:
 
(a) In actions for divorce, separation, annulment,
separate maintenance, or any other proceedings where there
(continued...)
 
7
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appointment, Beam's counsel disclosed that he had consulted
 
Dr. Acklin on May 6, 2008, with his client present, to inquire
 
about Dr. Acklin assuming the role of Case Manager/Special
 
Master. Beam's counsel further stated that his client had no
 
meaningful participation in that meeting and that Dr. Acklin
 
tentatively agreed to serve in those roles. Thus, there is
 
nothing in the record to support Stefanik's assertion that Beam
 
had employed Dr. Acklin and, moreover, Beam's contact with
 
Dr. Acklin was disclosed.
 
After a hearing on August 13, 2008, the family court
 
issued an order on August 25, 2008, which stated that the parties
 
had agreed to appoint Dr. Acklin.  This order was "approved as to
 
form" by Stefanik's then-counsel, Cheryl R. Brawley. Thus,
 
Stefanik did not object to Dr. Acklin's appointment and indeed
 
consented to his appointment. The family court did not abuse its
 
discretion in appointing Dr. Acklin.
 
Stefanik also argues that the family court reversibly
 
erred in denying her motion in limine, which sought to have the
 
family court "disregard and exclude any and all past and future
 
9(...continued)
is at issue a dispute as to the custody of a minor child,
the court, during the pendency of the action, at the final
hearing, or any time during the minority of the child, may
make an order for the custody of the minor child as may seem
necessary or proper. In awarding the custody, the court
shall be guided by the following standards, considerations,
and procedures:
 
* * * *
  
(5)
	 The court may hear the testimony of any person or
expert, produced by any party or upon the court's own
motion, whose skill, insight, knowledge, or experience
is such that the person's or expert's testimony is
relevant to a just and reasonable determination of
what is for the best physical, mental, moral, and
spiritual well-being of the child whose custody is at
issue[.]
 
8
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
testimony from Dr. Marvin Acklin, and any and all testimony
 
positing that this is a case of 'parental alienation syndrome' or
 
'parental alienation.'" Following a hearing on the motion in
 
limine, the court granted in part and denied in part Stefanik's
 
motion, limiting Dr. Acklin's testimony to "the facts and
 
circumstances which arose or occurred after August 25, 2008" and
 
denying the motion in all other respects. Dr. Acklin testified
 
at the trial on September 14, 2009, properly limited the scope of
 
his testimony to events after August 25, 2008, and did not
 
discuss the theories that Stefanik hoped to exclude.
 
Based on our review of the record, the family court did
 
not abuse its discretion in allowing Dr. Acklin to testify at
 
trial.
 
IV.	 Limitation of Evidence At Trial –- Points of Error Five
 
Through Eight
 
The family court has broad discretion to determine 
appropriate evidence for trial, and this court reviews such 
rulings under the abuse of discretion standard. See Miyamoto v. 
Lum, 104 Hawai 'i 1, 7, 84 P.3d 509, 515 (2004) (granting or 
denying a motion in limine is reviewed for abuse of discretion); 
see also Fisher, 111 Hawai 'i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360 (noting that 
generally, the family court has broad discretion). 
Stefanik's points of error five through eight all
 
address motions regarding the type of evidence to be presented at
 the trial. Each of the motions involved in these points of error 
were addressed at a hearing before the family court on August 25,
 
2009. The transcript from this hearing has not been made part of
 
the record on appeal. Moreover, transcripts from previous
 
hearings, including the hearings on August 13, 2008 and
 
August 25, 2008, also have not been included in the record on
 
appeal. The only transcripts in the record on appeal are for the
 
trial dates on September 14-15, 2009. Pursuant to Rule
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
10(b)(1)(A) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), 
Stefanik, as the appellant, was required to request transcripts 
for any points on appeal that require consideration of the oral 
proceedings below. 
With regard to points of error five through eight, for
 
the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the family court
 
did not abuse its discretion.
 
A. Beam's Motion In Limine
 Beam filed a motion in limine to limit the trial
 
evidence to facts after August 25, 2008, the date of the last
 hearing on Beam's second motion for post-decree relief and which
 
resulted in the family court's order of temporary custody for
 
Beam. The family court's order granting Beam's motion in limine,
 
which was issued on September 11, 2009, stated in pertinent part:
 
2. The evidence which may be adduced by either
party is limited and restricted only to the facts and
circumstances which may have arisen after August 25, 2008;
 
3. Each party is barred from re-litigating any
claims or issues previously litigated and/or decided,
including Mother's claims of sexual abuse or sexually
inappropriate behavior by Defendant prior to August 25,
2008, and Mother's claims that Father was responsible for
the breakdown of his relationship with [daughter];
 
4. The Order filed herein on October 24, 2008 by
the [family court] is determined to be conclusive as to all
claims which existed prior to such date, including claims
that:
 
(a) There was a material change of circumstances
since the entry of the Divorce Decree entered herein
on February 23, 2007; 
(b) Plaintiff, and persons associated with her, have
failed to facilitate a positive and harmonious
relationship between the children and Father; and 
(c) It is in the best interests of the children that
 
temporary legal and physical custody of the minor
children be awarded to Father.
 
(emphasis added).
 
At the time the family court issued its ruling on
 
Beam's motion in limine, there had been multiple filings and at
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
least four hearings on the question of the children's custody. 
The family court was thus already familiar with the circumstances
 
of the parties due to the ongoing custody litigation, and a
 
determination on the best interests of the children had been made
 
based on evidence provided up to August 25, 2008. Moreover,
 
without relevant transcripts in the record on appeal, Stefanik
 
cannot meet her burden of demonstrating error by the family
 
court.
 
Custody was first addressed in the February 23, 2007
 
Divorce Decree. Before the Divorce Decree was issued, a hearing
 
was held on February 12, 2007.
 
The family court again addressed the question of
 
custody after Beam filed his first motion for post-decree relief
 
on June 26, 2007, in which he sought physical custody of the
 
children. In this motion, Beam alleged, among other things: that
 
Stefanik was attempting to alienate the children from him in
 
numerous ways including precluding or limiting the children from
 
speaking with him by phone; that she had denied his visitation
 
with the children earlier that month (mid-June 2007) when he went
 
to Texas to pick them up, but Stefanik had taken them out of the
 
state; and that Stefanik had made false reports about him to 
Texas Child Protective Services. In response, Stefanik filed her
 
first motion seeking to change jurisdiction to Texas. Beam, in
 
turn, submitted findings dated August 2, 2007 by the Texas
 
Department of Family and Protective Services that they had "ruled
 
out" allegations that he had sexually abused the children. Both
 
Beam's motion and Stefanik's jurisdictional motion were heard on
 
August 22, 2007. Along with maintaining jurisdiction, the family
 
court did not change custody but partially granted Beam's motion
 
for post-decree relief, ordering that: "[t]he parties shall
 
comply with the specific wording of the Decree regarding
 
visitation" and that "[t]he parties shall communicate by email
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
only (telephone contacts between the children & Father will
 
continue)."
 
On August 1, 2008, Beam filed his second motion for
 
post-decree relief, alleging multiple concerns, including that:
 his eldest child in particular was being alienated from him; that
 
there were recent significant incidents in his efforts to pick up
 
the children for their summer visit with him (including that,
 
after receiving a call from Stefanik, the eldest child acted out
 
on an airplane to such a degree that the flight had to be
 
delayed); and that despite the family court's prior ruling there
 
were still chronic violations of his visitation rights. Beam
 
requested, inter alia, a psychological evaluation of the children
 
and that he be awarded physical custody of the children. Two
 
hearings were set and held, first on August 13, 2008 and then
 
August 25, 2008. According to orders issued on August 25, 2008
 
and October 24, 2008, both parties were present at each hearing
 
with their respective counsel, and the family court considered
 
the testimony of the parties, as well as pleadings and exhibits
 
submitted by them. As previously noted, the transcripts from the
 
August 13, 2008 and August 25, 2008 hearings were not made part
 
of the record on appeal.
 
As a result of the proceedings in August 2008, the
 
family court awarded temporary physical custody to Beam. In the
 
October 24, 2008 order, the family court made the following
 
findings:
 
The Court finds that there has been a material change
of circumstances since the entry of the Divorce Decree
entered herein on February 23, 2008. The circumstances at
 the time of the entry of the Decree were that both parties
agreed to facilitate positive and harmonious relationships
between the children and the other parent. Since that date,
Plaintiff, and other persons associated with her, have
failed to facilitate a positive and harmonious relationship
with Father.
 
The Court finds that it is in the best interests of
 
the children that temporary legal and physical custody of
the minor children be awarded to Father, and that the
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
children's best interests are further served by appropriate
further orders, set forth below, governing visitation,
communication, evaluations, and procedures.
 
(emphasis added).
 
Stefanik does not challenge on appeal the findings in 
the October 24, 2008 order and therefore those findings are 
binding on this court. Okada Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water 
Supply, 97 Hawai 'i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002); Taylor-Rice 
v. State, 91 Hawai 'i 60, 65, 979 P.2d 1086, 1091 (1999). 
We review the family court's grant of Beam's motion in
 
limine under the abuse of discretion standard, under which we
 
"will not disturb the family court's decisions on appeal unless
 
the family court disregarded rules or principles of law or
 
practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant and its
 
decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason." Fisher, 111
 
Hawai'i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360. 
Moreover, and importantly, 
"The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show error by
reference to matters in the record, and he [or she] has the
responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." Union Building Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw.App.146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984) (citing State v. Goers, 61
Haw. 198, 600 P.2d 1142 (1979); 9 Moore's Federal Practice ¶210.05[1] (2d ed. 1983)). "The law is clear in thisjurisdiction that the appellant has the burden of furnishingthe appellate court with a sufficient record to positively
show the alleged error." Id. (citing State v. Hawaiian Dredging Co., 48 Haw. 152, 397 P.2d 593 (1964); Marn v. Reynolds, 44 Haw. 655, 361 P.2d 383 (1961); Johnson v. Robert's Hawaii Tour, Inc., 4 Haw.App. 175, 664 P.2d 262(1983); Hawaiian Trust Co. v. Cowan, 4 Haw.App. 166, 663
P.2d 634 (1983)); see also Lepere v. United Public Workers 
646, 77 Hawai' i 471, 887 P.2d 1029 (1995) (appellant has
duty to include relevant transcripts of proceedings as part
of record on appeal); Loui v. Board of Medical Examiners, 78
Hawai'i 21, 29 n. 17, 889 P.2d 705, 713 n. 17 (1995) (party
has duty to provide appellate court with transcripts). 
Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai 'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 
558 (1995). Without the transcripts from the relevant hearings, 
we are left to guess as to the extent of evidence provided to the 
family court during those proceedings and Stefanik cannot 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
establish what evidence the family court already had, or did not
 
have, before it –- for instance, the extent of the evidence
 
already provided to the family court on the issue of custody in
 
the hearings on February 12, 2007, August 22, 2007, August 13,
 
2008, and August 25, 2008. Stefanik thus fails to meet her
 
burden as appellant to furnish this court with a sufficient
 
record to show the alleged error.
 
Given the circumstances and the record available in
 
this appeal, we conclude that the family court did not abuse its
 
discretion in limiting evidence at the trial to facts after
 
August 25, 2008, the point up to which the family court had
 
already heard evidence and decided the best interests of the
 
children.
 
Further, to the extent Stefanik argues that she was not
 
given a sufficient opportunity to address the claims raised by
 
Beam in his August 1, 2008 motion for post-decree relief prior to
 
the orders issued on August 25, 2008 and October 24, 2008, the
 
record indicates otherwise. Before the initial orders amending
 
custody were issued, the two hearings on August 13, 2008 and
 
August 25, 2008 were held, at which point both parties appeared
 
and testified. We conclude that the family court provided
 
adequate opportunity for Stefanik to be heard prior to the orders
 
being issued on August 25, 2008 and October 24, 2008.
 
B. Stefanik's Motion To Present Testimony Of Dr. Geffner
 Stefanik wished to call Dr. Geffner as an expert
 
witness at trial but because of his schedule, requested that she
 be allowed to present his testimony by deposition, telephone,
 
testimony, audio-visually, or by other electronic means.
 
There is no direct order in the record memorializing
 
the court's denial of Stefanik's motion. However, the record on
 
appeal contains the findings of fact and conclusions of law
 
14
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
submitted by the family court on January 11, 2010, stating in
 
relevant part:
 
On August 25, 2009, the following seven (7) motions
were heard: . . . Mother's Motion for Leave to Present
 
Testimony of Dr. Robert Geffner Pursuant to Hawaii Revised
Statutes ("HRS") Section 583A-111, filed on July 23, 2009.
The ruling on the motion was reserved, pending the Court's
receipt and review of the report of Dr. Geffner. A further
 hearing was held on September 11, 2009; the motion was
denied.
 
Because the record on appeal does not contain the 
transcript of the August 25, 2009 hearing or the September 11, 
2009 hearing, this court cannot find error in the family court's 
denial. See Bettencourt, 80 Hawai 'i at 230, 909 P.2d at 558. 
Stefanik has failed to establish a sufficient record to show any alleged error. 
C. Stefanik's Motion For Testimony of a Child
 Stefanik argues that the family court erred in not
 
allowing her eldest daughter to testify "as to which household
 she would prefer to live in." After a hearing on August 25,
 
2009, the court denied Stefanik's Motion for Testimony of a
 
Child, finding "that an appearance by the minor child . . . in
 
connection with these proceedings, whether in open court, or in
 
chambers, would not be in her best interests."
 
Stefanik cites to HRS § 571-46(a)(3) to argue that a 
denial of her motion to have her eldest daughter testify was 
tantamount to the court giving "no weight to the children's 
wishes with regards to custody in direct violation of the Hawai
'i 
Revised Statutes." HRS § 571-46(a)(3) (Supp. 2009) provides: 
(a) In actions for divorce, separation, annulment,
separate maintenance, or any other proceedings where there
is at issue a dispute as to the custody of a minor child,
the court, during the pendency of the action, at the final
hearing, or any time during the minority of the child, may
make an order for the custody of the minor child as may seem
 necessary or proper. In awarding the custody, the court
shall be guided by the following standards, considerations,
and procedures:
 
. . . 
15
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(3)	 If a child is of sufficient age and
capacity to reason, so as to form an
intelligent preference, the child's
wishes as to custody shall be
considered and be given due weight
by the court[.]
 
The parties' eldest daughter was not required to
 
testify in order for the family court to consider and give "due
 
weight" to her wishes. There was evidence regarding this issue
 
from Custody Evaluator Janice Wolf in her report to the court and
 
during Wolf's testimony at trial on September 14, 2009.
 
As provided in Rule 45.1 of the Hawai 'i Family Court 
Rules (HFCR), "[p]rior approval must be obtained from the court 
before any child is summoned to appear as a witness so that the 
court may determine whether to allow the testimony of the child 
and the form and manner in which the child's testimony will be 
permitted . . ." HFCR Rule 45.1 (2009). 
The decision whether to permit the child's testimony 
was within the discretion of the family court, and we conclude
 
the family court did not abuse its discretion.
 
D.	 Stefanik's Motion To Procure Out-of-State Witnesses and
 
Evidence
 
Stefanik next argues that the family court erred in
 
denying her "Motion to Procure Out of State Witnesses and
 
Evidence pursuant to HRS § 583-111 and 583-112(a)" (Motion to
 
Procure), thereby denying her a fair and equitable trial.
 
In the motion, Stefanik requested that "if, in fact,
 
the [c]ourt proceeds to trial over [her] jurisdictional
 
objections," that the family court request the Texas court: 
to hold an evidentiary hearing to take evidence from the
relevant and material witnesses set forth in Exhibit A (all
persons having direct knowledge of facts necessary for
adjudication of the children's best interest) living in or
near the jurisdiction of said Texas court, and to forward to
this [c]ourt a certified transcript of the record of the hearing
and the evidence otherwise presented.
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Attached to the motion as an addendum was a list of twenty-six
 
relatives, eighty-one family friends, and fifteen other
 
individuals whom Stefanik asserted lived in or near the
 
jurisdiction of the Texas court and who were "expected to testify
 
in this case." Stefanik's memorandum in support of the motion
 
listed additional witnesses who had been involved in her report
 
of sexual abuse by Beam. Her memorandum states that all the
 
witnesses were expected to address Beam's allegations against
 
Stefanik that led to the temporary custody award to him. 
Stefanik asserted that all of the witnesses listed "possess
 
direct knowledge of facts relevant to the children's custody and
 
best interest, to Defendant's allegations, Dr. Acklin's
 
assumptions and theories, and to Plaintiff's interaction and
 
relationship with the children."
 
The order denying Stefanik's Motion to Procure
 
explained why the motion was being denied:
 
In light of the [c]ourt's rulings on Defendant's Motion in
Limine, prior to the hearing on Motion to Procure . . .
pursuant to which rulings, inter alia, the [c]ourt limited
and restricted evidence which may be adduced by either party
only to facts and circumstances which may have arisen after
August 25, 2008, and based upon the fact that all of the
witnesses sought to be called by Plaintiff pursuant to said
Motion to Procure . . . could only provide testimony which
would be barred by the rulings on Defendant's Motion in
Limine, Plaintiff's above-referenced Motion is denied.
 
Given the excessive nature of Stefanik's motion seeking
 
to have a total of one-hundred and twenty-two witnesses testify
 
in an evidentiary hearing in Texas, the lack of the transcript
 
from the August 25, 2009 hearing to assess any other proffer made
 
by Stefanik for the need of these witnesses, and that the family
 
court had limited both parties to facts after August 25, 2008, we
 
conclude the family court did not abuse its discretion in denying
 
this motion.
 
17
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
V. Alleged Violation of Civil Rights
 
Stefanik's last argument is that her civil rights were
 
violated when the court "ignored its inherent supervisory role in
 
custody matters and violated [her] fundamental rights to a
 
relationship with her children."
 
On appeal, this court answers questions of 
constitutional law "by exercising our own independent judgment 
based on the facts of the case. Thus, we review questions of 
constitutional law under the right/wrong standard." Doe v. Doe, 
120 Hawai 'i 149, 165, 202 P.3d 610, 626 (App. 2009) (quoting 
State v. Fields, 115 Hawai 'i 503, 511, 168 P.3d 955, 963 (2007)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
There is no question that Stefanik, as a mother, "had a 
fundamental liberty interest in her right of care, custody, and control" of her children. Doe v. Doe, 120 Hawai
'i at 168, 202 
P.3d at 629. 
[U]nder the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States
Constitution and article 1, section 5 of the Hawai' i 
Constitution, the State may not deprive her of this interestwithout providing a fair procedure for deprivation. 'At its core, procedural due process of law requires notice and anopportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in ameaningful manner before governmental deprivation of asignificant liberty interest.' 
(internal citations omitted). 
Here, the family court held two hearings before it
 
issued orders temporarily modifying the child-custody
 
determination in August 2008. Thereafter, there were numerous
 
motions, hearings, settlement conferences, and a two-day trial. 
Throughout these extensive proceedings, Stefanik had notice and
 
fully and vigorously participated. On appeal, she fails to make
 
a showing that her civil rights have been compromised.

Visitation, filed on July 27, 2009" entered on October 13, 2009.
