NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
NO. 30169
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
CATINA LOUISE BEAM, n/k/a CATINA STEFANIK,
Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
BRUCE WOODFORD BEAM, Defendant-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 07-1-0232)
 
ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
 
(By: Foley and Ginoza, JJ.;

and Nakamura, C.J., dissenting)
 
Upon consideration of the Motion For Reconsideration
 
filed on November 24, 2010 by Catina L. Beam, now known as
 
Catina L. Stefanik (Stefanik) and the records and files herein,
 
it appears that there is no basis on which to grant the motion. 
Stefanik argues that this court dismissed her argument
 
without proper consideration and alleges that she:
 
requested transcripts for all proceedings related to
this case, and is now being held responsible for the
Family Court's failure to provide the same.
Plaintiff's request for transcripts is part of the
judicial record, and Judge Ching's approval of waiving
the fees for these transcripts is also part of the
judicial record. (emphasis added).
 
Stefanik is incorrect in her assertions. 
As referenced in the Memorandum Opinion issued on
 
November 15, 2010, the record on appeal establishes that Stefanik
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
made a transcript request only for the trial dates of
 
September 14 and 15, 2009. These transcripts were made a part of
 
the record on appeal. However, no other transcript request was
 
filed with the family court and no other transcripts were made a
 
part of the record on appeal. This court cannot consider the
 
transcripts Stefanik now attaches to her Motion for
 
Reconsideration.
 
Furthermore, this court did not overlook or
 
misapprehend any of Stefanik's contentions regarding the
 
jurisdiction of the family court or any other asserted point of
 
error.
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
 
reconsideration is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, December 23, 2010.
