BACKGROUND
 
The facts in this case are largely undisputed. On 
July 30, 2003, Defendants purchased real property (Eckerle 
Property) designated on the tax maps of the Third Tax Division, 
State of Hawaii, as Tax Map Key (3)7-3-002-022, from Emma Jane 
Kapehe (Kapehe). Plaintiffs are owners of various lots located 
makai of the Eckerle Property in a subdivision known as Ka' u'ilani 
Estates. 
When Defendants purchased the property from Kapehe, it
 
enjoyed a Grant of Access Easement and First Right of Refusal
 (Easement) over Plaintiffs' properties. The Easement was
 
recorded on August 23, 2002.
3 The Easement read, in part, "The
 
rights herein granted are given solely for access to and from the
 one single family residence located on the real property
 
described in Exhibit C attached hereto (and not for any
 
commercial, agricultural, multi-family or other uses of such real
 
property) as herein described . . . ." The Easement also
 
specified that
 
1
 The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided. 
2
 Defendants' appeal from the October 20. 2009 judgment was
dismissed by this court on September 28, 2010.

 Alternative access to the Eckerle Property exists.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[t]he term of this Grant shall commence upon the recording
of this Grant in the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of
Hawaii and shall continue until the earlier to occur of (i)
the Grantee's breach of any covenant condition or agreement
contained herein and on the part of the Grantee to be
observed and performed, which such breach the Grantee shall
not have cured within thirty (30) days of the receipt of a
written notice from Grantor of such breach; or (ii) the
Grantee's use of the real property described in Exhibit C
attached hereto for any purposes other than one single
family residence.
 
The Easement allowed Defendants to access a road that runs 
through the Ka' u'ilani Estates subdivision to the Eckerle 
Property. There was a gate at the base of the Easement access road which had been in place since the first homes in the 
subdivision were built. Plaintiffs possessed keys to unlock the 
gate, while Defendants did not.
4 Plaintiffs locked the gate to 
prevent access to Defendants, their guests, or other visitors. Rocks were also placed on the south side of the gate by one of 
the Plaintiffs to prevent vehicles from driving around the gate. 
After their purchase, Defendants grubbed and graded the
 
Eckerle Property to start a coffee farm. They planted
 
approximately 15,000 coffee trees on the Eckerle Property in grow
 
bags or otherwise.
 
Plaintiff Carla E. Lauster (Lauster) wanted to
 
terminate the easement because of traffic to and the noise and
 
smoke from the Eckerle Property. Other Plaintiffs were bothered
 
by the smoke from burning fires and noise, including noise from
 
generators, coming from the Eckerle Property and did not like the
 
traffic to the Eckerle Property, or the amount or quality of the
 
visitors to the Eckerle Property. Lauster kept a dated journal
 
of people she saw using the Easement to get to the Eckerle
 
Property as well as other activities on the Eckerle Property.
 
Plaintiffs met several times to discuss the Defendants 
and what action, if any, to take against them. Defendants 
received a letter dated February 28, 2008, signed by persons 
calling themselves "homeowners of the Ka' u'ilani Estates," some of 
4
 Kapehe did not receive keys to the lock on the gate.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
whom were the Plaintiffs, but with no printed names, illegible
 
signatures, and no contact information. The letter accused
 
Defendants of violating the conditions of the Easement and gave
 
Defendants 30 days to "immediately cancel all pending and
 
approved permits pertaining to the above stated [farm] plan and
 
property, and to cease any and all ongoing operations, or
 
permanently and legally surrender your access easement rights
 
through our subdivision, as provided for by the GRANT."
 
From approximately 2004 to the time of trial in 2009,
 
Plaintiffs took hundreds of photographs of Defendants, their
 
property, and any visitors to the Eckerle Property. The pictures
 
were taken from various vantage points around the Eckerle
 
Property, including overhead aerial photographs. Plaintiffs
 
stopped and blocked vehicles coming and going to the Eckerle
 
Property along the Easement access road. Plaintiffs Michael
 
Trevithick and Archie Cox entered the Eckerle Property without
 
permission.
 
Robert Romer (Romer) visited the Eckerle Property and 
was interested in purchasing it. On one occasion, he encountered 
people blocking the Easement access road and another time he was 
"hollered" at by people as he drove on this road. Romer informed 
Defendants that he did not wish to purchase the Eckerle Property 
because he did not want to own property near the Ka' u'ilani 
Estates after those incidents. 
Workers from the Department of Water Supply went to the
 
Eckerle Property to install a water meter and encountered Lauster
 and Plaintiff Kimberly A. Custode (Custode). A discussion
 
between the workers and these Plaintiffs resulted in the workers
 
leaving the area without installing a water meter. It was
 
several months before a water meter was installed.
 
Eckerle encountered Lauster and Custode in the local
 
grocery store. Eckerle felt that these women gave her "dirty
 
looks" and made her "feel as though [she] had done something
 
wrong." She stated that she had received similar looks from
 
various other Plaintiffs on occasions when she traveled on the
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Easement access road. Eckerle also encountered Lauster on other
 
occasions where she felt that Lauster had given her "dirty
 
looks." Eckerle also claimed that Lauster approached her parked
 
car and "snooped" around it, making Eckerle very uncomfortable.
 
She saw Plaintiffs take photographs of her home, her guests, and
 
her property and parked cars close to her property. When she
 
approached these persons to ask what they were doing, they drove
 
off. This behavior made her concerned for her safety and the
 
"abuse" she received from the Plaintiffs caused her emotional
 
distress exhibited as depression, anxiety, and fear. Eckerle
 
sought professional medical help for the emotional distress she
 
experienced and incurred medical expenses of approximately
 
$400.00 to $500.00 for services rendered.5
 
At a jury-waived bench trial commencing August 18,
 
2009, the Circuit Court found that Plaintiffs' concerted conduct,
 
including stopping and blocking vehicles, locking the Easement
 
access road gate to prevent Defendants' vehicles and visitors
 
from accessing the Eckerle Property or using the Easement access
 
road, taking pictures of the Eckerle Property border and overhead
 
aerial photographs, interfering with the work of the Department
 
of Water Supply, and directing dirty looks at Eckerle was
 
reckless and/or intentional conduct. The Circuit Court also
 
found that because there was no evidence that Plaintiffs Steven
 
M. Marks, Roberta L. Bates, Tory M. Taguma, Calvin B. Detwiler,
 
III, Susan H. Detwiler, Laverne Cox, Stephen Cox, Renetta Cox,
 
Gary J. Pries, Melissa Pries, John Hampden Moore and Bonnie Alyce
 
Shannon-Moore participated in, or consented to, the conduct that
 
caused emotional distress to Eckerle, they were not liable to
 
Eckerle for the conduct of the other Plaintiffs. The Circuit
 
Court concluded that the "concerted and cumulative effects of the
 
[remaining Plaintiffs'] actions were outrageous conduct" and
 
caused Eckerle to suffer extreme or severe emotional distress. 
5
 Richard Eckerle did not seek professional medical help, although
he testified that he suffered anxiety, embarrassment, anger, worry, and had
gained over 100 pounds from stress caused by Plaintiffs' conduct.
 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Circuit Court also ruled that Eckerle was entitled to general
 
damages in the amount of $12,000.00 as a result of suffering
 
extreme or severe emotional distress and ordered that the
 
Easement be extinguished.6
 
Plaintiffs timely appealed from the October 20, 2009
 
judgment.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiffs raise the following points on appeal:
 1.	 Findings 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, and 42
are clearly erroneous; Conclusions 9, 11 and 12
are wrong and all are unsupported by the
evidence.
7
 
6 The Circuit Court extinguished the Easement because the Easement
specifically provided that it would continue until, inter alia, the grantees'
used the Eckerle Property for any purpose other than one single family
residence. Medeiros v. Koloa Sugar Co., 29 Haw. 43, 44-45 (Terr. 1926.) The
 
Circuit Court held that when Defendants planted thousands of coffee seedlings
on the Eckerle Property, they breached the covenant that the property be used
only for access to a single-family residence and not for "any . . .
agricultural . . . uses of such real property."
 
7
 FINDINGS OF FACT
 
34. Workers from the Department of Water Supply came to the
Eckerle Property to install a water meter. The workers
 encountered [Lauster and Custode]. The discussion between
 the workers and [Lauster and Custode] resulted in the
workers leaving the area without installing a water meter.
It was several months before a water meter was installed;
during that time [Defendants] also had no access to
catchment water and had to go off-site for water.
(Testimony of [Richard])
 
35. [Eckerle] encountered [Lauster and Custode] in the local
grocery store. She felt they gave her "dirty looks" and
made her "feel as though [she] had done something wrong."
She received similar looks from various [Plaintiffs] on
occasions when she traveled the Easement access road. 
(Testimony of [Eckerle]).
 
36. [Eckerle] encountered [Lauster] on other occasions where
she felt that Lauster had given her "dirty looks." On one
 occasion, Lauster approached [Eckerle]'s parked car and then
"snooped" around it, which made her very uncomfortable.
(Testimony of [Eckerle]).
 
38. [Eckerle] testified that the "abuse" she received from
[Plaintiffs] caused her emotional distress. (Testimony of
[Eckerle]).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2.	 The Circuit Court erred in its Findings 35, 36, 37, and
39 as individually or collectively providing any basis
for its Conclusions 9, 11, 12, and 14.
 
3.	 The Circuit Court erred in its Findings 34, 35, 36, 37,
38, 39, and 40 and Conclusions 9, 11, 12, and 14 by
finding and concluding that matters occurring after the
filing of the pleadings in the subject litigation were
a cause of compensable emotional distress.
 
4.	 The Circuit Court erred in its Findings 34, 35, 36, 37,
38, 39, and 40 and Conclusions 9, 11, 12, and 14 by
considering and relying on matters not pled by Eckerle
as the basis of an award on her Counterclaim.
 
5.	 The Circuit Court erred in its Conclusion 11 that "The
 concerted and cumulative effects of the [Plaintiffs']
actions were outrageous conduct."
 
6.	 The Circuit Court erred in its Conclusion 12 that "The
 concerted and cumulative effect of the [Plaintiffs']
outrageous and reckless conduct caused [Eckerle] to
suffer extreme or severe emotional distress."
 
7(...continued)
40. [Eckerle] suffered emotional distress exhibited as
depression anxiety, and fear because of [Plaintiffs']
conduct. (Testimony of [Eckerle]).
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
9. The [Plaintiffs'] concerted conduct, including stopping
and blocking vehicles, locking the Easement access road gate
to prevent [Defendants'] vehicles and visitors from
accessing the Eckerle Property using the Easement access
road, taking pictures of [Defendants] and their visitors
traveling the Easement access road and guests staying on the
property, taking pictures of the Eckerle Property border and
overhead aerial photographs, interfering with work conducted
by the Department of Water Supply, and directing "dirty
looks" at [Eckerle], is reckless and/or intentional conduct.
See Hac. 
11. The concerted and cumulative effects of the [Plaintiffs]
actions were outrageous conduct. See Hac.
 
12. The concerted and cumulative effects of the [Plaintiffs]
outrageous and reckless conduct caused Daniela Eckerle to
suffer extreme or severe emotional distress. See Hac.
 
14. The court concludes the damages in the amount of twelve
thousand dollars ($12,000.00) is reasonable compensation.
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
7.	 The Circuit Court erred in its Conclusions 13 and 14
 
that [Eckerle] was entitled to damages for extreme or
severe emotional distress in the amount of $12,000.
 
Taken as a whole, Plaintiffs' arguments boil down to
 
their fifth point of error, that is, that the conduct involved in
 
this case did not rise to the level of "outrageous conduct"
 
necessary to support an IIED claim. We agree.
 
The appellate courts are not bound by the conclusions
 
of law made by the trial court; conclusions of law are "freely
 
reviewable" for their correctness. Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 109
 
Hawai'i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005). The elements of the 
IIED tort are well-established:
 
the tort of IIED consists of four elements: "1) that the act
allegedly causing the harm was intentional or reckless, 2)that the act was outrageous, and 3) that the act caused 4)
extreme emotional distress to another." [Hac v. Univ. of Hawai�i, 102 Hawai' i 92, 106–07, 73 P.3d 46, 60–61 (2003)].
"The term 'outrageous' has been construed to mean without
just cause or excuse and beyond all bounds of decency."
Enoka v. AIG Hawai� i Ins. Co., Inc., 109 Hawai' i 537, 559 128
P.3d 850, 872 (2006) (citations and some internal quotation
marks omitted). "The question whether the actions of thealleged tortfeasor are unreasonable or outrageous is for thecourt in the first instance, although where reasonablepeople may differ on that question it should be left to the
jury." Takaki v. Allied Machinery Corp., 87 Hawai' i 57, 68,
951 P.2d 507, 518 (App. 1998) (quotations and quotation
marks omitted). 
Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., 119 Hawai' i 403, 429, 198 P.3d 666, 
692 (2008). An IIED claim generally cannot be based on "threats, 
annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities." Id. at 
425, 198 P.3d at 688 (citation and internal quotation marks 
omitted); see also Shoppe v. Gucci Am., Inc., 94 Hawai' i 368, 
387, 14 P.3d 1049, 1068 (2000) (holding that employer's verbal attacks were not outrageous as a matter of law); Hogan v. Cnty. 
of Lewis, N.Y., Civ. No. 11-754, 2013 WL 936513, at *17 (N.D.N.Y. 
Mar. 8, 2013) (holding that defendants' actions -- verbally 
harassing plaintiffs, shooting fireworks too close to plaintiffs' 
cabin, chasing plaintiffs in cars while honking and veering 
dangerously close to them, and interfering with plaintiffs' right 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
of way over another defendant's land -- did not constitute
 
outrageous conduct as a matter of law).
 
Likewise, here, even if we were to take all of the
 
Circuit Courts' findings of fact as true and considered all the
 
conduct it relied upon in reaching its verdict -- whether well-
pleaded or not -- we reach the conclusion that the conduct relied
 
upon by the Circuit Court was insufficient to constitute an IIED
 
claim as a matter of law.
 
Plaintiffs' actions in stopping access to the Easement
 
road was at least arguably within their rights as property
 
owners. Defendants' use of the Eckerle Property as a coffee farm
 
breached a condition of the Easement and, by its terms, rendered
 
it invalid. ("The term of this Grant . . . shall continue until
 
. . . the Grantee's use of the real property described . . . for
 
any purposes other than one single family residence."). See
 
Restatement (Second) of Torts ("Restatement") § 46 cmt. g (1977)
 (actor not liable where "he has done no more than to insist upon
 
his legal rights in a permissible way, even though he is well
 
aware that such insistence is certain to cause emotional
 
distress"); see also Canto v. J.B. Ivey & Co., 595 So. 2d 1025,
 
1028 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1st Dist. 1992) (store employee
 
detaining plaintiffs' children for shoplifting fell well within
 
"privilege . . . as a matter of law to engage in reckless or even
 
outrageous conduct if there is sufficient evidence that shows the
 
defendant did no more than assert legal rights in a legally
 
permissible way.") (citation and internal quotation marks
 
omitted).
 
Taking pictures of the Eckerle Property and those who
 
drove to it over the easement and giving "dirty looks" to Eckerle
 
fall within the "petty oppressions" that do not rise to the level
 
of outrageousness contemplated by this tort. See, e.g.,
 
Swerdlick v. Koch, 721 A.2d 849, 863 (R.I. 1998) ("defendant's
 persistence in tracking down, recording, and reporting what he
 
deemed to be potential zoning violations after plaintiffs moved
 
portions of their home-based business was not unfounded" and
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
therefore not actionable as IIED) and Bougher v. Univ. of
 
Pittsburgh, 882 F.2d 74, 80 (3d Cir. 1989) (two encounters in
 
public restaurants where defendant allegedly stared at plaintiff
 
in a menacing manner were insufficient to constitute IIED). 
Plaintiffs' interference with government workers in the
 
course of their duties, causing delay in the installation of a
 
water meter on, and water service to, the Eckerle Property, gives
 
us pause. However, insofar as the Circuit Court also found that
 
there is alternative access to the Eckerle Property and there was
 
no finding that this access was somehow inadequate, we fail to
 
see how, by asserting their property rights over the Easement,
 
Plaintiffs' conduct rises to the level of outrageousness.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, the October 20, 2009 Judgment of the Circuit
 
Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in
 
part. The entry of judgment on the Defendants' counterclaim is
 
reversed. All other parts of the judgment are affirmed.
