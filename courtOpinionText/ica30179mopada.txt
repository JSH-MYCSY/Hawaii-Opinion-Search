NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appeal No. CAAP-10-82, but her appeal was later dismissed
 
pursuant to a stipulation by the parties. 
In appeal No. 30179, Husband raises the following
 
points of error with respect to the Amended Divorce Decree:
 
1) the family court erred, made clearly erroneous findings of
 
facts, and its conclusions of law were wrong related to the
 
valuation of the parties' real property; 2) the family court
 
abused its discretion by denying Husband Category 1 credit for
 
his construction business and Category 3 credit for a gift from
 
his mother, and awarding Wife Category 1 credit for her condo;
 
3) the family court abused its discretion by reducing Husband's
 
share of the marital estate by $20,438.50 for $40,877 in
 
"unnecessary" and "unaccounted for" spending; and 4) the family
 
court abused its discretion by imputing $21,315 a month in income
 
to Husband, and awarding excessive child support and alimony to
 
Wife. 
In appeal No. CAAP-10-82, Husband's point of error is
 
that the family court erred in its Order Recalculating Child
 
Support because it did not address the issue of Husband's
 
construction company's business loss; the family court's findings
 
regarding legal fees, travel, personal, and other expenses are
 
not supported by the record and are incomplete; and the business
 
expenses included by the court in Husband's personal income were
 
legitimate business expenses and should not have been added to
 
his monthly earnings for purposes of calculating child support. 
Husband also contends that the family court's findings as to
 
Husband's income during 2009 make clear that the monthly earnings
 
attributed to Husband in the Amended Divorce Decree and the child
 
support awarded in accordance therewith were clearly erroneous
 
and constituted an abuse of discretion. 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm in part,
 
vacate in part, and reverse in part.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
I. Real Property Valuations
 
Husband challenges the family court's valuation of the 
parties' real property, which comprised 80% of their marital 
assets, and alleges that the family court erred in utilizing 
outdated and inaccurate appraisals to value the property during a 
historic downturn in Hawai' i housing prices. We review the 
family court's decisions for an abuse of discretion. Fisher v. 
Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006). Husband 
also argues that the family court failed to make sufficient findings pursuant to Hawai' i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 52 to 
support its valuation of the properties. 
First, Husband argues that the family court erred in
 
valuing the Puhi industrial lot at $574,000. However, as Wife
 contends and Husband concedes, the parties stipulated that the
 
value of the Puhi industrial lot would be the 2006 purchase price
 
so that it would not need to be appraised. This stipulation was
 
initially put on the record at a hearing on December 8, 2008. 
On December 16, 2008, the family court filed an order stating
 
that "[t]he value of the Puhi Industrial lot purchased by
 
[Husband's] Trust shall be valued at the purchase price at time
 
of trial, for purposes of property division." It is clear from
 
the record that the family court ordered that the value of the
 
Puhi industrial lot be set at its 2006 purchase price based on
 
the parties' stipulation. The family court did not abuse its
 
discretion in valuing the Puhi industrial lot based on the
 
parties' stipulation. Husband offers no authority for
 
overturning an order based upon a valid stipulation by the
 
parties. Moreover, given the stipulation by the parties, we see
 
no need for the family court to have made a finding in support of
 
its valuation of the Puhi industrial lot.
 
Second, Husband argues that the family court abused its
 
discretion when it set March 26, 2009 as the valuation date for
 
the parties' real property, three months before trial was
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
eventually held. Trial was originally set for May 8, 2009, with
 
exchange of exhibits and witness lists due by April 24, 2009 (two
 
weeks before the May 8, 2009 trial). At a May 4, 2009 hearing,
 
Wife sought a trial continuance because new appraisals by Jose
 
Diogo (Diogo) had just been submitted by Husband that day. On
 
May 8, 2009, the family court continued the trial until June 26,
 
2009, and set the valuation date based on the valuation date
 
utilized by Husband's appraiser, Diogo, which was March 26, 2009.
 
On May 19, 2009, the family court issued a written order that the
 
trial be continued to June 26, 2009, and that the valuation date
 
for appraisals of the parties' real property would be March 26,
 
2009. On May 27, 2009, Husband filed a motion seeking, inter
 
alia, to set a later date for appraisal of the parties'
 
properties. On June 1, 2009, the court orally denied the motion,
 
and on June 5, 2009, the family court filed an order denying the
 
motion. 
Husband fails to demonstrate that the family court 
abused its discretion in setting March 26, 2009 as the valuation 
date for the appraisals. Husband argues that the relevant date 
for determining the value of the parties' property must be at the 
time of divorce, citing to Myers v. Myers, 70 Haw. 143, 151, 764 
P.2d 1237, 1243 (1988), Markham v. Markham, 80 Hawai' i 274, 287, 
909 P.2d 602, 615 (App. 1996), and Weinberg v. Dickson-Weinberg, 
121 Hawai' i 401, 220 P.3d 264 (App. 2009), vacated in part by 
Weinberg v. Dickson-Weinberg, 123 Hawai' i 68, 229 P.3d 1133 
(2010). First, we note that the part of Weinberg relied upon by 
Husband was vacated by the Hawai' i Supreme Court. Weinberg, 123 
Hawai'i at 70, 229 P.3d at 1135. Second, although Husband is 
correct that "the termination point of the marriage partnership 
for purposes of property division is the conclusion of the 
divorce trial[,]" Markham, at 287, 909 P.2d at 615 (citation 
omitted), none of the cases cited by Husband suggest that a 
family court abuses its discretion when it sets a valuation date 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for the parties' real property three months before trial,
 
especially under circumstances as in this case. Here, the record
 
establishes that trial was scheduled for May 8, 2009, but Wife
 
sought a continuance on May 4, 2009, because Husband had just
 
served her with new appraisals, now done by Diogo, which Wife
 
needed to review and determine if she needed updated appraisals. 
On May 8, 2009, the family court continued the trial and, as
 
clearly expressed on the record on May 8, 2009, the court set the
 
valuation date for the appraisals based on the valuation date
 
utilized by Diogo. Given these circumstances, it was within the
 
discretion of the family court to set a firm valuation date as it
 
did, based on the most recent appraisal.
 
Third, Husband argues that the family court abused its 
discretion in adopting Dennis Nakahara's (Nakahara) appraisals 
rather than Diogo's appraisals. We conclude that Husband fails 
to carry his burden of demonstrating an abuse of discretion by 
the family court in this regard. Husband argues in conclusive 
fashion that Diogo's appraisals were more accurate and up-to­
date, but provides no record citations to the evidence to support 
his arguments. See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 
28(b)(7). Similarly, Husband provides no evidentiary support for his arguments that Nakahara's appraisals were unreliable. The 
record indicates that the major difference between the appraisals 
was that Diogo applied a 2% per month negative time adjustment to 
account for the downturn in prices, whereas Nakahara believed 
such an adjustment was too aggressive and did not accurately 
reflect the reduction in property values on Kauai at the time. 
It is clear from the family court's FOF 18 in its May 20, 2010 
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (5/20/10 Findings and 
Conclusions) and the Property Division Chart attached to the 
Amended Divorce Decree that the family court credited Nakahara's 
appraisals over Diogo's appraisals. "[T]he family court 
possesses wide discretion in making its decisions and those 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
decision[s] will not be set aside unless there is a manifest 
abuse of discretion." Fisher, 111 Hawai' i at 46, 137 P.3d at 360 
(citation omitted, block quote format altered). Further, "[i]t is well-settled that an appellate court will not pass upon issues 
dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of 
evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." Id. 
(citation omitted, internal quotation marks omitted). It was within the family court's discretion to adopt Nakahara's 
appraisals. 
II. Partnership Credits
 
Husband next challenges the family court's rulings
 
which gave Husband no Category 1 credit for his business or
 
Category 3 credit for money from his mother, and which gave Wife
 
Category 1 credit for her condo. Husband further contends that
 
the family court failed to make sufficient findings pursuant to
 
HFCR Rule 52 to support its rulings.
 
First, Husband argues that the family court abused its 
discretion in denying Husband Category 1 credit for his 
construction business on the date of marriage (DOM), which was 
December 1, 2001. When determining a party's Category 1 
property, a court must determine "[t]he net market value (NMV), 
plus or minus, of all property separately owned by one spouse on the date of marriage[.]" Helbush v. Helbush, 108 Hawai' i 508, 
512, 122 P.3d 288, 292 (App. 2005). In the 5/20/10 Findings and 
Conclusions, the family court's FOF 12 states that "[b]ased upon 
the evidence, the Court does not find any date of marriage value 
for [Husband's construction company]." Given the evidence in the 
record, this finding is clearly erroneous. 
Husband adduced evidence and testified at trial related
 
to his business at DOM including, inter alia, a balance sheet
 
(with assets and liabilities), an income statement for November
 
2001 (setting forth operating income, direct expenses, gross
 
profits, and net profit), and bank statements showing a total of 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
approximately $79,286 in two accounts under the business. 
Husband asserts on appeal that the family court should have
 
awarded him $97,586 in Category 1 credit ($79,286 in cash and
 
$18,300 in depreciated equipment) for his business. Husband
 
points out that the family court apparently utilized available
 
cash and the value of equipment in setting the value of the
 
business as of the date of the conclusion of the evidentiary part
 
of trial (DOCOEPOT), see Property Division Chart, and thus
 
Husband argues that a similar valuation method should be used to
 
value the business at DOM.
 
We conclude that the family court clearly erred in
 
finding that there was no DOM value for Husband's business. We
 
remand to the family court to determine the appropriate amount of
 
Category 1 credit that should be awarded to Husband.
 
Second, Husband argues that the family court abused its
 
discretion in granting Wife $14,022 in Category 1 credit based on
 
the post-DOM sale of her condo and post-DOM mortgage balance. It
 
is clear from the record that the family court used the August
 
2002 sales price of $112,000, a mortgage payoff of $82,978, and
 
Wife's personal debt of $15,000 at DOM to calculate Wife's
 
Category 1 credit. The family court apparently ignored Diogo's
 
DOM $97,000 appraisal of the condo and a mortgage statement
 
showing a balance of $83,552 at DOM. 
The family court did not abuse its discretion in using
 
the August 2002 sales price as the DOM value of the condo, rather
 
than Diogo's DOM appraisal. Wife testified that the condo
 
entered into escrow six or seven months after the marriage, and
 
that during that period the market was stable. Wife further
 
asserts that the best comparable was the actual sale of the
 
property in question, her condo, rather than other properties
 
utilized by Diogo. As Wife points out, some of the comparable
 
properties utilized by Diogo had contract or closing dates more
 
than six months before the DOM. Thus, given the evidence, the
 
7
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
family court did not abuse its discretion in relying on the later
 
sales price of Wife's condo.
 
However, the family court did abuse its discretion in
 
using the August 2002 mortgage payoff in its calculations rather
 
than the DOM mortgage balance, which can be deduced from exhibit
 
D-23, the mortgage statement dated January 1, 2002. There does
 
not appear to be any valid reason for the family court to use a
 
post-marriage mortgage balance in its calculations instead of the
 
DOM mortgage balance. Thus, the proper mortgage amount at DOM
 
was $83,552 and Wife's Category 1 credit should be adjusted to
 
$13,448.2
 
Third, Husband argues that the family court abused its
 
discretion in denying Husband Category 3 credit for a gift from
 
his mother. Wife contends in response that the money from
 
Husband's mother was a gift to the entire family. In its Amended
 
Divorce Decree, the family court found "that the $10,605.00 from
 
[Husband's] mother to be a gift to the parties and therefore
 
excluded from the division of property." In its 5/20/10 Findings
 
and Conclusions, the family court stated that "[t]he payment of
 
$10,605.00 from Husband's mother is found to be a gift to the
 
parties." 
Husband is correct that the family court failed to make 
findings as to the elements of a gift. We must therefore remand
 
this case to the family court to make specific findings as to the
 
elements of whether a gift was made. Gussin v. Gussin, 73 Haw.
 
470, 489, 836 P.2d 484, 494 (1992) (holding that it was error not
 to remand the issue of a gift where the family court failed to
 
make findings as to donative intent or any other element whether
 
gift was made). "To constitute a gift the essential elements are
 
(1) donative intent, (2) delivery, and (3) acceptance[.]" Id.
 
2
 As the parties agree, Wife acknowledged a $15,000 personal debt at
DOM. Therefore, her Category 1 credit is calculated as follows: $112,000 ­
$83,552 - $15,000 = $13,448.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
9(citation omitted).  Therefore, pursuant to Gussin , we remand the
issue of the gift to the family court to make specific findings
as to the elements of whether the $10,605 was a gift from
Husband's mother to the parties jointly.
III. Dissipation of Marital Estate
Husband argues that the family court abused its
discretion by reducing Husband's share of the marital estate by
$20,438.50 for $40,877 in "unnecessary" and "unaccounted for"
spending, and that the family court made insufficient findings. 
In its Amended Divorce Decree, the family court ordered as
follows:
Excessive Spending:
The costs of Jose Diogo's appraisals and Wendell
Ishida's appraisals were unnecessary and shall be assessed
to Defendant as reflected on the Property Division Chart. 
As to the Lae Road improvements, one-half of the $20,991.00
shall be assessed to Defendant as reflected on the Property
Division Chart.  As to the unaccounted for withdrawals, one-
half of the $16,765.00 in unaccounted for withdrawals shall
be assessed to Defendant as reflected on the Property
Division Chart. 
In its 5/20/10 Findings and Conclusions, the family
court's FOF 30 found that "the costs of Jose Diogo's appraisals
and Wendel[] Ishida's appraisals were unnecessary.  As to the Lae
Road improvements, one-half shall be assessed to Husband."  In
FOF 31, the family court found that "there were unaccounted for
withdrawals by Husband, and one-half of the $16,765.00 in
unaccounted for withdrawals shall be assessed to Husband."
"A reduction of the dollar value of the marital estate
chargeable to a divorcing party occurs when, during the time of
the divorce, a party's action or inaction caused a reduction of
the dollar value of the marital estate under such circumstances
that he or she equitably should be charged with having received
the dollar value of the reduction ."  Higashi v. Higashi, 106
Hawai#i 228, 241, 103 P.3d 388, 401 (App. 2004) (emphasis added). 
"When the court decides that a divorcing party chargeably reduced
the dollar value of the marital estate, the court must add theNOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
dollar amount of that chargeable reduction to the dollar value of
 
the marital estate and treat that dollar amount as having been
 
awarded to the divorcing party who caused that chargeable
 
reduction." Id. at 241-42, 103 P.3d at 401-02.
 
Based on our review of the record and the family
 
court's findings, we conclude that except for the expense related
 
to Wendel Ishida's (Ishida) appraisal, the family court abused
 
its discretion and/or failed to make appropriate findings related
 
to the charges assessed against Husband.
 
Ishida's appraisal was related to the Puhi industrial
 
lot, which the parties stipulated on December 8, 2008 would be
 
valued at its 2006 purchase price. Ishida's appraisal was
 
completed on April 13, 2009, after the stipulation, and was thus
 
clearly an unnecessary and inappropriate expense. We affirm the
 
family court's charge of Ishida's appraisal costs to Husband.
 
Diogo's appraisals, on the other hand, were related to
 
the other properties and, moreover, the family court denied
 
Wife's motion to strike Diogo's appraisals, which were ultimately
 
admitted into evidence at trial. Hence, the family court abused
 
its discretion in determining that the expense for Diogo's
 
appraisals was an inappropriate reduction in the marital estate
 
chargeable to Husband. We reverse the family court's charge of
 
Diogo's appraisal costs to Husband.
 
With respect to the $20,991 in improvements to the Lae
 
Road property and the $16,765 in "unaccounted for" withdrawals,
 
the family court's findings are not "sufficiently comprehensive
 
and pertinent to the issues to disclose to this court the steps
 
by which [the family court] reached its ultimate conclusion" on
 
these factual issues. Doe v. Roe, 5 Haw. App. 558, 566, 705 P.2d
 
535, 543 (1985). Although a family court is only obligated to
 make "brief, definite, pertinent findings and conclusions upon
 
the contested matters" and "there is no necessity for over-
elaboration of detail or particularization of facts[,]" Id. at
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
565, 705 P.2d at 542 (internal quotation mark and citation 
omitted), the family court's findings provide no indication why 
husband "equitably should be charged with having received the 
dollar value of the reduction." Higashi, 106 Hawai' i at 241, 103 
P.3d at 401. Husband contends that improvements to the Lae Road property were considered in Nakahara's appraisal as of March 26, 
2009 and thus were included in the valuation of the marital 
property. We make no determination on this contention, but we 
note that it certainly could bear on whether it would be 
equitable to charge Husband for the Lae Road property 
improvements. As to the withdrawals, the family court's finding 
that they are unaccounted for does not necessarily mean that it 
is equitable to charge them against Husband. We thus vacate the 
charges against Husband related to the Lae Road property 
improvements and the withdrawals, and we remand these issues to 
the family court. 
IV. Child Support and Alimony Under Amended Divorce Decree
 
Husband argues that the family court abused its
 
discretion by awarding excessive child support and alimony to
 
Wife. Husband claimed at trial that he was earning $2,266 a
 
month at DOCOEPOT. The family court's Amended Decree ordered in
 
relevant part that "Defendant's gross monthly income [is] imputed
 
at $21,315.00 per month based upon averaging his annual salary
 
from the date of marriage through 2008" and FOF 16 in the 5/20/10
 
Findings and Conclusions likewise stated that Husband's average
 
gross income per month from DOM to the time of trial was $21,315
 
per month. The family court ordered that, based on the child
 
support guidelines, Husband pay Wife $2,200 per month in child
 
support for the parties' son. The family court also ordered that
 
Husband pay Wife alimony of $2,000 per month from September 1,
 
2009 to June 1, 2011.
 
As authorized under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 576D-7 (2006 Repl.), the Hawai' i Child Support Guidelines 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(Guidelines) set forth criteria for establishing the proper
 
amount of child support. See also HRS § 580-47 (2006 Repl. and
 
Supp. 2012) ("In establishing the amounts of child support, the
 court shall use the guidelines established under section 576D­
7.").
 
In order to determine the amount of a child support
obligation, it is necessary to determine each parent's gross
monthly income. For a parent employed by a business or other
entity, this determination is usually accomplished by a
review of the pay stub or some other verification by his or
her employer as to how much his or her income is each month.
For the self-employed parent, however, the amount of his or
her gross monthly income is usually more difficult to
determine.
 
Doe v. Child Support Enforcement Agency of Hawaii, 87 Hawai' i 
178, 182, 953 P.2d 209, 213 (App. 1998). Under the 2004 
Guidelines, which were applicable when the Amended Divorce Decree 
was issued on November 9, 2009, we conclude that the family court 
abused its discretion in its award of child support. 
According to the 2004 Guidelines, gross income
 
"includes income from all sources that are regular and
 
consistent[.]" The 2004 Guidelines further provides: "Imputed
 
income may be used when a parent is not employed full-time or is
 
employed below full earning capacity. The reasons for this
 
limitation must be considered." 2004 Guidelines at 1, 3.
 
The family court made no findings as to why it imputed
 
income to Husband of $21,315 per month, or to indicate it had
 
considered the reasons for Husband's limitation to full-time
 
employment or full earning capacity. The family court did not
 
suggest or find that Husband was purposely not seeking work, or
 
that Husband had the ability at that time to secure a monthly
 
income of $21,315. We must therefore vacate the family court's
 
Amended Divorce Decree to the extent that it ordered child
 
support of $2,200 per month based on imputed income of $21,315
 
per month for Husband. This issue is remanded to the family
 
court for further proceedings.
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
13The family court also abused its discretion in awarding
alimony to Wife without considering the factors required under
HRS § 580-47.  With respect to a family court's alimony award,
HRS § 580-47(a) states that
the court shall take into consideration: the respective
merits of the parties, the relative abilities of the
parties, the condition in which each party will be left by
the divorce, the burdens imposed upon either party for the
benefit of the children of the parties, the concealment of
or failure to disclose income or an asset, or violation of a
restraining order issued under section 580-10(a) or (b), if
any, by either party, and all other circumstances of the
case.
HRS § 580-47(a) further requires a court to consider a list of
thirteen factors.  See HRS § 580-47(a).
In Cassiday v. Cassiday, 6 Haw. App. 207, 716 P.2d 1145
(1985), rev'd on other ground , 68 Haw. 383, 716 P.2d 1133 (1986),
this court articulated some of the relevant factual questions
under HRS § 580-47(a) as being:
1. Taking into account the property awarded in the
divorce case to the party seeking spousal support, what
amount, if any, does he or she need to maintain the standard
of living established during the marriage? . . .
2. Taking into account the income of the party seeking
spousal support, or what it should be, and the income
producing capability of the property awarded to him or her
in the divorce action, what is his or her ability to meet
his or her need independently? . . .
3. Taking into account the income of the party from
whom spousal support is sought, or what it should be, and
the income producing capability of the property awarded to
him or her in the divorce action, what is his or her ability
to meet his or her own need while meeting the need for
spousal support of the party seeking spousal support?
Id. at 215-16, 716 P.2d at 1151; See also  Vorfeld v. Vorfeld,
8 Haw. App. 391, 402, 804 P.2d 891, 897-98 (1991).  Because no
determination was made by the family court in Cassiday as to
several of the factual questions, this court reversed the award
of spousal support and remanded for further proceedings.  Id.  at
216, 716 P.2d at 1151. NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 The recalculated child support took effect on March 1, 2010.3
14Here, the family court's sole finding of fact with
respect to alimony was FOF 28, stating that "Husband has a
significantly greater earning capacity than Wife and that Wife
shall be entitled to alimony in the sum of $2,000.00 per month
commencing on September 1, 2009, and terminating on June 1,
201l."  The family court abused its discretion in awarding Wife
$2,000 a month in alimony without some indication that it had
considered the factors pursuant to HRS § 580-47(a) or made the
relevant factual determinations.  Accordingly, we vacate the
family court's award of spousal support and remand for further
proceedings.
V. Recalculation of Child Support
The Amended Divorce Decree provided that child support
would be recalculated annually, with the parties to provide each
other "all financial documents for the previous calendar year
from which that party's gross monthly income can be calculated." 
Husband argues that the family court erred in its recalculation
of child support,3 and additionally argues that the family court
made insufficient findings of fact pursuant to HFCR Rule 52. 
In its September 8, 2010 Order Recalculating Child
Support, the family court found Husband's monthly income for the
purpose of recalculating child support to be $4,312.95 per month. 
The court ordered Husband to pay Wife $320.00 per month in child
support.
In its subsequent December 23, 2010 Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order (12/23/10 Findings and Conclusions),
the family court made the following findings in support of its
recalculated child support order:
4.In 2009, Defendant received $16,580 in unemployment
benefits;
5.In 2009, Defendant received $16,000 as wages
from [Husband's business];NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
6.	 In 2009, [Husband's business] paid Defendant's
attorney $15,487.50 for legal representation in
Defendant's divorce case;
 
7.	 In 2009, [Husband's business] paid for
Defendant's out of state travel in the amount of
 $3,155.04;
 
8.	 In 2009, [Husband's business] credit card was
used to cover Defendant's personal expenditures
in the amount of $3,140.81;
 
[9.]	
 In 2009, [Husband's business] also paid and/or
reimbursed Defendant for other expenses of
Defendant which amount to approximately
$1,853.96 per month.
 
Based on these findings, the family court concluded that child
 
support calculations for 2010 would be based, inter alia, upon
 
Husband's "calculated gross monthly income of $6,384.24," and
 
that Husband was entitled to a monthly credit of $2,000 for
 
spousal support payments made to Wife. Thus, under the 12/23/10
 
Findings and Conclusions, child support is to be calculated based
 
on $4,384.24 gross monthly income attributed to Husband.
 
We first note, as Husband points out, that there is no
 
explanation in the 12/23/10 Findings and Conclusions for the
 
discrepancy between the $4,384.24 figure therein and the
 
$4,312.95 figure in the September 8, 2010 Order Recalculating
 
Child Support. Because we will remand as to the recalculated
 
child support, the family court will be able to readdress this
 
issue.
 
Husband first argues that the family court failed to
 
reduce his 2009 income by $13,102 in business losses that were
 
claimed on his tax returns. Under the 2010 Guidelines, which
 
were in effect when the family court recalculated child support,
 
"gross income" includes "income from self-employment[,]" and in
 
turn, "[s]elf-employed individuals must report gross income minus
 
ordinary, necessary and reasonable business/operating
 
expenses[.]" 2010 Guidelines at 17-18, 23. Husband sought to
 
deduct overall business losses for 2009, not "ordinary, necessary
 
and reasonable business/operating expenses." Thus, it is
 
15
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
questionable whether such alleged losses are allowed to be
 
deducted under the Guidelines. Moreover, assuming arguendo
 
deduction of such losses are allowed under the Guidelines, this
 
court has noted favorably that
 
[o]ther jurisdictions have concluded that a
self-employed parent's business deductions should be
carefully scrutinized to avoid the sheltering of income at
the expense of lessening income available for child support.
They have also recognized that tax returns alone do not
always provide an accurate determination of a self-employed
parent's income. It is the disposable income of the parent
and not their income tax returns alone, which must be
considered by the Court.
 
Doe, 87 Hawai' i at 182, 953 P.2d at 213 (internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted). Based on the record, the family court did 
not abuse its broad discretion in not reducing Husband's 2009 
gross income based on the business losses allegedly incurred by 
his construction company. 
We next address Husband's challenge to the expenses
 
paid by his business that were added to his gross income. First,
 
we reject Husband's challenge to the family court's finding that
 
added $15,487.50 to Husband's income for legal representation in
 
the parties' divorce. The finding is not clearly erroneous and
 
the expense is clearly related to Husband's personal expenses. 
Second, we also reject Husband's challenge to the $3,140.81 added
 
to his gross income. The family court specifically found that
 
this amount was for Husband's personal expenditures and Husband
 
fails to demonstrate this finding is clearly erroneous.
 
However, as to the family court's findings that added
 
$3,155.04 for "out of state travel" and $1,853.96 per month for
 
4
other expenses  to Husband's income, we conclude these findings
are insufficient because they fail to indicate they were for
 
Husband's personal expenses. See
 2010 Guidelines at 23. We thus
 
vacate the Order Recalculating Child Support to the extent it is
 
4
 The $1,853.96 per month amounted to a total of $22,247.52 being
 
added to Husband's income for 2009.

based on Husband's income including these amounts, and we remand
 
these issues for further consideration by the family court.
 
VI. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the November 9, 2009 Amended
 
Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding Child Custody and the
 
related 5/20/10 Findings and Conclusions are affirmed in part,
 
reversed in part, and vacated in part. The September 8, 2010
 
Order Recalculating Child Support and the related 12/23/10
 
Findings and Conclusions are affirmed in part and vacated in
 
part. We remand this case to the family court for further
 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
