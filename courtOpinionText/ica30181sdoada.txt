v.
 
DAVID E. SCONDRAS, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
» EWA DIVISION 
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-09-031720)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant David Scondras (Scondras) appeals 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and 
Plea/Judgment filed on October 19, 2009 in the District Court of 
the First Circuit, 
» Ewa Division (District Court).1 
Scondras was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes § 291C-105(a)(1)-(2) (2007
 
Repl.). At trial, over the objection of defense counsel, the
 
District Court admitted testimony by Officer Everett Sakai
 
(Officer Sakai) that a laser gun reading showed Scondras's
 
vehicle traveling at 88 mph.2
 
1 The Honorable David Lo presided.
 
2 Scondras objected to testimony about Officer Sakai's training, his
testing and operation of the laser gun, and to the laser gun reading.

On appeal, Scondras contends that the District Court
 
erred in convicting him without sufficient foundation that the
 
laser gun was tested according to the manufacturer's recommended
 
procedures. Scondras further contends that there was
 
insufficient proof that Officer Sakai was qualified by training
 
and experience to operate the laser gun.
 
The State concedes that it failed to lay sufficient
 
foundation for admission of the laser gun speed reading and
 
agrees that the conviction should be reversed.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Scondras s points of error as follows:
 
Officer Sakai initially testified that he received a
 
training "manual provided by . . . the manufacturer" of his laser
 
gun; that his "training [was] based upon that manual"; that he
 
was taught the four tests "recommended by the manufacturer to
 
determine whether or not the [laser gun] was working properly"
 
which were "contained in the manual"; that he performed those
 
tests "in the way that [he was] trained"; and that "the device
 
[was] working properly within the manufacturer's
 
specifications[.]" However, Officer Sakai later acknowledged
 
that the manual had a Honolulu Police Department (HPD) emblem on
 
its cover, and he did not know if the manufacturer wrote the
 
manual or if HPD wrote the manual. 
In light of the foregoing, the record does not 
sufficiently reflect that the laser gun was tested, or that 
Officer Sakai was trained, in accordance with the manufacturer's 
specifications. Consequently, the State failed to adduce 
sufficient evidence regarding the accuracy of the laser gun 
reading, and the laser gun reading should not have been admitted 
into evidence. State v. Assaye , 121 Hawai» i 204, 210-14, 216

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.3d 1227, 1233-37 (2009). Without evidence of the laser gun
 
reading, there is insufficient evidence to convict Scondras of
 
Excessive Speeding. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, filed on October 19, 
2009 in the District Court of the First Circuit, » Ewa Division, 
is reversed.
