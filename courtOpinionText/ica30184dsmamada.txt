NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
NO. 30184
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
KENNETH JELKS, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-0805)
 
AMENDED
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
appellate jurisdiction over Petitioner-Appellant Kenneth Jelks's
 
appeal from the October 12, 2009 "Order Dismissing Defendant's
 
Motion to Reduce Petitioner Kenneth Jelks' May 10, 2006 Order to
 
a Separate Judgment" (Order), which was erroneously filed in
 
Cr. No. 94-0257. 
The Notice of Appeal in the instant appeal
 
purports to be an appeal from Civil No. 06-1-0805, in which the
 Order was not entered as part of the record. There is no final
 
appealable order or judgment from which to appeal in Civil
 
No. 06-1-0805. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 14, 2012.
