NO. 30185
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
WAHI HO#OMALU LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, 
a Hawai #i limited partnership, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v.
ROSEMARIE L.K. YEE, Defendant-Appellant,
and
HEIRS OR ASSIGNS OF KEKINO(w), et al., Defendants-Appellees
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-0140)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Wahi Ho #omalu
Limited Partnership's (Appellee Wahi Ho #omalu) February 22, 2010
motion to dismiss Defendant-Appellant Rosemarie L. K. Lee's
(Appellant Lee) appeal for lack of jurisdiction, (2) the lack of
any response by Appellant Lee to Appellee Wahi Ho #omalu's
February 22, 2010 motion to dismiss Appellant Lee's appeal for
lack of jurisdiction, and (3) the record, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over Appellant Lee's appeal from the Honorable
Joseph E. Cardoza's February 9, 2009 judgment, because Appellant
Lee's appeal is untimely under both Rule 4(a)(1) and
Rule 4.1(b)(1) of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure
(HRAP).
The February 9, 2009 judgment resolves all claims in
this case, and, thus, the February 9, 2009 judgment is an
appealable final judgment under Hawai# i Revised Statutes NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-ยง 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009), Rule 58 of the Hawai# i Rules of
Civil Procedure, and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai #i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338
(1994).  However, Appellant Yee did file her November 18, 2009
notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the February
9, 2009 judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) requires.  Therefore,
Appellant Yee's appeal in appellate court case number 30185 is
untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1).  Even if we would treat
Appellant Yee's appeal as a cross-appeal from Defendant-Appellant
Henry Maio, Jr.'s (Appellant Maio), March 10, 2009 notice of
appeal that resulted in appellate court case number 29702,
Appellant Yee did not file her November 18, 2009 notice of appeal
within sixteen days after Appellant Maio's March 10, 2009 service
by mail of Appellant Maio's March 10, 2009 notice of appeal, as
HRAP Rule 4.1(b)(1) and HRAP Rule 26(c) require for a notice of
cross-appeal when another party has served a notice of appeal by
mail.  Therefore, Appellant Yee's appeal in appellate court case
number 30185 is untimely as a cross-appeal under HRAP Rule
4.1(b)(1).
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
of judicial discretion.  Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
justice thereof is authorized to change the jurisdictional
requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP].").  Consequently,
we lack appellate jurisdiction over Appellant Yee's appeal in
appellate court case number 30185.  Therefore,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-3-IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Wahi Ho# omalu's
February 22, 2010 motion to dismiss Appellant Lee's appeal for
lack of jurisdiction is granted and this appeal is dismissed.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, April 15, 2010.
