APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai
'i (State) appeals 
from the "Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Defendant's 
Motion to Dismiss Complaint" (Order Dismissing Complaint) filed in the Family Court of the Second Circuit (Family Court).
1 The 
State charged Herman Decoite (Decoite) by complaint with abuse of a family or household member, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 709-906.
2 The complaint alleged that Decoite 
committed the offense "as a continuing course of conduct" during a period of time spanning twenty-eight months. 
Decoite moved to dismiss the complaint arguing that
 
"the law does not permit prosecution of a continuing course of
 conduct actus reus for abuse of a household or family member."

 HRS § 709-906(1) (Supp. 2012) provides in relevant part that "[i]t
shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in concert, to physically abuse a
family or household member . . . ."
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Family Court granted Decoite's motion to dismiss, concluding
 
that "[t]he Hawaii State Legislature did not intend for Abuse of
 a Family Member, HRS § 709-906, to be charged on a continuous
 conduct theory."
 
We conclude that the Family Court erred in ruling that
 
the State was categorically precluded from charging the offense
 of abuse of a family or household member as a continuing course
 of conduct. We conclude that depending on the particular facts
 of the case, the State may charge and prove the offense as
 committed through a continuing course of conduct. In this case,
 based on the State's proffers regarding the nature of its
 anticipated evidence, we cannot say that the State's decision to
 charge the offense as a continuing course of conduct was
 impermissible. Accordingly, we vacate the Order Dismissing
 Complaint and remand the case for further proceedings.
 
BACKGROUND
 
I.
 
On April 3, 2009, the State filed a complaint against
 
Decoite charging him with abuse of a family or household member. 
The alleged victim and complaining witness (CW) was Decoite's
 girlfriend, with whom he had been in a relationship for five
 years. The complaint alleged:
 
That during or about the period between February 1,
2005, through June 1, 2007, inclusive, as a continuing
course of conduct, in the County of Maui, State of Hawaii,
HERMAN DECOITE did intentionally, knowingly or recklessly
engage in and cause physical abuse of a family or household
member, to wit, [the CW], thereby committing the offense of
Abuse of Family or Household Member in violation of Section
709-906 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
II.
 
Decoite filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In
 
his motion, Decoite argued that "the law does not permit
 
prosecution of a continuing course of conduct actus reus for
 abuse of a household or family member." He further argued that
 "HRS 709-906 does not contain any 'continuing course of conduct'
 language. Rather, the conduct proscribed involves discrete
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
incidents only." Decoite also asserted that allowing the State
 
to prosecute the case on a theory of a continuing course of
 conduct over a two-year period would violate his due process
 rights. Decoite stated that the discovery provided by the State
 consisted of police reports regarding two incidents that occurred
 on November 29, 2006, and March 13, 2007, and that "[i]t would be
 a stretch for the State to assert that two incidents that
 occurred over two years apart demonstrate a course of conduct."
 
The State filed a memorandum in opposition to Decoite's
 
motion to dismiss. The State stated that during the period of
 time charged in the complaint:
 
[Decoite] is alleged to have strangled [the CW] on numerous
occasions to the point that she would pass out, beating her
on numerous occasions to the point of unconsciousness,
beating her on numerous occasions to the point that visible
bruising would appear on her body and face, beating her with
a polo mallet, and, on one occasion witnessed by her
children, throwing a rope around her and dragging her behind
her horse.
 
The State attached to its memorandum a petition for temporary
 
restraining order filed on July 9, 2009, by the CW against
 Decoite. In the petition, the CW stated:
 
Over the last 5 years, [Decoite's] physical and mental
abuse has escalated. In 2006, [Decoite] would beat me at
least once a week with a Polo Mallet. He knocked me
 unconscious at least twice a month. There have been many
times when we were being intimate; [Decoite] would strangle
me during his climax, to the point where I'm about to pass
out. I was extremely terrified and felt afraid to talk to
[Decoite] about it.
 
The State argued that HRS § 709-906 can be charged as a
 
continuing offense because the required element, "to physically
 
abuse a family or household member," "can extend beyond isolated
 moments." It argued that similar to the crimes of theft,
 terroristic threatening, and torture, HRS § 709-906 can be
 charged as a continuing course of conduct. The State proffered
 the testimony of Stacy Moniz, a domestic violence expert, that
 abusive relationships involve a pattern and cycle of violence in
 which the batterer is attempting to exercise power and control
 over his or her partner.

III. 
After holding a hearing on Decoite's motion to dismiss
 
the complaint, the Family Court granted the motion. The Family
 
Court issued its Order Dismissing Complaint, in which it made the
 following conclusions of law:
 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
 
1.	 The Hawaii State Legislature did not intend for Abuse
of a Family Member, HRS § 709-906, to be charged on a
continuous conduct theory.
 
2.	 The definition of "physical abuse," as it is used in
HRS § 709-906, means to maltreat in such a manner as
to cause injury, hurt or damage to the body.
 
3.	 Such injury, hurt or damage may be caused by a single
act or a succession of acts.
 
4.	 The term "physical abuse" can be something that
extends beyond isolated moments.
 
5.	 The element of "physical abuse" must be proven for
each charge under HRS § 709-906.
 
6.	 The definition of "physical abuse" indicates that the
Hawaii State Legislature did not intend for HRS § 709­906 to be charged on the basis of continuous conduct.
 
7.	 The inclusion of enhanced penalties for multiple
offenders in HRS § 709-906 indicates that the Hawaii
State Legislature did not intend for HRS § 709-906 to
be charged on the basis of continuous conduct.
 
The State timely appealed from the Order Dismissing
 
Complaint. 
DISCUSSION
 
I.
 
On appeal, the State argues that the Family Court erred 
in construing the legislative intent behind HRS § 709-906 and in 
concluding that the offense could not be charged as a continuing course of conduct. 
The State asserts that under Hawai' i 
precedents, HRS § 709-906 satisfies the test for a continuing offense and can be charged as a continuing course of conduct. As explained below, we conclude that HRS § 709-906 can be charged as a continuing course of conduct and that the Family Court erred in dismissing the complaint based on its interpretation of HRS § 709-906 as precluding a charge based on this theory. We 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
further conclude that based on the State's proffers regarding the
 
nature of its anticipated evidence, we cannot say that the
 State's charging the offense as a continuing course of conduct
 was impermissible. Accordingly, we vacate the Order Dismissing
 Complaint and remand for further proceedings. 
II.
 
HRS § 709-906(1) states in pertinent part that "[i]t 
shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in concert, to physically abuse a family or household member[.]" The term "physical abuse" is not defined in the statute, but the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court has stated that "as ordinarily used[,] abuse means to maltreat and connotes such treatment as will injure, hurt or damage a person." State v. Kameenui, 69 Haw. 620, 623, 753 P.2d 1250, 1252 (1988) (citing City of Cincinnati v. McIntosh, 251 N.E.2d 624 (Ohio Ct. App. 1969)). This court has similarly held that "to 'physically abuse' someone means to maltreat in such a manner as to cause injury, hurt, or damage to that person's body." State v. Nomura, 79 Hawai' i 413, 415-16, 903 P.2d 718, 
720-21 (App. 1995) (upholding jury instructions which stated that: "'Physical abuse' means causing bodily injury to another person[,]" and "'[b]odily injury' means physical pain, illness or any impairment of physical conditions"). 
A first violation of HRS § 709-906 is a misdemeanor,
 
with increased sentences for repeat offenders.
3 Decoite was

 HRS § 709-906 (Supp. 2012) provides in relevant part:
 
(5) Abuse of a family or household member and refusal to
comply with the lawful order of a police officer under subsection
(4) are misdemeanors and the person shall be sentenced as follows:
 
(a)	 For the first offense the person shall serve a minimum jail
sentence of forty-eight hours; and
 
(b)	 For a second offense that occurs within one year of the
first conviction, the person shall be termed a "repeat
offender" and serve a minimum
 jail sentence of thirty
days.
 
. . . .
 
(continued...)
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
charged in this case as a first-time violator of HRS § 709-906,
 
and therefore his offense was a misdemeanor that was subject to a
 two-year statute of limitations. HRS § 701-108(2)(e) (Supp.
 2012) ("A prosecution for a misdemeanor . . . must be commenced
 within two years after it is committed[.]"). Under HRS § 701­108(4) (Supp. 2012):
 
An offense is committed either when every element
occurs, or, if a legislative purpose to prohibit a
continuing course of conduct plainly appears, at the time
when the course of conduct or the defendant's complicity
therein is terminated. Time starts to run on the day after
the offense is committed.
 
The complaint against Decoite was filed on April 3,
 
2009. Therefore if Decoite's alleged offense was not a
 
continuing offense and could not be charged as a continuing
 course of conduct under HRS § 701-108(4), acts committed prior to
 April 3, 2007, would be outside the statute of limitations. On
 the other hand, if Decoite's alleged offense was a continuing
 offense and was committed as a continuing course of conduct, then
 acts committed prior to April 3, 2007, would not be barred by the
 statute of limitations as long as they were part of a criminal
 course of conduct that terminated after April 3, 2007.
 
III.
 
In State v. Martin, 62 Haw. 364, 616 P.2d 193 (1980), 
the Hawai' i Supreme Court addressed the questions of whether the 
offense of theft by deception was a continuing offense and whether it qualified under HRS § 701-108(4) as a "continuing course of conduct" offense for purposes of applying the statute of limitations. Martin's charge was based on her receipt of public assistance benefits through the filing of semi-annual statements which misrepresented facts relevant to her continued eligibility for the benefits. Id. at 365-67, 616 P.2d at 195-96. 
3(...continued)
 
(7) For a third or any subsequent offense that occurs
within two years of a second or subsequent conviction, the offense
shall be a class C felony.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Martin was indicted on August 17, 1977, and charged with
 
wrongfully obtaining public assistance benefits by deception
 during the period of January 1, 1973, through January 30, 1976. 
Id. at 366 n.1, 372, 616 P.2d at 195 n.1, 198. The statute of
 limitations for the charged offense was three years, id. at 371,
 616 P.2d at 198, and therefore a portion of the period of the
 alleged offense ostensibly fell outside the statute of
 limitations.
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court adopted the following rule 
applied by California courts to determine whether an offense constitutes a continuing offense: 
[T]he applicable test in determining whether there is a
continuing crime "is whether the evidence discloses one
general intent or discloses separate and distinct intents."
. . . [I]f "there is but one intention, one general impulse,
and one plan, even though there is a series of transactions,
there is but one offense."
 
Id. at 368, 616 P.2d at 196 (quoting People v. Howes, 222 P.2d 
969, 976 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1950). Applying this analysis, the Hawai'i Supreme Court found that Martin had one intention and 
plan and therefore concluded that there was one offense. Id. at 
369, 616 P.2d at 197. In support of this conclusion the supreme court stated: 
We do not view each filing by defendant of a statement of
facts supporting continued eligibility as necessarily
constituting a new offense, since all statements were
identical, representing that defendant was unmarried,
unemployed, and not receiving social security benefits.
Id.
 
The supreme court then considered Martin's argument
 
that the statute of limitations precluded prosecution. The court
 
concluded that Martin's theft offense qualified as a "continuing
 course of conduct" offense under HRS § 701-108(4), stating:
 
The language of the theft statute plainly manifests a
legislative intent to prohibit continuing conduct since two
elements of the pertinent crime, deception and the exercise
of control over the property of another, involve conduct
that can extend beyond isolated moments, particularly the
former. Conduct deceptive enough to effect grand theft may
often entail elaborate schemes of extended conduct.
 
Martin, 62 Haw. at 371-72, 616 P.2d at 198 (emphasis added). The
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
court held that the statute of limitations did not bar Martin's
 
prosecution because the last false statement she filed was in
 September 1975 and the last public assistance benefit she
 wrongfully received was on January 2, 1976, and therefore her
 offense continued to a time within the three-year statute of
 limitations. Id. at 372, 616 P.2d at 198.
 
In cases after Martin, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has 
applied the same basic test for determining whether an offense is a continuing offense. In State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai' i 1, 928 P.2d 
843 (1996), the court stated: 
This court has defined a "continuing offense" as
 
a continuous, unlawful act or series of acts set on
foot by a single impulse and operated by an
unintermittent force, however long a time it may
occupy[, or] an offense which continues day by day[,
or] a breach of the criminal law, not terminated by a
single act or fact, but subsisting for a definite
period and intended to cover or apply to successive
similar obligations or occurrences.
 
State v. Temple, 65 Haw. 261, 267 n.6, 650 P.2d 1358, 1362
n.6 (1982) (citation omitted). Put differently,
 
[t]he test to determine whether [a] defendant intended
to commit more than one offense in the course of a
 criminal episode is whether the evidence discloses one
general intent or discloses separate and distinct
intents. If there is but one intention, one general
impulse, and one plan, there is but one offense.
 
Ganal, 81 Hawai' i at 379, 917 P.2d at 391 (quoting State v.
Castro, 69 Haw. 633, 653, 756 P.2d 1033, 1047 (1988))(quotation signals omitted). 
Arceo, 84 Hawai' i at 18, 928 P.2d at 860 (brackets in original). 
Applying the test for a continuing offense, the supreme 
court has found that the following offenses qualify as continuing 
offenses: (1) first-degree murder, in violation of HRS § 707–701(1)(a) (1993), for intentionally or knowingly causing the death of more than one person in the same or separate incident, State v. Ganal, 81 Hawai' i 358, 378–79 & n.25, 384, 917 
P.2d 370, 390–91 & n.25, 396 (1996); (2) first-degree robbery, in violation of HRS § 708–840(1)(b) (1993), State v. Hoey, 77 Hawai'i 17, 38 & n.19, 881 P.2d 504, 525 & n.19 (1994); (3) 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
kidnapping, under certain circumstances, in violation of HRS 
§ 707–720(1)(c) (1993), id. at 38 & n.20, 881 P.2d at 525 & n.20;
 (4) theft of a firearm, in violation of HRS §§ 708–830(7) and 708–830.5(1)(b) (1993), Temple, 65 Haw. at 266–68, 650 P.2d at 1361–62; (5) theft of property by deception, in violation of HRS § 708–830(2) (1993), Martin, 62 Haw. at 367–69, 616 P.2d at 196–97; (6) second-degree terroristic threatening, in violation of HRS § 707-717(1) (1993), State v. Apao, 95 Hawai' i 440, 445­
48, 24 P.3d 32, 37-40 (2001); (7) attempted prohibited possession of a firearm, in violation of HRS §§ 134-7(b) (1993) and 705-500 (1993), State v. Valentine, 93 Hawai' i 199, 208-09, 998 P.2d 479, 
488-89 (2000); (8) attempted second-degree murder, attempted first- or second-degree assault, and first-degree reckless endangering, in violation of HRS §§ 707-701.5, 707-710, 707-711, 705-500, and 707-713 (1993), State v. Rapoza, 95 Hawai' i 321, 
330, 22 P.3d 968, 977 (2001); and (9) manufacturing a dangerous drug, in violation of HRS § 712-1241(1)(d) (Supp. 1999), State v. Kealoha, 95 Hawai' i 365, 376-78, 22 P.3d 1012, 1023-25 (App. 
2000). 
IV.
 
In light of these principles and precedents, we 
conclude, contrary to the Family Court, that abuse of a family or household member, in violation of HRS § 709-906(1), can be charged as a continuing course of conduct. Under Martin, the question of whether "a legislative purpose to prohibit a continuing course of conduct plainly appears," within the meaning of HRS § 701-108(4), turns on whether the language of the statutory offense "involve[s] conduct that can extend beyond isolated moments." Martin, 62 Haw. at 371, 616 P.2d at 198. In 
Martin, the Hawai' i Supreme Court concluded that theft by 
deception qualified as a "continuing course of conduct" offense under HRS § 701-108(4) because two elements of the offense, deception and the exercise of control over the property of another, "involve conduct that can extend beyond isolated moments[.]" Martin, 62 Haw. at 371-72, 616 P.2d at 198. 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Similarly, in this case, the "physical abuse" element of HRS §
 
709-906(1) involves conduct that can extend beyond isolated
 moments. 
The Family Court cited two bases for its conclusion
 
that the Legislature did not intend the offense of abuse of a
 family or household member to be charged on a continuous course
 of conduct theory: (1) the definition of physical abuse -- "to
 maltreat in such a manner as to cause injury, hurt or damage to
 the body"; and (2) the enhanced penalties for repeat offenders. 
However, the Family Court acknowledged that "[t]he term 'physical
 abuse' can be something that extends beyond isolated moments." 
Under Martin, an offense element that involves conduct that can
 extend beyond isolated moments supports the conclusion that the
 offense can be charged as a continuing course of conduct. We
 further conclude that the existence of enhanced penalties for
 repeat offenders does not show the Legislature's intent to
 preclude charging the offense as a continuing course of conduct. 
The enactment of enhanced penalties for repeat offenders reflects
 the Legislature's understanding that domestic violence often
 involves continuing and repeated acts of violence that pose
 particular danger for the past victim of the abuse. It reflects
 the Legislature's intent to provide increased punishment to deter
 those convicted of abuse of a family or household member from
 repeating their crime, rather than an intent to influence the
 State's charging decisions.
 
We agree with the State that the actions of the
 
Legislature are more indicative of an intent to permit the State
 to charge the offense as a continuing course of conduct. 
Amendments to HRS § 709-906 demonstrate the Legislature's and
 society's evolving understanding of domestic violence as a crime
 that has unique features because of the relationship between the
 perpetrator and victim, which may be long-lasting, and because
 the crime often involves repeated and continuous acts. For
 example, the Legislature has increased the time necessary to
 request expungement of records concerning the offense to the
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
point where expungement is prohibited because "the repetitive and 
retaliatory nature of domestic violence required accurate and complete documentation of a perpetrator's history for the safety of the victim and the victim's family." Supplemental Commentary on HRS § 709-906 (Supp. 2011) (citing S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1553, in 1997 Senate Journal, at 1480). The Legislature's extension of the cooling-off period is also indicative of its recognition of the recurring and repetitive nature of domestic violence. See HRS § 709-906(4) (Supp. 2011) and Supplemental 
Commentary on HRS § 709-906; State v. Kapela, 82 Hawai' i 381, 
389-91, 922 P.2d 994, 1002-04 (App. 1996) (discussing the legislative history of the cooling-off period). We hold that Family Court erred in concluding that the Legislature did not intend the offense of abuse of a family or household member to be charged on a continuous course of conduct theory. 
Furthermore, abuse of a family or household member can 
qualify as a continuing offense under the standards established by the Hawai' i Supreme Court. The physical abuse of a family or 
household member over a period of time can be based on one general intent, impulse, and plan. See Arceo, 84 Hawai' i at 18, 
928 P.2d at 860; Martin, 62 Haw. at 368-69, 616 P.2d at 196-97. 
The State generally has wide discretion in bringing
 
criminal charges. See State v. Radcliffe, 9 Haw. App. 628, 639­
40, 859 P.2d 925, 932 (1993); United States v. Batchelder, 442
 U.S. 114, 124 (1979) ("Whether to prosecute and what charge to
 file or bring . . . are decisions that generally rest in the
 prosecutor's discretion."). Here, in opposition to Decoite's
 motion to dismiss, the State proffered evidence that during the
 period alleged in the complaint, Decoite had engaged in
 continuous and repeated acts of violence against the CW, as well
 as expert testimony that abusive relationships involve a pattern
 and cycle of violence in which the batterer is attempting to
 exercise power and control over his or her partner. Under the
 circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the State's charge
 against Decoite for violating HRS § 709-906(1) as a continuous
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
course of conduct was impermissible. Our conclusion is supported
 
by California cases which have determined that crimes similar to
 HRS § 709-906(1) could be charged as continuous course of conduct
 offenses. See People v. Thompson, 206 Cal. Rptr. 516, 519-20
 
(Cal. Ct. App. 1984) (concluding that spouse abuse, like child
 abuse, can be charged as a continuing course of conduct); People
 v. Hamlin, 89 Cal. Rptr. 3d 402, 415-17 (Cal. Ct. App. 2009)
 (concluding that the offense of torture, like spouse, child, and 
animal abuse, could be charged as a continuous course of
 conduct).
 
Of course, to avoid being barred by the statute of
 
limitations, the State will have to prove that Decoite committed
 the alleged offense through a course of conduct which continued
 into the limitations period. Based on the existing record, we
 cannot say that the State will be unable to meet this burden. 
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Order
 
Dismissing Complaint and remand the case for further proceedings
 consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.
