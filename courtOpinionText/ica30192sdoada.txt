IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MARVIN C.F. CREWS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-09-036739)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Marvin C.F. Crews (Crews) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, entered on January 7, 2010 in the District Court
 of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).
1 Crews
 
was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in violation of Hawaii
 Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-105(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (2007). 
On appeal, Crews contends that the District Court erred 
by admitting a speed check card into evidence because the State failed to adduce the requisite foundation required by State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai
'i 354, 227 P.3d 520 (2010), and therefore, 
there was insufficient evidence to convict him of Excessive Speeding.
2 
The State admits that there was insufficient foundation
 
to admit the speed check card into evidence under Fitzwater, and,
 therefore, insufficient evidence to convict Crews of Excessive
 Speeding without the speedometer reading. However, the State
 
1
 The Honorable Leslie A. Hayashi presided.
 
2
 The District Court admitted the speed check card over Crews's
objection on the ground of lack of foundation.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
contends, without elaboration, that the case should be remanded
 
to the District Court for entry of a judgment against Crews for
 violating HRS ยง 291C-102, a non-criminal traffic violation of
 speeding.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Crews's point of error as follows:
 
The State failed to establish how and when the speed 
check was performed, including whether it was performed in the manner specified by the manufacturer of the equipment used to perform the check, and the identity and qualifications of the person performing the check. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai
'i at 376-77, 
227 P.3d at 542-43. Therefore, there was insufficient foundation to admit the speed check card into evidence. Without admission of the speed check card into evidence, there was insufficient evidence to convict Crews of Excessive Speeding. 
There was also insufficient evidence to find that Crews
 
was speeding. Unlike Fitzwater, Crews did not admit to driving
 at any speed because he did not testify. Other than Officer
 Lucas's testimony regarding his inadmissible speedometer reading,
 the State adduced no evidence of Crews's speed. Therefore, there
 was insufficient evidence to find that Crews was speeding.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment entered on January 7,
 2010, in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu
 Division, is reversed.
