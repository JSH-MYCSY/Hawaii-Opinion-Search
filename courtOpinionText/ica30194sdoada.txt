 The Honorable Leslie Hayashi presided.  1NO. 30194
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v.
EXAVIER A. BROWN, Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1DTC-09-033198)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth, Ginoza, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Exavier A. Brown (Brown) appeals
from the Judgment filed on October 26, 2009, in the District
Court of the First Circuit (district court).1  Brown was
convicted of excessive speeding, in violation of Hawaii Revised
Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-105(a)(1) (2007 & Supp. 2009). 
Brown's conviction was predicated on a police officer's
testimony regarding the speed reading from a laser gun used to
measure the speed of Brown's vehicle.  Brown objected to the
officer's testimony regarding the laser gun's speed reading on
the ground of lack of foundation.  The district court overruled
the objection.
On appeal, Brown argues that the district court erred
in convicting him because: 1) the prosecution failed to lay a
sufficient foundation to support the admission of the officer's
testimony regarding the speed reading from the laser gun; and 2)
without that testimony, there was insufficient evidence to prove
the charged offense of excessive speeding.  
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai# i (State) concedes
that pursuant to State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai# i 204, 216 P.3d 1227
(2009), it failed to lay an adequate foundation to support the
admission of the officer's testimony because it failed to adduceNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2sufficient evidence to show that the officer's training in the
operation of the laser gun met the requirements indicated by the
manufacturer.  The State therefore agrees with Brown that Brown's
excessive speeding conviction cannot stand.  The State, however,
contends that there was sufficient evidence to prove that Brown
committed the traffic infraction of "simple" speeding, in
violation of HRS ยง 291C-102(a)(1) (2007), and the State requests
that we remand the case for entry of judgment on this traffic
infraction.
We resolve the issues raised on appeal as follows:
1.  We conclude that pursuant to Assaye, the State
failed to lay a sufficient foundation to support the admission of
the officer's testimony regarding the speed reading from the
laser gun.  Without that testimony, there was insufficient
evidence to convict Brown of excessive speeding.
2. Contrary to the State's contention, we further
conclude that without the officer's testimony regarding the speed
reading from the laser gun, there was insufficient evidence to
prove that Brown committed the traffic infraction of "simple"
speeding, in violation of HRS ยง 291C-102(a)(1).
Accordingly,  
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the October 26, 2009,
Judgment of the district court is reversed.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, September 9, 2010.
