 Kersh appeals individually but also attempts to appeal as "assignee"
on behalf of Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff-Appellant Metro Club Inc.
(Metro), the corporation for which Kersh had been president. Because Kersh is not licensed to practice law in Hawai' i and "a corporation cannot appear and
represent itself either in proper person or by its officers," Oahu Plumbingand Sheet Metal, Ltd. v. Kona Constr., Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 374, 590 P.2d 570,572 (1979), Metro Club Inc. is precluded from participating in this appealwithout an attorney. Id. at 380, 590 P.2d at 576.

March 25, 1997. The Order of Dismissal dismissed the case with 
prejudice, noting there had been no court activity since April 
26, 1985. The effect of the dismissal was to preclude the State 
of Hawai' i Office of Consumer Protection (the State) from 
pursuing any claims from the December 3, 1980 complaint filed against Metro Club or Kersh. 
It is unusual for a defendant to appeal the dismissal
 
of a case against him and curiously, in his prayer for relief,
 
Kersh asks this court to "order the lower court to dismiss the
 
lawsuit against him." Incongruent as Kersh's action is, it
 
appears he wants his day in court to raise issues set forth in
 
his "Questions Presented:"
3
 
(1) Did the lower court acquire personal jurisdiction
 
over Kersh and/or Metro?
 
(2) Did the State break the corporate veil by suing
 
Kersh individually for alleged acts committed by [Metro]?
 
(3) Was there any legal basis for filing this lawsuit
 
or was it a sham lawsuit to be used as a lever to illegally put
 
Kersh and Metro Passbook Inc[.] out of business in Hawaii?
 
(4) Should Judge Crandall have disqualified herself
 
from acting in this case?
 
On appeal, Kersh fails to point to the record where the
 
alleged errors occurred and were objected to, in violation of
 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). He also fails
 
to provide any record references, in violation of HRAP Rule
 
28(b)(3). This court could refuse to consider Kersh's appeal as
 
a sanction for his noncompliance. HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) ("Points
 
not presented in accordance with this section will be
 
disregarded[.]"). However, because we adhere to a policy of
 
hearing a case on its merits when possible, we review this case
 
3
 Although the section "Questions Presented" has no place in an
appellate brief, we treat this section as Kersh's effort to provide "[a]
concise statement of the points of error." HRAP Rule 28(b)(4).

for any meritorious claims. Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 
Hawai'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Kersh's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
This action was first filed on December 3, 1980. On
 
4
March 30, 1984, the circuit court  filed an Order of Dismissal
because there had been no court activity since January 18, 1982,
 over two years earlier. On April 12, 1984, the State objected
 
and the Order of Dismissal was withdrawn. On September 28, 1984,
 
the State filed its pre-trial statement. Trial was set for the
 
week of April 15, 1985. On November 21, 1984, the State filed a
 
motion to continue the trial date to May 6, 1985. 
On April 26, 1985, the State filed an amended pre-trial
 
statement. There was no further activity in the case for nearly
 
5
twelve years. On March 25, 1997, the circuit court  again
dismissed the case for lack of prosecution, this time with
 
prejudice, because the last court activity took place on
 
April 26, 1985.
 
On May 2, 1997, Kersh filed a "Motion to Set Aside
 
Dismissal of Lawsuit; to Order Clerk's Office to Provide Summons
 
and to Permit the Filing of an Amended Counter Claim and Third
 
Party Claims." 
On April 11, 2001, almost four years later, Kersh
 
filed his "Amended Motion to Set Aside the Dismissal of this
 Case, to Permit an Amended Counter and Third Party Complaint and
 
to Permit the Issuance of Summons." On June 19, 2001, the
 
circuit court filed its "Order Denying Defendant Kersh's Amended
 
Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal to Permit an Amended
 
Counter and Third Party Complaint and to Permit the Issuance of

Summons" (Order Denying Amended Motion). On July 6, 2001, Kersh
 
appealed the Order Denying Amended Motion. The ICA affirmed the
 
circuit court's order in a memorandum opinion. State v. Metro
 
Club, Inc. et al, No. 24392 (App. April 2, 2003) (mem.). 
On October 21, 2009, more than six years after the
 
ICA's affirmation of the circuit court's Order Denying Amended
 Motion, Kersh filed a nonhearing motion in the circuit court for
 
the entry of a final judgment on the order. 
On November 12, 2009, the circuit court entered its Order of
 
Final Judgment, stating simply "The Court having dismissed this
 
lawsuit on March 25, 1997 now enters its separate order of final
 
judgment in this case." It is from this Order of Final Judgment
 
that Kersh appeals.
 
We review the circuit court's dismissal for abuse of
 
discretion. Compass Dev., Inc. v. Blevins, 10 Haw. App. 388,
 
397-98, 876 P.2d 1135, 1340 (1994). "To constitute an abuse, the
 appellant must show that the trial court clearly exceeded the
 
bounds of reason . . . to the substantial detriment of a party
 
litigant." Hawaii Auto. Retail Gasoline Dealers Ass'n, Inc. v.
 
Brodie, 2 Haw. App. 99, 101, 626 P.2d 1173, 1175 (1981). 
The court's power to dismiss a case for lack of
 
prosecution "is necessary in order to prevent undue delays in the
 disposition of pending cases and to avoid congestion[.]" Link v.
 
Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 629, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1388 (1962). 
However, "[d]ismissals with prejudice are not favored and
 
appellate courts will uphold such a sanction by the trial court
 
only when there is a clear record of delay . . . and where lesser
 
sanctions would not serve the best interests of justice.‚Äù 
Richardson v. Lane, 6 Haw. App. 614, 619, 736 P.2d 63, 67 (1987)
 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
 
In this case, there is a clear record of delay. The
 
State filed its complaint on December 3, 1980, over thirty years
 
ago. Over three years later, on March 30, 1984, the circuit
 
court dismissed the case for lack of prosecution. The State, as
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
plaintiff, objected and the circuit court reinstated the case. 
On March 25, 1997, after nearly twelve more years, the circuit
 
court again dismissed the case for lack of prosecution. At the
 
time of the second dismissal, there had been a delay of over
 
sixteen years since the complaint was first filed. The circuit
 
court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed the case for
 
lack of prosecution.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order of Final Judgment
 
entered on November 12, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First
 Circuit is affirmed.
