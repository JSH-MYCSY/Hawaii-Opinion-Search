NO. 30201
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN THE MATTER OF THE CONSERVATORSHIP AND GUARDIANSHIP OF
 
RUTH C. SCUPHOLM, Respondent
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CG NO. 07-1-0012)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Appellant Kathleen M.S. Mikatich (Mikatich) appeals 
from the "Stipulated Order Granting Petition for Approval of 
Final Account, Termination of Conservatorship and Discharge of 
Conservator, Filed February 6, 2009," which was entered on 
October 29, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(Circuit Court).1 Mikatich asserts that the Circuit Court erred 
by: (1) failing to find that the conservator of Ruth Scupholm's estate had a conflict of interest in multiple proceedings 
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 560:5-423 (2006) and 
Rule 42 of the Hawai' i Probate Rules (HPR); (2) determining that 
Mikatich was not an "interested party" under HRS § 560:1–201 (2006); (3) failing to enforce HRS § 560:5-431 (2006), which 
requires the conservator to file a final report and petition for 
discharge within sixty days of the death of the protected person; 
(4) relying on hearsay pleadings to justify granting the
 
conservator's petition to compromise the claims of a settlement
 
agreement; (5) approving the settlement agreement as a
 
compromised claim which did not benefit the protected person,

diminished her estate, and prevented her estate from being opened
 
pursuant to HRS § 560:5-425 (2006); (6) not finding that Chester
 
Scupholm was the victim of undue influence by a non-related,
 
third party and that he was not mentally incompetent at the time
 
by reason of repeated strokes and heavy medication thereby
 
voiding the new will; (7) not finding that Chester Scupholm's
 
bank accounts held in joint tenancy with Ruth Scupholm were
 
severed and extinguished when Chester Scupholm unilaterally
 
closed their joint accounts; and (8) allowing the conservator and
 
the other parties to reverse their positions regarding the
 
validity of Chester Scupholm's will in violation of the doctrine
 
of judicial estoppel.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Mikatich's points of
 
error as follows:
 
(1) As a preliminary matter, Appellees Karen Meredith 
(Meredith) and Jeffrey Moreira (Moreira) contend that Mikatich's 
opening brief does not comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). They point out that Mikatich fails to (1) state where in the record the errors occurred; (2) 
provide a quotation of the grounds urged for the objection and 
the full substance of the evidence admitted or rejected when the 
point involves the admission or rejection of evidence; or (3) 
provide either a quotation of the finding or conclusion urged as 
error or reference to appended findings and conclusions when the 
point involves a finding or conclusion of the court or agency. 
Mikatich's observation that the brief contains numerous record 
citations misses the point: HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) requires specific 
information to be provided and the opening brief does not contain 
it. While Mikatich accurately states that her brief is not as 
bad as those in the cases cited by Meredith and Moreira, it does 
not follow that Mikatich's brief complies with HRAP 
Rule 28(b)(4). 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Pursuant to HRAP Rule 28(b)(4), points not presented in 
accordance with the section may be disregarded, and none of 
Mikatich's asserted points of error comply with the rule. 
Accordingly, it is within the court's discretion to disregard the 
opening brief. See Sprague v. Cal. Pac. Bankers & Ins. Ltd., 102 
Hawai'i 189, 195, 74 P.3d 12, 18 (2003). 
On the other hand, Hawai' i courts are reluctant to 
dispose of a case on such grounds, even when multiple violations appear in an opening brief. See, e.g., Housing Fin. & Dev. Corp. 
v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111-12 (1999) 
(addressing the merits of certain issues even though the 
appellant's opening brief did not comply with HRAP 
Rules 28(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(9)). Instead, the Hawai' i 
judiciary "has consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity 'to have their cases heard on the 
merits, where possible.'" Morgan v. Planning Dept., 104 Hawai' i 
173, 180-81, 86 P.3d 982, 989-90 (2004) (quoting O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 
(1994)). Also supporting a decision on its merits, Meredith and Moreira do not state that they were prejudiced by Mikatich's 
failure to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4). See Laeroc Waikiki 
Parkside, LLC v. K.S.K. (Oahu) Ltd. P'ship, 115 Hawai' i 201, 212, 
166 P.3d 961, 972 (2007) (noting that appellees did not claim 
prejudice as part of its determination to not dismiss the appeal 
for failing to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)). 
However, Mikatich's counsel -- Gary Y. Shigemura,
 
Randall N. Harakal, Joyce M. Brown, and Stuart M. Cowan -- are
 
warned that, pursuant to HRAP Rule 51, future non-compliance with
 
HRAP Rule 28(b) may result in sanctions against them.
 
(2) All of Mikatich's points of error hinge on her
 
2
being an "interested person," as defined by HRS § 560:1-201,  in
Ruth Scupholm's estate because Mikatich otherwise lacks standing
 
2
 Section 560:1-201 states that an "'interested person' includes
heirs, devisees, children, spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, creditors,
beneficiaries, and any others having a property right in or claim against a
trust estate or the estate of a decedent, ward, or protected person."

to bring the lawsuit. See In re Estate of Damon, 109 Hawai' i 
502, 512, 128 P.3d 815, 825 (2006); see generally Waters of Life 
Local Sch. Bd. v. Charter Sch. Review Panel, 126 Hawai' i 183, 
186, 268 P.3d 436, 439 (App. 2011). Given the terms of HRS § 560:1-201, Mikatich's contention that she is an "interested 
person" in Ruth Scupholm's estate depends on Mikatich 
establishing that she has a property right in or claim against 
the estate. 
In an earlier related proceeding, this court affirmed
 
the Circuit Court's denial of Mikatich's motion to intervene in a
 
lawsuit resolving a dispute regarding Ruth Scupholm's estate
 
because Mikatich failed to establish that any property owned
 
separately by Chester Scupholm (Ruth Scupholm's deceased husband
 
and Mikatich's father) was the subject of the lawsuit. Meredith
 
v. Rapisora, 127 Hawai' i 241, 277 P.3d 335, No. 29148, 2012 WL 
1951329, at *3 (App. May 31, 2012) (sdo). We further observed 
that the proper place for Mikatich to assert her interests in 
Chester Scupholm's estate was the separate probate proceeding 
regarding his estate which was then pending and in which she was 
represented by counsel. Id. Similar reasoning applies in this 
case. To have a property interest in or claim against Ruth Scupholm's estate, Mikatich first must establish that she has an 
interest in some property that passed to Ruth Scupholm's estate 
from Chester Scupholm's estate. As this court stated in the 
earlier related case, probate issues related to Chester 
Scupholm's estate are properly raised in a probate proceeding for 
Chester Scupholm's estate. Id.; see generally HRS § 560:3-107 
(2006). 
Moreover, a Hawai' i Supreme Court decision addressing 
the parameters of an "interested person" supports the conclusion that Mikatich is not an "interested person" in Ruth Scupholm's 
probate proceeding. In Damon, the decedent's will provided for a 
distribution of income generated by a trust and then, after the 
last death of the decedent's then-living children and 
grandchildren, the distribution of the corpus of the trust. 109 
Hawai'i at 505, 128 P.3d at 818. In relevant part, one of the 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
decedent's grandchildren sought to participate in a probate 
controversy regarding the distribution of the corpus of the trust 
but the court determined that the grandchild lacked standing. 
Id. at 511, 128 P.3d at 824. The grandchild argued that she had 
standing because (1) she was an "interested person" under HRS 
§ 560:1-201 and (2) her estate planning (i.e., how much she 
planned to bequeath to her children) would depend on how much of 
the trust corpus would be inherited by her children. Id. The 
Hawai'i Supreme Court rejected the grandchild's argument, holding 
that she fell outside the scope of HRS § 560:1–201 and lacked 
standing as an interested party to participate in the 
determination of the residuary beneficiaries of the trust because 
she did not have a property right or claim against the estate and 
her interest was too distant to the specific subject of the 
probate proceeding. Id. at 512, 128 P.3d at 825; see also In re 
Estate of Campbell, 106 Hawai' i 453, 459 106 P.3d 1096, 1102 
(2005) (holding that an "interested person" only includes those 
with a financial interest in an estate). In other words, Damon 
requires an individual to have a present property interest or 
claim in the property that is the subject of the probate 
proceeding. As applied to the instant case, Mikatich 
acknowledges that there are numerous questions -- all pertaining 
to Chester Scupholm's estate -- that would have to be answered 
before she would be able to establish that she has a claim 
against Ruth Scupholm's estate. 
Finally, Mikatich's legal citations are not persuasive. 
Notwithstanding Mikatich's conclusory assertion to the contrary,
 
the facts in In re Estate of Girod, 64 Haw. 580, 645 P.2d 871
 
(1982), are not similar to the facts in this case because, in
 
Girod, the individuals who did not receive notice were the heirs
 
of the decedent whose will was offered for probate in the
 
underlying proceeding. 64 Haw. at 580-81, 645 P.2d at 871-72. 
Here, neither Chester Scupholm's estate nor his will is the
 
subject of the probate proceeding from which Mikatich appeals and
 
Mikatich does not argue that she is Ruth Scupholm's heir. 
Accordingly, Girod does not support Mikatich's contention that
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the Circuit Court erred in its determination that Mikatich is not
 
an interested party in the probate proceedings dealing with Ruth
 
Scupholm's estate.3 Mikatich's citation to Campbell is not
 
apposite because a presumption regarding judicial openness only
 relates to access to proceedings, not standing to participate. 
The out-of-jurisdiction cases cited by Mikatich are not
 
controlling and do not provide any insight into whether Mikatich
 
is an "interested person" with a present property claim against
 
Ruth Scupholm's estate.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the appeal from the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit's October 29, 2009 "Stipulated Order
 Granting Petition for Approval of Final Account, Termination of
 
Conservatorship and Discharge of Conservator, Filed February 6,
 
2009," is dismissed.

 To the extent Mikatich's argument pertains to being entitled to
notice regarding the settlement agreement, the notice issue was determined in
the earlier proceeding before this court. See Meredith, 2012 WL 1951329, at
 
*3-*4.
