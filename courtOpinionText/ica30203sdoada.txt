SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant State of Hawai' i (State) appeals 
from the First Amended Final Judgment (First Amended Judgment)
 
filed on November 12, 2009, in the Circuit Court of the Fifth
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1
Circuit (Circuit Court),  pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure Rule 54(b) (2000). 
The First Amended Judgment was 
based on the Circuit Court's "Order Granting in Part and Denying 
in Part Defendant State of Hawaii's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Against Defendant Kilauea Irrigation Company, Inc. (Duty to Defend)" (Partial Summary Judgment Order). As explained below, we vacate the First Amended Judgment to the extent that it entered judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Kilauea Irrigation Company, Inc. (Kilauea Irrigation), and we remand for further proceedings. 
I.
 
The State moved for partial summary judgment against 
Kilauea Irrigation, arguing that Kilauea Irrigation had a duty to defend the State against claims raised in lawsuits (Underlying Lawsuits) filed in the aftermath of the March 14, 2006, breach of the Kaloko Dam on Kaua
'i. The State asserted that Kilauea 
Irrigation had a duty to defend the State in the Underlying Lawsuits based on a provision of a water permit (Revocable Permit No. RP-6240/S-6240) the State had issued to Kilauea Irrigation. The permit granted Kilauea Irrigation rights and privileges relating to the Kaloko Ditch, including the "[r]ight, privilege and authority to develop and utilize government waters from government land at Papaa within the Moloaa Forest Reserve, together with the right to construct, operate, repair and maintain a water transportation system within the [Kaloko] Ditch Right of Way and Puu Ka Ele Stream." The permit also provided that Kilauea Irrigation shall: 
[a]t all times with respect to the Premises use due care for
public safety and agrees to defend, hold harmless and
indemnify the State of Hawaii from and against all claims or
demands for damage, including claims for property damage,
personal injury or death, arising on or about the Premises,
or by any fire or explosion thereon, or growing out of, or
caused by any failure on the part of the Permittee to
maintain the Premises in accordance with the terms and
 
conditions of this Permit . . . .

In its Partial Summary Judgment Order, the Circuit
 
Court granted the State's motion in part and denied it in part,
 
and the Circuit Court subsequently entered the First Amended
 Judgment based on its rulings in the Partial Summary Judgement
 Order. The Circuit Court entered final judgment "in favor of the
 State and against Kilauea [Irrigation] as to the State's cross-
claim for a declaration that Kilauea [Irrigation] is obligated to
 defend the State regarding allegations relating to the State's
 premises or property ownership in the [Underlying Lawsuits]." 
The Circuit Court also entered final judgment 
in favor of Kilauea [Irrigation] and against the State
regarding the State's cross-claim for a declaration that
Kilauea [Irrigation] is obligated to defend the State
regarding allegations in the Underlying [Lawsuits] relating
to the State's statutory obligations that: (1) the State of
Hawaii knew since 1982 that [Kaloko] Dam was structurally
questionable but never required C. Brewer Properties, Inc.
to repair the Dam; (2) the State never informed the
plaintiffs in the Underlying [Lawsuits] that the [Kaloko]
Dam's structure was questionable; and (3) the State
authorized an inexperienced and under capitalized public
utility company to operate, inspect, maintain and repair the
irrigation system and failed to oversee and failed to
intervene when it became clear that the company was not
meeting its obligations.
 
II.
 
On appeal, the State challenges the Circuit Court's
 
partial denial of the State's motion for partial summary
 
judgment. Based on Pancakes of Hawaii, Inc. v. Pomare Properties
 Corp., 85 Haw. 286, 944 P.2d 83 (App. 1997), the State argues
 that "because the Circuit Court determined that [Kilauea
 Irrigation] is obligated to defend the State on one allegation
 (relating to the State's premises or property ownership),
 [Kilauea Irrigation] is obligated to defend the State against all
 allegations against the State in the Underlying [Lawsuits]."
 
Kilauea Irrigation did not file an answering brief and
 
therefore does not present any challenge to the arguments raised
 by the State on appeal. Kilauea Irrigation also did not cross-
appeal from the Circuit Court's entry of judgment in favor of the
 State on the State's claim that Kilauea Irrigation had a duty to
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
defend the State regarding allegations in the Underlying Lawsuits
 
relating to the State's premises or property ownership. We
 therefore assume, for purposes of this appeal, that the Circuit
 Court was correct in determining that Kilauea Irrigation was
 obligated to defend the State regarding allegations in the
 Underlying Lawsuits relating to the State's premises or property
 ownership.
 
In Pancakes, Sofos Realty Corporation and Lee Carter 
(collectively, "Sofos") had an agreement with Pomare Properties Corporation (Pomare) that required Pomare to "indemnify, defend and hold [Sofos] harmless from and against" certain claims. Pancakes, 85 Hawai' i at 289 n.2, 292, 944 P.2d at 86 n.2, 89. 
Sofos was sued on claims that were covered and claims that were not covered under this agreement.
2 With respect to the duty to 
defend, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Sofos and ruled that Pomare had a duty to defend Sofos against all claims raised in the lawsuit. Id. at 289, 944 P.2d at 86. 
Pomare appealed. 
On appeal, this court affirmed the trial court's grant
 
of summary judgment with respect to Pomare's duty to defend. Id.
 
at 288, 299-300, 944 P.2d at 85, 96-97. In discussing the duty
 to defend, this court stated that "[w]e can discern no logical
 reason why the duty to defend based on indemnity contracts should
 not follow the same philosophy used in the insurance context." 
Id. at 291-92, 944 P.2d at 88-89. Although the focus of our
 discussion was the complaint allegation rule, we also cited the
 insurance principles that: (1) "the duty to defend is much
 broader than the duty to pay claims"; and (2) "'where a suit
 raises a potential for indemnification liability of the insurer
 to the insured, the insurer has a duty to accept the defense of
 the entire suit even though other claims of the complaint fall
 
2This court's opinion in Pancakes makes clear that the claims against
Sofos for fraudulent misrepresentations and fraudulent failure to disclose
were claims that were not covered by the agreement between Pomare and Sofos.Pancakes, 85 Hawai' i at 297, 944 P.2d at 94.

outside the policy's coverage.'" Id. at 291, 944 P.2d 88 (block
 
quote format and citations omitted).
 
Based on Pancakes, we conclude that the Circuit Court
 
erred in ruling that Kilauea Irrigation had no duty to defend the
 
State in the Underlying Lawsuits regarding the allegations that:
 "(1) the State of Hawaii knew since 1982 that [Kaloko] Dam was
 structurally questionable but never required C. Brewer
 Properties, Inc. to repair the Dam; (2) the State never informed
 the plaintiffs in the Underlying [Lawsuits] that the [Kaloko]
 Dam's structure was questionable; and (3) the State authorized an
 inexperienced and under capitalized public utility company to
 operate, inspect, maintain and repair the irrigation system and
 failed to oversee and failed to intervene when it became clear
 that the company was not meeting its obligations." 
III.
 
We vacate the First Amended Judgment to the extent that
 
it entered judgment in favor of Kilauea Irrigation, and we remand
 the case for further proceedings consistent with this Summary
 Disposition Order.
