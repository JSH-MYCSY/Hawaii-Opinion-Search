NO. 30207
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN THE INTEREST OF LK
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 06-11094)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Appellant-Mother (Mother) appeals from the Order
 
Awarding Permanent Custody filed on November 18, 2009, in the
 
Family Court of the First Circuit (Family Court).1
 In the Order
 
Awarding Permanent Custody, the Family Court, 
inter alia, granted
 
Petitioner-Appellee Department of Human Resource's (DHS's) Motion
 
for Order Awarding Permanent Custody and Establishing a Permanent
 
Plan for Mother's child (LK), divested Mother of her parental and
 
custodial duties and rights over LK, and awarded permanent
 
custody of LK to DHS. The Order Awarding Permanent Custody was
 
based in part on findings that Mother was not presently willing
 
and able to provide LK with a safe family home, even with the
 
assistance of a service plan, and that it was not reasonably
 
foreseeable that she would be able to do so within a reasonable
 
period of time. The Family Court found that DHS's proposed

Permanent Plan (Permanent Plan), which included the ultimate goal
 
of adoption, was in LK's best interests.
 
On appeal, Mother argues that the Family Court erred in
 
finding that she could not provide a safe family home for LK,
 
even with the assistance of a service plan, presently and/or
 
within a reasonable amount of time. In addition, with reference
 
to the Family Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
 
filed on January 6, 2010, Mother contends that Findings of Fact
 
(FOFs) 71, 84, 85, 111-118, and 144-47 are not supported by
 
substantial evidence, and that Conclusions of Law (COLs) 9-11 are
 
based on erroneous FOFs and should, therefore, be set aside.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve the Mother's points of error as follows:
 
The Family Court did not clearly err in determining, 
pursuant to Hawai 'i Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 587-73(a) (2006), 
that Mother was not willing and able to provide a safe family 
home for LK and would not become willing and able to do so within 
a reasonable period of time. Although Mother contests FOFs 71, 
84, 85, 111-118, and 144-47, with the exception of FOFs 116-117, 
Mother does not offer any argument or support for the contention 
that the FOFs are clearly erroneous. Based on the Family Court's 
undisputed FOFs, including FOFs 48-51, 76-80, 90-94, 99, 102-110, 
133-141, challenged FOFs which are not argued on appeal, 
including 84-85, 111-118, and 144-147, and the substantial 
evidence in the record, including the testimony given at trial 
and DHS's Safe Family Home Report, FOFs 116-17 are not clearly 
erroneous and COLs 9-11 are not wrong. See In re Doe, 95 Hawai 'i 
183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) (setting forth standards of review of FOFs and COLs in cases concerning HRS ยง 587-73(a)). 
It is undisputed that Mother's step-father sexually
 
abused her from the time she was in third grade to the time she
 
2 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
was in eighth grade, which resulted in her pregnancy with LK when
 
she was only fourteen years old. There is evidence that this
 
experience and her young age contributed to her inability to
 
effectively parent LK, and Mother is clearly deserving of
 
sympathy. However, Mother has not identified any authority
 
supporting her argument that Family Court erred in not applying a
 
different standard in this case because of Mother's own history
 
of abuse. The record on appeal reveals that, in acknowledgment
 
of Mother's young age and difficult circumstances, DHS waited
 
nearly two years longer than it typically would have to move for
 
permanent custody of LK, to give Mother a chance to develop her
 
parenting ability and participate in therapy for sexual abuse. 
However, as stated above, the record in this case supports the
 
Family Court's decision to terminate Mother's parental rights.
 
For these reasons, the Family Court's November 18, 2009
 
Order Awarding Permanent Custody is affirmed.
