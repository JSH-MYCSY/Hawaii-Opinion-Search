STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JONAH POMAIKALANI MOKULEHUA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Honolulu Division)
(CASE NO. 1DTA-08-10135)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jonah Pomaikalani Mokulehua 
(Mokulehua) appeals from the Judgment filed on October 16, 2009, 
in the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).1/  
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) charged Mokulehua 
with operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2012). 
The OVUII charge failed to allege an essential element 
-- that Mokulehua operated his vehicle "upon a public way, street, road, or highway" (public-road element). State v. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 392, 219 P.3d 1170, 1179 (2009) 
(quoting HRS § 291E-1 (2007)). Mokulehua's offense was tried on stipulated facts, which included that Mokulehua's vehicle was

stopped by the police at a "roadblock in the Monsarrat Avenue at
 
the Waikiki Shell area[.]" At the close of the State's case-in­chief, Mokulehua moved for judgment of acquittal on the ground
 that the OVUII charge was defective because it failed to allege
 the public-road element. He renewed this motion after resting
 without presenting any evidence. The District Court denied both
 motions and found Mokulehua guilty as charged of OVUII. 
I.
 
On appeal, Mokulehua argues that: (1) the OVUII charge
 
was defective because it failed to allege the public-road
 element; and (2) the District Court erred in denying his motion
 to suppress evidence, which was based on his claim that the
 roadblock was not legally conducted. Mokulehua contends that his
 "conviction should be reversed for failure to properly charge or
 due to illegal roadblock."
 
In State v. Apollonio, SCWC-11-0000695, slip op., 2013 
WL 5574921 (Hawai' i Oct. 10, 2013), the Hawai' i Supreme Court 
recently held that an excessive speeding charge which omitted the requisite state of mind "cannot be 'reasonably construed to state an offense.'" Id. at 12, 2013 WL 5574921, at *5 (citation and 
brackets omitted). In that case, defense counsel contended in closing argument that the excessive speeding statute required the State to prove that the defendant recklessly traveled thirty miles per hour faster than the speed limit, and the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the charge for the first time in his application for writ of certiorari to the supreme court. Id. 
at 6-9 & n.5, 2013 WL 5574921 at *2-3 & n.5. Because the supreme court concluded that the excessive speeding charge could not be reasonably construed to state an offense, it vacated the defendant's conviction and remanded the case with instructions that the case be dismissed without prejudice. Id. at 12-13, 25, 
2013 WL 5574921, at *5, 10. 
Based on Apollonio, we conclude that Mokulehua's OVUII
 
charge, which omitted the public-road element, could not be
 reasonably construed to state an offense. We therefore vacate

Mokulehua's conviction and remand the case with instructions to
 
dismiss the charge without prejudice. Id. Given our decision on
 
Mokulehua's claim that his charge was defective, we do not
 address his claim that the District Court erred in denying his
 motion to suppress evidence. 
II.
 
We vacate the District Court's Judgment and remand the
 
case with instructions to dismiss the OVUII charge without
 prejudice.
