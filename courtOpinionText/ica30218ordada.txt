IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
vs.
 
STEPHEN R.K. RAMOS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CASE NO. 2P109-00972)
 
ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT-APPELLANT STEPHEN R.K. RAMOS'S
 
MOTION FOR ORDER CORRECTING OR STRIKING FOOTNOTE 2 OF THE
 
UNPUBLISHED MEMORANDUM OPINION, FILED APRIL 27, 2011
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the "Motion for Order Correcting or
 
Striking Footnote 2 of the Unpublished Memorandum Opinion, filed
 
April 27, 2011" (Motion for Order Correcting or Striking Footnote
 2), and the records and files herein,
 
Defendant-Appellant requests that we issue an order
 
correcting Footnote 2 by adding the further history of the Notice
 of Appeal or, in the alternative, striking Footnote 2 in its
 entirety. 
We acknowledge Defendant-Appellant's attempt to
 
address the issue created by the Notice of Appeal by filing his
 "Motion to Permit Addition of Count II to Appeal" (Motion for
 Addition). That attempt is already part of the record in this
 case. More importantly, the Motion for Addition does not affect
 the validity of our observation that "[m]ore careful attention in 
  
                                   preparing the notice of appeal would have obviated our need to
 
address [the jurisdictional] issue."
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion for Order
 
Correcting or Striking Footnote 2 is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 13, 2011.
