OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DONIMIC T. BROOKS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0276K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Donimic T. Brooks (Brooks or
 
1
Defendant) appeals from the Third Amended Judgment  filed on
2
April 6, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit  (circuit
1
 Brooks was charged with and convicted of, inter alia, Theft in the
First Degree under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-830.5(1)(a). However,
the "CHARGE(S) TO WHICH DEFENDANT CONVICTED" section of the Third Amended
Judgment erroneously sets forth the HRS section number for Theft in the First
Degree as § 708-831(1)(a). The circuit court is hereby ordered to file a
Fourth Amended Judgment, nunc pro tunc, correcting the HRS section number for
Theft in the First Degree to § 708-830.5(1)(a).

court). On August 28, 2009, a jury found Brooks guilty of
 
Burglary in the First Degree (Count 1), in violation of Hawaii
 
3
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-810(1)(c) (1993),  and Theft in the
First Degree (Count 2), in violation of HRS §§ 708-830(1) (Supp.
 
2010) and 708-830.5(1)(a) (Supp. 2010).4
 
On appeal, Brooks contends:
 (1) Potential juror number 3 was improperly dismissed.
 
(2) The circuit court erroneously admitted evidence of
 
alleged threats made by Brooks towards prosecution witness Joshua
 
Stuck (Stuck).
 
(3) The circuit court erred when it did not allow
 
evidence of alleged threats made to Brooks by Patricia Merschdorf
 
(Patricia) and her daughter, Erika Fritts (Fritts).
 
(4) The circuit court erroneously prevented Brooks
 
from attacking Stuck's credibility.

 HRS § 708-810(1)(c) provides:
 
§708-810 Burglary in the first degree.  (1) A person
commits the offense of burglary in the first degree if the person
intentionally enters or remains unlawfully in a building, with
intent to commit therein a crime against a person or against
property rights, and:
 
. . . .
 
(c)	 The person recklessly disregards a risk that the
building is the dwelling of another, and the building
is such a dwelling.
4
 HRS §§ 708-830(1) and 708-830.5 provide in relevant part:
 
§708-830 Theft.  A person commits theft if the person does
any of the following:
 
(1)	 Obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property.
A person obtains or exerts unauthorized control over
the property of another with intent to deprive the
other of the property.
 
§708-830.5 Theft in the first degree.  (1) A person commits
the offense of theft in the first degree if the person commits
theft:
 
(a)	 Of property or services, the value of which exceeds
$20,000[.]

(5) The circuit court erred when it improperly
 
excluded testimony of Patricia's untruthfulness because Defense
 
Counsel failed to lay a proper foundation.
 
(6) The circuit court erred when it refused to permit
 
introduction into evidence of Patricia's asset and debt statement
 
from her divorce case.
 
(7) The circuit court erroneously restricted cross-
examination of the fingerprint technician.
 
(8) The circuit court erred when it imposed a Crime
 
Victim Compensation fee.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Brooks's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
when it excused potential juror number 3 because potential juror 
number 3 maintained that she could not convict Brooks. State v. 
Kauhi, 86 Hawai' i 195, 199, 948 P.2d 1036, 1040 (1997). 
(2) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion 
when it allowed evidence of Brooks's threats made towards Stuck because it "is well-established that evidence of threats or 
intimidation is admissible under Rule 404(b) to show a 
defendant's consciousness of guilt." State v. Smith, 91 Hawai' i 
450, 459, 984 P.2d 1276, 1285 (App. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
(3) The circuit court did not err when it excluded
 
evidence of alleged threats made by Patricia or Fritts towards
 
Brooks after the burglary. The alleged threats were not relevant
 
because they did not make the burglary "more probable or less
 
probable." Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 401.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) Brooks contends he was "prevented from attacking
 
Stuck's bias, interest, and motive arising from his status as a
 
felony probationer, on grounds that HRE Rule 404(b) required
 
prior notice of such an attack." Brooks also contends the
 
circuit court abused its discretion when it denied his requests
 
to ask Stuck about possible drug use at the time of the robbery
 
or at the time Stuck made his statements. 
The circuit court did not prohibit Brooks from asking
 
Stuck about Stuck's felony probation due to a lack of prior
 
notice under HRE Rule 404(b); the circuit court denied Brooks's
 
requests because "the balance of [Brooks's] proposed questions
 
are –- the prejudice outweighs the probative value." The circuit
 
court found "in its discretion that the balance of trying to
 
establish some sort of bias under 609.1 is met by the limitations
 
expressed." The circuit court stated:
 
[Defense Counsel], should you wish to inquire of
Mr. Stuck, the Court will place these limitations on your
questioning. Specifically you may not mention that he was
on probation nor mention any specific charges that he was
facing.
 
You are permitted to inquire regarding the plea
agreement that was reached, specifically whether the plea
agreement included any exchange for his testimony in this
case, whether he knew he was facing a possible and
substantial prison sentence at the time of making any
statements or at the time of his testimony, and whether he
had any specific discussions with the state or police
regarding any exchange, any statements in exchange for pleas
or leniency.
 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it
 
limited Brooks's cross-examination of Stuck to any possible plea
 
agreement with the State. 
The Sixth Amendment is satisfied where sufficient
 
information is elicited to allow the jury to gauge
adequately a witness'[s] credibility and to assess his or
her motives or possible bias. When the trial court excludes
 evidence tending to impeach a witness, it has not abused its
discretion as long as the jury has in its possession
sufficient information to appraise the biases and
motivations of the witness.

State v. Balisbisana, 83 Hawai' i 109, 114, 924 P.2d 1215, 1220 
(1996) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets 
omitted). 
Finally, Brooks did not present any evidence that (a) 
Stuck was using drugs near or at the time of the incident, (b) 
Stuck was using drugs near or at the time he made his statements, 
or (c) such alleged drug use affected his perception or 
recollection at the time of the incident or at the time he made 
his statements. Therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion when it denied Brooks's request to question Stuck 
about possible drug use. State v. Sabog, 108 Hawai' i 102, 111, 
117 P.3d 834, 843 (App. 2005) (A defendant may cross-examine a witness as to the witness's drug use "at or near the time of the 
incident to the extent that it affected [the witness's] 
perception or recollection of the alleged event."); State v. 
Sugimoto, 62 Haw. 259, 263, 614 P.2d 386, 390 (1980) ("A witness 
may not be questioned as to his involvement with drugs solely to 
show that he is unreliable or lacks veracity."). 
(5) Brooks contends it was error for the circuit court
 
to prohibit Defense Counsel's question posed to Lickiss: "Do you
 
have any opinion as to [Patricia's] reputation for truthfulness?" 
Defense Counsel did not lay a proper foundation because she did
 
not establish that Lickiss was familiar with Patricia's
 
reputation for truthfulness. Therefore, the circuit court did
 
not err when it sustained the Prosecutor's objection based on
 
lack of foundation. HRE Rule 104(a); State v. Faafiti, 54 Haw.
 
637, 643, 513 P.2d 697, 702 (1973). 
(6) Brooks contends the circuit court, under HRE Rule
 
613(b), should have allowed him to introduce Patricia's asset and
 
debt statement from her divorce. Rule 613(b) provides in
 
relevant part:
 
Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a
witness is not admissible unless, on direct or cross­
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
examination, (1) the circumstances of the statement have
been brought to the attention of the witness, and (2) the
witness has been asked whether the witness made the
 statement.
 
In the circuit court, Brooks tried to introduce the statement
 
into evidence under HRE Rule 608(b):
 
Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the
purpose of attacking the witness'[s] credibility, if
probative of untruthfulness, may be inquired into on cross-
examination of the witness and, in the discretion of the
court, may be proved by extrinsic evidence.
 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion when, under HRE 
608(b), it refused to admit the statement into evidence. Defense 
Counsel did not try to admit the statement into evidence under 
HRE 613(b). State v. Moses, 102 Hawai' i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 
947 (2003) ("As a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, that argument will be deemed to have been 
waived on appeal; this rule applies in both criminal and civil 
cases."). Furthermore, Brooks did offer to redact the statement, 
and most of it was irrelevant. See State v. Ortiz, 91 Hawai' i 
181, 194 n.15, 981 P.2d 1127, 1140 n.15 (1990). Finally, assuming arguendo that it was error for the circuit court not to 
admit the asset and debt statement into evidence, Hawai' i Rules 
of Penal Procedure Rule 52(a) provides, in relevant part, that "[a]ny error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not 
affect substantial rights shall be disregarded." 
(7) Brooks contends the defense was erroneously
 
precluded from re-cross-examining the fingerprint technician
 
concerning the accuracy of a fingerprint match in an unrelated
 
case. Defense Counsel withdrew her question after the circuit
 
court sustained an objection from the State that the question was
 
beyond the scope of redirect. Assuming, arguendo, that this
 
point was preserved for appeal, it is without merit, and
 
assuming, arguendo, there was error, it was harmless.

(8) The circuit court did not err when it ordered
 
Brooks to pay $210.00 to the Crime Victim's Compensation Fund. 
Brooks did not object to the amount of the fee or state that he
 
was unable to pay it, and we find no plain error.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Third Amended Judgment of
 
Conviction and Sentence filed on April 6, 2010 in the Circuit
 Court of the Third Circuit is affirmed.
