OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LAWRENCE K. ROGERS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 

 (CASE NO. 2DTA-08-00807)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Lawrence Kenneth Rogers (Rogers)
 
appeals the November 12, 2009 order entered in the District Court
 
of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division (District Court) that:
 
(1) granted the State's request to reconsider the District
 
Court's September 14, 2009 order arresting an August 13, 2009
 
judgment of conviction against Rogers and (2) reinstated the
 
judgment of conviction (Reconsideration Order).1
 
On August 13, 2009, a Notice of Entry of Judgment 
and/or Order and Plea/Judgment was entered convicting Rogers of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a) (Supp. 
2007). On September 10, 2009, upon Roger's timely motion, 
pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 34, the 
District Court entered an Order Granting Motion to Arrest 
1/
 The Honorable Kelsey T. Kawano presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Judgment, filed August 24, 2009. On November 12, 2009, upon the
 
State's timely motion, the District Court entered the
 
Reconsideration Order. Rogers timely appealed.
 
On appeal, Rogers raises a single point of error, i.e., 
that the District Court erred in granting the State's motion of reconsideration because the complaint failed to allege that 
Rogers was driving his vehicle upon a public way, street, road, 
or highway at the time of the offense, which rendered the charge 
deficient pursuant to State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai
'i 383, 393, 219 
P.3d 1170, 1180 (2009).2 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Rogers's points of error as follows:
 
The District Court’s November 12, 2009 Reconsideration
 
Order is vacated, and this case is remanded to the District Court 
for dismissal of the OVUII charge without prejudice.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
'i, March 14, 2011.

 The State failed to address the substance of the sole point of
error on appeal. Instead, the State argues that the Reconsideration Order
should be remanded because of a mistyped date. Irrespective of clericalerrors, it is the intent and substance of the document that controls. SeeState v. Poohina, 97 Hawai' i 505, 509-10, 40 P.3d 907, 911-12 (2002). The
intent of the Reconsideration Order is clear. The clerical error in the Reconsideration Order is not material. The State cites no legal authority forits request to file a supplemental brief "if the instant case is allowed toproceed" and we find none.
