NO. 30223
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TRUMAN LEE KETCHMARK, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 1DTI-09-020487)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR
LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant Truman Lee
Ketchmark (Appellant Ketchmark), pro se, has asserted from the
Honorable Gerald H. Kibe's August 20, 2009 order and notice of
entry of order in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai #i
(Appellee State) and against Appellant Ketchmark with respect to
a citation for violating a pedestrian-control signal in violation
of Hawai# i Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 291C-33 (2007).
The August 20, 2009 order ended the trial de novo for
Appellant Ketchmark's citation for violating a pedestrian-control
signal in violation of HRS ยง 291C-33, leaving nothing further for
the district court to accomplish.  Therefore, the August 20, 2009
order is an appealable final order under HRS ยง 641-1(a).
However, Appellant Ketchmark's appeal from the
August 20, 2009 order is not timely, because Appellant Ketchmark
did not file his December 7, 2009 notice of appeal within thirty
days after entry of the August 20, 2009 order, as required
pursuant to Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-Therefore, we lack jurisdiction over Appellant Ketchmark's
untimely appeal.  
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, March 24, 2010.
