OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JUNE GABRIEL, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
EWA DIVISION
 
(CRIMINAL CASE NO. 1P308-1024)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant June Gabriel (Gabriel) appeals from
 
the Judgment filed on November 4, 2009 in the District Court of
 
1
the First Circuit, Ewa Division  (district court).  After a bench
 
trial, the district court convicted Gabriel of Harassment, in

 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 711-1106(1)(b)
 
(Supp. 2008).2
 
1
 Per diem District Court Judge T. David Woo, Jr., presided.

 HRS § 711-1106(1)(b) provides:
 
§711-1106 Harassment.  (1) A person commits the offense of
harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other
person, that person:
 
. . . .
 
(b)	 Insults, taunts, or challenges another person in a
manner likely to provoke an immediate violent response
or that would cause the other person to reasonably
believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury
(continued...)

On appeal, Gabriel contends:
 
(1) The district court erred in convicting him because 
there was insufficient evidence adduced at trial to prove that his remarks to Complainant were outside the ambit of free speech 
protected by the United States and Hawai
'i Constitutions. 
(2) Because the district court concluded that Gabriel
 
had "a reckless and criminal intent to harass" Complainant, the 
court reversibly erred by applying the incorrect state of mind to
 
the offense of Harassment under HRS § 711-1106(1)(b).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Gabriel's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) Gabriel's statements to Complainant were not
 
protected by the United States or Hawai 'i Constitutions because 
they were true threats. 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court has held that a "statement 
that amounts to a threat to kill would not be protected by the
 First Amendment." State v. Chung, 75 Haw. 398, 415-16, 862 P.2d
 
1063, 1072 (1993) (internal quotation marks, citation, brackets,
 and ellipsis omitted). In State v. Valdivia, 95 Hawai
'i 465, 24 
P.3d 661 (2001), the Hawai 'i Supreme Court stated that 
a remark threatening bodily injury ceases to be
constitutionally protected and ripens into a "true threat"
when it is objectively susceptible to an interpretation that
could induce fear of bodily injury in a reasonable
recipient, at whom the remark is directed and who is aware
of the circumstances under which the remark was made,
because those circumstances reflect that the threatening
remark was so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and
specific as to the person threatened, that it conveyed a
gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution. 
Id. at 475-76, 24 P.3d at 671-72 (internal quotation marks,
 
citation, and brackets omitted).

of the recipient or another[.]

Gabriel argues that the district court erred in
 
convicting him when the evidence was not sufficient to prove his
 
remarks were "true threats." The record contains sufficient
 
evidence to support Gabriel's conviction under HRS § 711­
1106(1)(b).  "On appeal, the test to ascertain the legal
 
sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in
 
the light most favorable to the State, there is substantial
 
evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State
 
v. Lima, 64 Haw. 470, 475, 643 P.2d 536, 539 (1982) (internal
 quotation marks and citation omitted). 
The record contains sufficient evidence to support the
 
district court's holding that (1) Gabriel (a) with the intent to
 
harass, annoy or alarm Complainant (b) did insult, taunt, or
 
challenge Complainant (c) in a manner that did in fact cause
 
Complainant to believe that Gabriel intended to cause bodily
 
injury to her or her boyfriend or damage to Complainant's or her
 
boyfriend's property; and (2) Gabriel's statements would cause a
 
reasonable person to believe that he intended to cause bodily
 
injury to Complainant.
 
(2) The district court did not apply the wrong state
 
of mind to Gabriel's Harassment conviction under HRS § 711­
1106(1)(b). In In re Doe, 76 Hawai
'i 85, 869 P.2d 1304 (1994), 
the Hawai 'i Supreme Court stated: 
Inasmuch as "the intent to harass, annoy, or alarm
another person must be proved" in order to establish the
offense of harassment in violation of HRS § 711-1106(1)(b),
 
see commentary on HRS § 711-1106, at 273 (emphasis added),
and no contrary purpose "plainly appears" on the face of the
statute, it therefore follows that "intent" is the requisite
state of mind for each of the elements set forth in HRS
 § 711-1106(1)(b). And, "pursuant to HRS § 702-205 (1985),
that state of mind applies to such conduct, attendant
circumstances, and results of conduct as are specified by
the definition of the offense." [State v. Chung, 75 Haw.
398, 411 n.8, 862 P.2d 1063, 1070 n.8 (1993)].
 
Id. at 92, 869 P.2d at 1311 (brackets in original and footnote
 
omitted).
 
In support of his argument, Gabriel cites to State v. 
Pesentheiner, 95 Hawai 'i 290, 22 P.3d 86 (App. 2001).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pesentheiner knocked off a police officer's hat while being
 
escorted off the field of a Pro Bowl football game, id. at 292,
 
22 P.3d at 88, and was charged with Harassment under HRS § 711­
1106(1)(a) (Supp. 2000) for offensively touching a police
 
officer. Pesentheiner, 95 Hawai 'i at 291, 22 P.3d at 87. The 
issue on appeal was whether the district court "failed to heed
 
the express mens rea requirement of HRS § 711-1106(1)(a) -- the
 
'intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person[.]'" 
Pesentheiner
, 95 Hawai 'i at 299, 22 P.3d at 95. This court held: 
The [district] court's ruling raises genuine concern
as to whether it properly applied the intent standard of HRS
§ 711-1106(1)(a) to the case below. Though the court
referred to Pesentheiner's conduct as "intentional," we
hesitate to place too great a weight on a singular, isolated
utterance, when other language in the court's ruling clearly
indicates an erroneous understanding of the requisite mens
 rea.
 
As Pesentheiner amply notes, most confounding in the
court's analysis of his state of mind is its reasoning that
"when you elect to wave your hands when you're being
escorted off, you're as reckless as you would be in an
assault case, and as far as this Court's concerned,
intentional, whether it's specific intent or just general
intent."
 
We agree with Pesentheiner that the [district] court's
use of the term "reckless" to describe his conduct puts his
conviction in grave tension with the intent element of HRS
§ 711-1106(1)(a). While we acknowledge (as the court
appeared to) that a reckless state of mind is minimally
sufficient for an assault conviction, nothing less than the
"intent to harass, annoy, or alarm" specified in the statute
could suffice in this case.
 
Id. at 300, 22 P.3d at 96 (footnote omitted). Pesentheiner is
 
distinguishable from the instant case because the record in the
 
instant case indicates that the district court understood the
 
mens rea requirement of 711-1106(1)(b):
 
This resulted –- the court finds that, infers from
 
these statements that [Gabriel] intended to intimidate and
 
create fear on the part of [Complainant], which in fact –­
and the court finds that these statements had their intended
 
effect which produced fear on the part of [Complainant]. 
. . . .
 
The court finds that there was reckless and criminal
 
intent to harass, that [Gabriel] made insulting, taunting,
or challenging statements to a person that was likely to
provoke a violent response or that would cause the person to
reasonably –- well, that these statements were intended to

cause [Complainant] to believe that [Gabriel] intended to
 
cause bodily injury to the recipient or damage property of
another person.
 
(Emphasis added.) The district court held that Gabriel's speech 
was intended to create fear of bodily injury or property damage 
and his statements had their intended effect, which is contrary 
from Pesentheiner where "other language in the court's ruling 
clearly indicates an erroneous understanding of the requisite 
mens rea." 95 Hawai 'i at 300, 22 P.3d at 96. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
 
November 4, 2009 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Ewa
 Division, is affirmed.
