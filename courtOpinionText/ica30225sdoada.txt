LAHAINA DIVISION
 
(DC-CIVIL NO. 09-1-1872)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Wayne Peelua (Peelua), appeals from
 
the Judgment for Possession and Writ of Possession issued in
 
favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Deutsche Bank National Trust Company,
 
as Trustee under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement Relating to
 
Impac Secured Assets Corp., Mortgage Pass-through Certificates,
 
Series 2007-2 (Deutsche Bank), filed on November 18, 2009 in the
 
District Court of the Second Circuit, Lahaina Division (District
 
Court).1
 
1 The Honorable Barclay MacDonald presided at the hearing on Peelua's
Motion To Dismiss and the Honorable Rhonda Loo presided at trial.
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Peelua contends on appeal that: (1) the District Court 
lacked jurisdiction in this matter pursuant to Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 604-5(d) (2010) because he properly raised the 
issue of title to the subject property; and (2) Deutsche Bank 
does not possess a certificate of authority pursuant to HRS § 
414-432, which he claims is necessary to conduct business in the 
State of Hawai' i. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Peelua's points of error as follows:
 
(1) We review Peelua's first point of error de novo. 
Aames Funding Corp. v. Mores, 107 Hawai' i 95, 98, 110 P.3d 1042, 
1045 (2005). A motion to dismiss is reviewed based on the 
contents of the complaint, however, a trial court "is not 
restricted to the face of the pleadings, but may review any 
evidence, such as affidavits and testimony, to resolve factual 
disputes concerning the existence of jurisdiction." Id. (quoting 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 94 Hawai' i 330, 337, 13 P.3d 1235, 
1242 (2000)). 
Based on Peelua's Motion to Dismiss, filed on July 30,
 
2
2009,  along with his affidavit attached to the Motion to
Dismiss, Peelua satisfied Rule 12.1 of the District Court Rules
 of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) in properly asserting "a defense to
 
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action, or
 
one in which the title to real estate is involved[.]" DCRCP Rule
 
12.1
 (2010). 
HRS § 604-5(d) provides, in relevant part, that "[t]he
 
district courts shall not have cognizance of real actions, nor
 actions in which the title to real estate comes in question[.]" 
In turn, DCRCP Rule 12.1 requires:
 
2
 Peelua filed his Motion to Dismiss contemporaneously with his answer
to the complaint.
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Pleadings.  Whenever, in the district court, in
defense of an action in the nature of an action of trespass
or for the summary possession of land, or any other action,
the defendant shall seek to interpose a defense to the
jurisdiction to the effect that the action is a real action,
or one in which the title to real estate is involved, such
defense shall be asserted by a written answer or written
motion, which shall not be received by the court unless
accompanied by an affidavit of the defendant, setting forth
the source, nature and extent of the title claimed by
defendant to the land in question, and such further
particulars as shall fully apprise the court of the nature
of defendant's claim.
 
(emphases added). In his Motion to Dismiss, Peelua alleged that
 
the District Court did not have jurisdiction in this matter, and
 
that he was the owner of the subject property, which "consists of
 
family lands which have been owned by the Peelua family for
 
generations, including the present ownership by the Defendant." 
Peelua's affidavit further stated in part that:
 
5. I am the owner of the Property identified in the
Complaint filed in this matter. Because of time
 
constraints, I cannot file a copy of my Deed to the property
with the affidavit, but I will furnish a copy of the Deed as
soon as I can.
 
6. The Property identified in the Complaint
consists of lands which have been owned by the Peelua family
(my family) for generations, going back to the time of the
Great Mehele [sic].
 
. . .
 
8. The Property has passed down through my family over
time, and it was eventually deeded to me by my family.
 
At the hearing on Peelua's Motion to Dismiss, the
 
District Court explained that it was denying the motion because
 
Peelua "has not provided any deed or any colorable instrument of
 
title to the Court." Under DCRCP Rule 12.1, however, there is no
 
requirement that a deed or instrument of title be provided to the
 
District Court. See also Brown v. Koloa Sugar Co., 12 Haw. 409,
 
411 (Haw. Terr. 1900) (under similar previous rule pertaining to
 district court jurisdiction, plea and affidavit were held
 
sufficient to establish that district court did not have
 
jurisdiction). Rather, the rule requires an affidavit from the
 
defendant stating "the source, nature and extent of the title
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claimed" by the defendant. Peelua's affidavit satisfied the
 
requirements of DCRCP Rule 12.1. Similar to the defendant's
 
affidavit submitted in Monette v. Benjamin, 52 Haw. 246, 473 P.2d
 
864 (1970), Peelua stated the source of his title as being from
 
his family. Moreover, his affidavit stated that the property was
 
deeded to him. As noted in Monette: "The source, nature and
 
extent of the title could have been described more precisely. 
But failure to do so, did not make the affidavit deficient." Id.
 
at 248, 473 P.2d at 865.
 
Deutsche Bank points to Aames, arguing that, like the 
affidavit in Aames, Peelua's affidavit was insufficient to meet the requirements of DCRCP Rule 12.1. As to title, however, the 
declaration in Aames simply asserted in a conclusory fashion that 
title was at issue. 107 Hawai' i at 99-100, 110 P.3d at 1046-47. 
The declaration in Aames also raised issues about the manner in which the mortgage in that case had been consummated, but the 
court noted that "[n]one of these matters, however, are germane 
to informing the court as to the 'source,' 'nature,' and 'extent' 
of the title claimed by the [defendants] as to the land in 
question." Id. Therefore, Aames is distinguishable. 
At the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, Deutsche Bank
 
pointedly relied on a quitclaim deed attached to its verified
 
complaint, and it appears the District Court may have considered
 
that deed in its decision to deny the motion. DCRCP Rule 12.1
 
does not provide for consideration of counter-affidavits or
 
counter-evidence. To the extent the District Court considered
 
the quitclaim deed in deciding the Motion to Dismiss, it was in
 
effect ruling on a question of title. Monette, 52 Haw. at 250,
 
473 P.2d at 866.
 
Finally, we disagree with Deutsche Bank's assertion
 
that this appeal is moot because Peelua has vacated the property
 and Deutsche Bank is in possession of the property. Unlike the
 
cases cited by Deutsche Bank, this case does not involve the
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
filing of a lis pendens and there is no assertion or indication 
in the record that the property has been sold to a third-party. 
See Lathrop v. Sakatani, 111 Hawai' i 307, 313-14, 141 P.3d 480, 
486-87 (2006); IndyMac Bank v. Miguel, 117 Hawai' i 506, 521, 184 
P.3d 821, 836 (App. 2008). 
For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the
 
District Court lacked jurisdiction in this matter. HRS § 604­
5(d).
 
(2) In light of our conclusion that the District Court
 
did not have jurisdiction in this matter, we do not have
 
jurisdiction to consider the merits of Peelua's second point of
 
error on appeal. Gilmartin v. Abastillas, 10 Haw. App. 283, 296,
 
869 P.2d 1346, 1352 (1994).
 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment for
 
Possession and the Writ of Possession, both issued in favor of
 Deutsche Bank on November 18, 2009 in the District Court of the
 
Second Circuit, Lahaina Division, are vacated and the case is
 
remanded with instructions to dismiss the case for lack of
 
jurisdiction.
