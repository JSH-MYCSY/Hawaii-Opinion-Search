IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
REGINALD BOTELHO, Claimant-Appellant,
v.
 
ATLAS RECYCLING CENTERS, LLC and
HAWAII EMPLOYERS' MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY,
Employer/Insurance Carrier-Appellee
and
 
SPECIAL COMPENSATION FUND, Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2009-334(H) (1-06-00818))
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
The Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial 
Relations (Director) assessed attorney's fees against Employer-
Appellee Atlas Recycling Centers, LLC (Atlas) and Insurance Carrier-Appellee Hawaii Employers' Mutual Insurance Company Inc. (collectively, "Employer") and in favor of Claimant-Appellant Reginald G. Botelho (Botelho), pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-93(a) (1993). 
The Labor and Industrial 
Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) issued a Decision and Order, which reversed the Director's decision to assess attorney's fees against Employer. Relying on this court's unpublished summary disposition order in Kelly v. Metal-Weld Specialties, Inc., Nos. 27127 & 27208, 2008 WL 4409419 (Hawai' i App. Sept. 30, 2008), the NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
LIRAB concluded that HRS § 386-93(a) did not authorize the
 
assessment of attorney's fees. 
The version of HRS § 386-93 applicable to this case,
 
HRS § 386-93 (1993 & Supp. 2011), provided:
 
§ 386-93 Costs. (a) If the director of labor and
industrial relations, appellate board or any court finds
that proceedings under this chapter have been brought,
prosecuted, or defended without reasonable ground the whole
costs of the proceedings may be assessed against the party
who has so brought, prosecuted, or defended the proceedings. 
(b) If an employer appeals a decision of the director
or appellate board, the costs of the proceedings of the
appellate board or the appellate court, together with
reasonable attorney's fees, shall be assessed against the
employer if the employer loses; provided that if an employer
or an insurance carrier, other than the employer who
appealed, is held liable for compensation, the costs of the
proceedings of the appellate board or the appellate court,
together with reasonable attorney's fees, shall be assessed
against the party held liable for the compensation. 
(Emphasis added.) In Kelly, we construed the phrase "whole costs
 
of the proceedings" in HRS § 386-93(a) as not including
 attorney's fees, noting the Legislature's specific reference to
 both attorney's fees and costs in HRS § 386-93(b) and the lack of
 a specific reference to attorney's fees in HRS § 386-93(a). 
On appeal, Botelho argues that our interpretation of 
the phrase "whole costs of the proceedings" in Kelly was erroneous because we overlooked decisions of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawai' i that had construed the phrase "whole 
cost of the proceedings" in the predecessor statutes to HRS § 386-93(a) as including attorney's fees. We agree that we erred. Upon further review and based on the decisions of the Supreme Court of the Territory of Hawai' i in Ilaga v. Yuen Lin 
Ho, 35 Haw. 591 (Hawai' i Terr. 1940), and Rivas v. Curtis, 38 
Haw. 405 (Hawai' i Terr. 1949), we conclude that HRS § 386-93(a) 
(1993) authorizes the assessment of attorney's fees. We therefore vacate the LIRAB's Decision and Order, which was filed on November 16, 2009, and we remand the case for further proceedings.

We note that in 2012, the Hawai' i Legislature amended 
HRS § 386-93(a) to provide as follows (new material underscored 
and repealed material in brackets): 
(a) If the director of labor and industrial relations,
appellate board, or any court finds that proceedings under
this chapter have been brought, prosecuted, or defended
without reasonable ground, the whole costs of the
proceedings including reasonable attorney's fees may be
assessed against the party who has [so] brought, prosecuted,
or defended the proceedings.
 
2012 Haw. Sess. L. Act 234, § 1 at 810.1 This amendment, which
 
took effect on July 1, 2012, makes clear that HRS § 386-93(a)
 
authorizes the assessment of attorney's fees for proceedings
 after July 1, 2012. Id. § 3 at 810.
 
BACKGROUND 
Botelho was employed as a laborer by Atlas, and his job
 
involved the repeated bundling and tying of bales of scrap metal.
 Botelho suffered a work-related left carpal tunnel syndrome
 injury. On January 30, 2007, the Director issued a decision
 
(Director's Decision), which found that Employer had accepted
 
liability for Botelho's injury. The Director's Decision ordered
 Employer to pay medical benefits required by the nature of
 Botelho's injury and reserved determination of Botelho's "average
 weekly wages, temporary disability, permanent disability and/or
 disfigurement." 
After the issuance of the Director's Decision, Botelho 
was unsuccessful in obtaining temporary total disability (TTD)
 benefits from Employer despite repeated requests for payment.
 Botelho requested a hearing on the matter. On May 15, 2009, the
 Director issued a Supplemental Decision (Director's Supplemental
 Decision), which (1) ordered Employer to pay: (a) all medical

 The legislative history of the 2012 amendment indicates that the
legislation was in response to this court's ruling in Kelly and was intended
to "clarify" that attorney's fees are included in the costs that may be
assessed under HRS § 386-93(a). See Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 50-12, in 2012 House
Journal, at 1624; S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2935, available at

care, services, and supplies required by the injury; (b)
 
$1,409.59 in TTD benefits and additional TTD upon receipt of
 medical certification; (c) $281.92 as a 20% penalty under HRS 
§ 386-92 (Supp. 2012) for failure to pay TTD; and (d) a $2,500
 penalty payable to the Special Compensation Fund pursuant to HRS
 § 386-31(b) (Supp. 2011); and (2) assessed attorney's fees and
 costs against Employer pursuant to HRS § 386-93(a).
 
On June 3, 2009, Employer appealed the Director's
 
Supplemental Decision to the LIRAB.  Among other things, Employer
 
challenged the Director's assessment of attorney's fees pursuant
 
to HRS § 386-93(a).  Employer filed a motion for partial summary
 
judgment as to the attorney's fees assessment, contending that
 
HRS § 386-93(a) did not authorize the Director to award
 attorney's fees. On November 16, 2009, the LIRAB issued its
 
Decision and Order, which granted Employer's motion for partial
 
summary judgment. The LIRAB, relying on this court's reasoning
 in Kelly, reversed the Director's Supplement Decision with
 respect to the assessment of attorney's fees, ruling that HRS 
§ 386-93(a) did not authorize the assessment of attorney's fees. 
Bothelho appeals from the LIRAB's November 16, 2009, Decision and
 Order.
 
DISCUSSION
 
I.
 
At the outset, we note that Employer argues that this
 
court lacks jurisdiction over Botelho's appeal because Employer
 contends that the LIRAB's Decision and Order, which reversed the
 Director's assessment of attorney's fees pursuant to HRS § 386­93(a), was not an appealable final order. We disagree.
 
In Lindinha v. Hilo Coast Processing Co., the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court concluded: 
[A]n order awarding or denying attorney's fees and costs
under HRS § 386–93(b) "determines a claimant's rights to
those benefits." . . . The imposition of attorney's fees and
costs has no bearing on any future award because the fees
and costs claimed are attributable to the issue which the
 employer has appealed. Consequently, the award of
attorney's fees and costs under HRS § 386–93(b) has no

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
bearing on any other matters. An award of attorney's fees
and costs, then, is final . . . for purposes of an appeal.
 
Lindinha, 104 Hawai' i 164, 169, 86 P.3d 973, 978 (2004) 
(citations omitted). 
Here, the LIRAB's Decision and Order completely and
 
finally determined Botelho's entitlement to attorney's fees
 
pursuant to HRS § 386-93(a) and this determination had no bearing
 on other unresolved matters in the case. Based on Lindinha, we
 conclude that the Decision and Order was an appealable final
 order.

II.
 
The issue presented in this appeal is whether the
 
phrase "whole costs of the proceedings," as used in the version
 of HRS § 386-93(a) applicable to this case, includes attorney's
 fees. We apply the following principles in interpreting a
 statute:
 
[When construing a statute] our foremost obligation is to
ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. And we must read
 statutory language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.
 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used in a
statute, an ambiguity exists.
 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning of the
ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context, with
which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences may be
compared, in order to ascertain their true meaning.
Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic aids in
determining legislative intent. One avenue is the use of
 legislative history as an interpretive tool.
 
This court may also consider the reason and spirit of
the law, and the cause which induced the legislature to
enact it to discover its true meaning.
 
2 We decline Employer's request that we dismiss Botelho's appeal because
Botehlo's opening brief did not strictly comply with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28 (2008). Employer asserts that Botelhofailed to list the authorities in his table of authorities in alphabeticalorder as required by HRAP Rule 28(b)(1). Employer also asserts that Botelho'sstatement of the case was deficient for omitting certain relevant facts andthat his points of error failed to fully quote all the disputed conclusions oflaw. We conclude that any non-compliance of Botelho's opening brief with HRAPRule 28 was not sufficient to warrant our dismissal of his appeal.

107 Hawai' i 178, 183, 111 P.3d 587, 592 (2005) (brackets, 
quotation marks, ellipsis points, and citation omitted).
 
In Kelly, we construed the phrase "whole costs of the
 
proceedings" in the version of HRS § 386-93(a) at issue here, as
 
not including attorney's fees. We relied upon the difference
 between the language in HRS § 386-93(a) and HRS § 386-93(b), as
 well as dicta from cases construing HRS § 386-93(b), which only
 referred to HRS § 386-93(a) as authorizing the assessment of
 costs. 
In Kelly, we reasoned as follows:
 
Unlike subsection (b) of HRS § 386-93, which refers to
"the costs of the proceedings . . . together with reasonable
attorney's fees," subsection (a) refers only to the "whole
costs of the proceedings." This disparity was present in
the original version of the statute when prior versions of
the statute were amended and subsections (a) and (b) were
reenacted together. See 1959 Haw. Sess. L. Act 241, §2, at
186; 1963 Haw. Sess. L. Act 116, § 1 at 122. The omission
 
of any reference to attorney's fees in subsection (a) of HRS
§ 386-93, coupled with the inclusion of a specific reference
to attorney's fees along with costs in subsection (b),
demonstrates that the Legislature did not intend to
authorize the assessment of attorney's fees under subsection
(a). 
We conclude that HRS § 386-93(a) does not authorize
the assessment of attorney's fees in addition to costs. See

Haw. 290, 296 n. 3, 660 P.2d 1316, 1321 n. 6 (1983) (noting

fees"); Survivors of Iida v. Oriental Imports, Inc.

Hawai'i 390, 403, 935 P.2d 105, 118 (App. 1997) (describing

party for frivolous appeals").
 
Kelly, Nos. 27127 & 27208, 2008 WL 4409419 at *7. 
However, the parties in Kelly did not cite Ilaga v.
 
Yuen Lin Ho or Rivas v. Curtis, two decisions of the Supreme
 
Court of the Territory of Hawai' i that construed the phrase 
"whole cost of the proceedings" as used in the 1935 and 1945
 predecessor statutes to HRS § 386-93(a), and we overlooked those
 cases in our analysis in Kelly. 
In Ilaga, 35 Haw. at 592, the claimant in a workers'
 
compensation action sought an award of attorney's fees against
 his employer pursuant to the Revised Laws of Hawai' i (RLH) § 7520 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(1935), which authorized the assessment of the "whole cost of the
 
proceedings" against a party who brought, prosecuted, or defended
 a proceeding without reasonable grounds. The employer conceded
 that the words "whole cost of the proceedings" were broad enough
 to include attorney's fees, but opposed the award of attorney's
 fees on the basis that it had reasonable grounds to prosecute its
 claims. Ilala, 35 Haw. at 592. The territorial supreme court
 
concluded that the employer had prosecuted its bill of exceptions
 without reasonable grounds and awarded attorney's fees in favor
 of claimant:
 
We having so concluded [that employer prosecuted its
claims without reasonable grounds] and counsel having
admitted that the words of the statute are sufficiently
broad to include attorney's fees, the motion for an award of
a reasonable attorney's fee for services rendered the
claimant in this court is therefore granted.
 
Id. at 594. 
In Rivas, 38 Haw. at 405-06, the territorial supreme
 
court addressed the request of a workers' compensation claimant
 
for attorney's fees pursuant to RLH § 4448 (1945), which was
 almost identical to the statute at issue in Ilaga (RLH § 7520
 (1935)). In Rivas, the court construed the phrase "whole cost of
 the proceedings" as used in RLH § 4448 to include attorney's
 fees. Rivas, 38 Haw. at 406. The court noted that it had
 
previously adopted this construction of the phrase in its 1940
 decision in Ilaga. Id. The court further stated that: "The
 
legislature in 1945 amended the section in other respects but did
 not see fit to qualify the construction theretofore made." Id.
 
After the territorial supreme court's decisions in
 
Ilaga and Rivas, the Legislature made numerous statutory
 amendments, including adding the language which would later
 become subsection HRS § 386-93(b). However, the statutory
 language for HRS § 386-93(a), including the use of the phrase
 "whole costs of the proceedings," has basically remained the
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
same.3 The Hawai' i Supreme Court has stated that "[w]here the 
legislature fails to act in response to our statutory 
interpretation, the consequence is that the statutory interpretation of the court must be considered to have the tacit approval of the legislature and the effect of legislation." State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai' i 495, 529, 229 P.3d 313, 347 (2010) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although our analysis in Kelly provides some support for construing the phrase "whole costs of the proceedings" in the version of HRS § 386­93(a) at issue as not including attorney's fees, we conclude upon further review and based on Ilaga and Rivas, that the phrase is more appropriately construed as including attorney's fees. 
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the LIRAB's
 
Decision and Order, and we remand the case for further
 proceedings consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.

3 The phrase construed in the predecessor statutes to HRS § 386-93(a) in
Ilaga and Rivas was "whole cost of the proceedings," while the phrase used in
HRS § 386-93(a) is "whole costs of the proceeding."
