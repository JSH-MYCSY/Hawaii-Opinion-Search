NO. 30232
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
CAPITAL ONE BANK (USA), N.A., Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
PATRICIA W. CARNABUCI, Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. DC CIV. 09-1-2669)
ORDER GRANTING MARCH 17, 2010 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Capital One Bank
(USA), N.A.'s (Appellee Capital One Bank), March 17, 2010 motion
to dismiss this appeal and (2) the record on appeal, we grant the
motion, but not on the ground assented by Appellee Capital One
Bank.  Appellee Capital One Bank argues that we should dismiss
the appeal because the jurisdictional statement of Defendant-
Appellant Patricia W. Carnabuci (Appellant Carnabuci) was
untimely.  We reject that argument because, it appears that we
lack jurisdiction over Appellant Carnabuci’s appeal from the
district court post-judgment proceedings, the Honorable Mimi
Desjardins presiding.  Appellant Carnabuci purports to appeal
from Appellee Capital One Bank’s November 16, 2009 "Declaration
of Judgment Creditor for Garnishment of Wages; Exhibits(s);
Notice to Employer of Judgment Debtor; Garnishee Information"
(the November 16, 2009 garnishment notice); however, the district
court has not yet entered a post-judgment order that is
appealable pursuant to Hawai# i Revised Statutes (HRS) 641-1(a)
(1993 & Supp. 2009).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-Pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993), appeals are allowed
in civil matters from all final judgments, orders, or
decrees of circuit and district courts.  In district court
cases, a judgment includes any order from which an appeal
lies.  A final order means an order ending the proceeding,
leaving nothing further to be accomplished.  When a written
judgment, order, or decree ends the litigation by fully
deciding all rights and liabilities of all parties, leaving
nothing further to be adjudicated, the judgment, order, or
decree is final and appealable.
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai# i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251,
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
omitted; emphases added).  The district court's October 13, 2009
judgment finally ended the proceedings for Appellee Capital One
Bank's complaint, and, thus, the October 13, 2009 judgment was
appealable pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a).  However, Appellant
Carnabuci did not file a timely appeal from the October 13, 2009
judgment.  Instead, Appellant Carnabuci seeks appellate review of
the post-judgment proceedings through which Appellee Capital One
Bank seeks to execute the October 13, 2009 judgment against
Appellant Carnabuci's wages by garnishing them.
"A post-judgment order is an appealable final order
under HRS § 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished."  Ditto v. McCurdy, 103
Hawai#i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 974, 978 (2003) (citation omitted). 
Thus, for example, the supreme court held that a post-judgment
"motion for return of garnished funds and for attorneys' fees and
costs constituted a post-judgment proceeding[,]" and,
consequently, the post-judgment order that "disposed all issues
raised in . . . [the] motion, [and, thus,] ended the post-
judgment proceeding regarding the request for return of the . . .
garnished funds and for attorneys' fees and costs . . . was
appealable under HRS § 641-1(a)."   Id. at 157-58, 80 P.3d at
978-79 (citations omitted).NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-3-"Correlatively, a[ post-judgment] order is not final
[and appealable] if the rights of a party involved remain
undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action." 
Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai# i at 157, 80 P.3d at 978 (citation
and internal quotation marks omitted).  For example, the supreme
court held that an order denying a post-judgment motion to quash
a garnishee summons is not an appealable post-judgment order
because such an order does not end that particular post-judgment
garnishment proceeding:
In this case, the circuit curt's denial of Garnishees'
motion to quash the garnishee summons is not a final order,
but simply an interlocutory step in the garnishment process. 
It did not terminate the garnishment proceedings.  Nor did
it finally adjudicate the rights of any party.  To the
contrary, the order perpetuated the proceedings.  It
determined that the summons was properly issued which
enabled the proceedings to continue.
Consequently, the order left pending several issues
regarding the ultimate fate of the preserved funds.  Further
proceedings are needed to determine whether Garnishees have
a right to setoff; whether there are conflicting claims to
the funds; and whether the funds may be applied to satisfy
the underlying judgment.  These determinations were to be
made at the garnishee proof hearing which was scheduled, but
never heard.
This appeal is premature and we dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction.  
Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Central Pacific Boiler & Piping,
Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 370, 714 P.2d 936, 938 (1986) (footnote
omitted).  Similarly in the instant case, the November 16, 2009
notice of intent to garnish wages does not end the post-judgment
garnishment proceeding.  The November 16, 2009 garnishment notice
is not even a district court order.  Instead, the November 16,
2009 garnishment notice merely perpetuates the post-judgment
garnishment proceedings by providing notice to Appellant
Carnabuci's employer of Appellee Capital One Bank's intention to
garnish Appellant Carnabuci's wages in order to satisfy theNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-4-October 13, 2009 judgment.  The district court has not yet
entered a garnishment order that commands Appellant Carnabuci's
employer to garnish Appellant Carnabuci's wages.  Consequently,
the November 16, 2009 garnishment notice is not an appealable
final post-judgment order under HRS § 641-1(a).   Absent a post-
judgment order that finally determines the post-judgment
proceeding, Appellant Carnabuci's appeal is premature, and, thus,
we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Capital One Bank's
March 17, 2010 motion to dismiss this appeal is granted, and
appellate court case number 30232 is dismissed for lack of
appellate jurisdiction.
