MYMAN O.K. SPARKS, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2668)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Myman O.K. Sparks (Sparks), pro se,
 
appeals from the Order of Dismissal of his "Motion to Proceed
 
with the Common Law of the Hawaiian Islands L1892 Chapter LVII,
 
Section 5," (Motion) filed November 17, 2009 in the Circuit Court
 
of the First Circuit (circuit court).1
 
On appeal, Sparks contends, inter alia, that the 
circuit court improperly dismissed his Motion, in which he had petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. In its Order of 
Dismissal, the court stated that "Writs of Habeas Corpus have 
been abolished in the State of Hawai' i in favor of Hawai[' ]i Rules 
of Penal Procedure [(HRPP)] Rule 40 petitions." The court dismissed the petition without prejudice to the filing of a Rule 
40 petition.

In his Motion, Sparks sought post-conviction relief 
based on his belief that he was illegally confined. Habeas 
corpus proceedings are encompassed within HRPP Rule 40. HRPP 
Rule 40(a). We review the denial of an HRPP Rule 40 petition de 
novo. See State v. De Guair, 108 Hawai' i 179, 187, 118 P.3d 662, 
670 (2005). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Sparks's appeal as follows:
 
Rather than dismissing Sparks's Motion on the basis 
that writs of habeas corpus have been abolished in favor of HRPP 
Rule 40 petitions, the circuit court should have treated Sparks's 
Motion as an HRPP Rule 40 nonconforming petition. Turner v. 
Hawai'i Paroling Authority, 93 Hawai' i 298, 306-07, 311, 1 P.3d 
768, 776-77, 781 (App. 2000); HRPP Rule 40(c)(2). 
HRPP Rule 40(c)(2) sets out the criteria for the court
 
to consider a nonconforming petition:
 
(2)
Nonconforming Petition . Where a post-conviction
petition deviates from the form annexed to these rules, it
shall nevertheless be accepted for filing and shall be
treated as a petition under this rule provided that the
petition (i) claims illegality of a judgment or illegality
of "custody" or "restraint" arising out of a judgment, (ii)
is accompanied by the necessary filing fee or by a
well-founded request to proceed without paying filing fees,
and (iii) meets minimum standards of legibility and
regularity.
 
Sparks's Motion meets the criteria for a nonconforming 
petition under HRPP Rule 40(c)(2). The Motion: (i) claims that 
Sparks is being held illegally by the State of Hawai' i pursuant 
to judgments in three criminal cases; (ii) Sparks submitted a Request To Proceed Without Paying Filing Fees, which was

2
belatedly approved by the circuit court;  and (iii) the Motion
met minimum standards of legibility and regularity. 
The rule further provides the procedure for the court
 
to follow in handling a nonconforming petition under HRPP Rule
 
40:
 
When treating a nonconforming petition as a petition
under this rule, the court shall promptly clarify by written
order that the requirements of this rule apply and, if the
information in the petition is incomplete, may require the
petitioner to file a supplemental petition in the form
annexed to these rules before requiring the state to
respond.
 
HRPP Rule 40(c)(2). Thus, the circuit court may address any
 
missing information in the nonconforming petition by entering an
 
order instructing Sparks to supplement his petition as necessary
 
under the rule.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order of Dismissal filed
 
on November 17, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 vacated and this case is remanded for the circuit court to
 
address Sparks's Motion as a nonconforming HRPP Rule 40 petition.

 Sparks's Request to Proceed Without Paying Filing Fees was approved
by the circuit court on November 27, 2009, ten days after the court had
 
dismissed the case on November 17, 2009. On remand, the circuit court should
re-address Sparks's request to waive the filing fees to avoid any question as
to the circuit court's jurisdiction when it approved the waiver on
November 27, 2009.
