IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
ANTHONY K. KEKONA, JR., Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 5247(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Anthony Kekona (Kekona) submitted
 
to the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court)1 a
 
document entitled "HRS 660-6 and HRS 660-7 Order to Show Cause,"
 
referencing habeas corpus provisions and seeking the person by
 
whom he was imprisoned or restrained to appear and show cause. 
On November 16, 2009, the Circuit Court denied Kekona's request
 
by filing the request with "denied" stamps affixed thereto.

 The Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Kekona asserts his right to bring a writ of
 
habeas corpus, alleging among other things that he is illegally
 
confined because he is a Hawaiian National Citizen.
 
The State's position in this appeal is that the Circuit
 
Court erred by summarily denying Kekona's writ of habeas corpus
 
and the State therefore requests that this court remand the case
 
for further proceedings.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Kekona's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Kekona's request to the Circuit Court sought post-
conviction relief based on his belief that he was "unjustly 
imprisoned and restrained of his liberty." Habeas corpus 
proceedings are encompassed within Rule 40 of the Hawai' i Rules 
of Penal Procedure (HRPP). HRPP Rule 40(a). We review a denial 
of a HRPP Rule 40 petition de novo. State v. De Guair, 108 
Hawai'i 179, 187, 118 P.3d 662, 670 (2005). 
Similar to this court's decision in State v.
 
Villanueva, No. 30137, 2010 WL 2513330 (App. June 23, 2010)
 
(SDO), and consistent with the State's position, we conclude that
 
Kekona's request to the Circuit Court should have been addressed
 
as a nonconforming petition under HRPP Rule 40(c)(2). His
 
submission to the Circuit Court was legible and indicated he was
 
challenging the legality of his imprisonment or restraint. HRPP
 
Rule 40(c)(2)(i) and (iii). Further, the record reflects that on
 
January 14, 2010, the Circuit Court approved Kekona's request to
 
proceed without paying filing fees. HRPP Rule 40(c)(2)(ii).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(c)(2):
 
When treating a nonconforming petition as a petition
under this rule, the court shall promptly clarify by written
order that the requirements of this rule apply and, if the
information in the petition is incomplete, may require the
petitioner to file a supplemental petition in the form
annexed to these rules before requiring the state to
respond.
 
After following this procedure, disposition of Kekona's request
 
for relief should have been as provided by HRPP Rule 40(g). 
Further proceedings are therefore required as set forth above.
 
(2) Although not raised below or on appeal by either 
party, it appears from the record that Kekona was represented in 
the underlying criminal matter, CR. No. 5247, by Joel E. August, 
who at the time appears to have been a member of the law firm of 
Mukai, Ichiki, Raffetto & MacMillan. We note that these 
circumstances may not have been evident because the underlying 
criminal conviction was entered in 1979. Moreover, Kekona's 
post-conviction request to the Circuit Court at issue in this 
appeal did not provide the circumstances of the underlying 
conviction and appears to have been addressed by the Circuit 
Court on procedural grounds. On remand, Judge Raffetto shall 
first determine whether he should recuse himself from hearing 
this matter, pursuant to Rule 2.11(a)(6)(A) and (c) of the 
Hawai'i Revised Code of Judicial Conduct. See State v. Gomes, 93 
Hawai'i 13, 17-18, 995 P.2d 314, 318-19 (2000). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the order denying Kekona's
 
"HRS 660-6 and HRS 660-7 Order to Show Cause," filed on
 November 16, 2009 is vacated and this case is remanded for
 
further proceedings. As an initial matter, Judge Raffetto shall
 
determine whether he should recuse himself from hearing this
 
matter. Thereafter, the Circuit Court shall treat Kekona's

"HRS 660-6 and HRS 660-7 Order to Show Cause," as a petition
 
under HRPP Rule 40, consistent with this Summary Disposition
