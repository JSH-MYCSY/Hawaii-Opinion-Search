SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Justice, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Edmund M. Abordo (Abordo) appeals
 
from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying
 
Petition for Post-Conviction Relief (Order Denying Relief), filed
 
on November 30, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
1
(Circuit Court).  As discussed below, it appears that the court
 
lacks appellate jurisdiction and, therefore, the appeal is
 
dismissed.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 23, 2009, Abordo filed a Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief (
Petition), pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40. The case was docketed as SPP 09-1­
0026. The Petition stated the following grounds for relief: 
A. Ground one: Illegal punishment on a
blanket unconstitutional restriction against helping
inmates with habeas corpus cases. i.e. illegal sentence
& conviction

 The Honorable Randal K.O. Lee presided.

Supporting FACTS (tell your story briefly without
citing cases or laws): Petitioner was unlawfully
punished for helping other inmates with their illegal
sentence and conviction. That DPS knew about Abordo's
 illegal detention but did nothing, condoning CCA's
Actions.
 
B. Ground two: Retaliatory conduct by DPS
for filing TRO in federal court in regards to Abordo's
property that resulted in the distruction [sic] &
confiscation of his property.
 
Supporting FACTS (tell your story briefly without
citing cases or laws): DPS knew that Abordo was doing
legal work for inmates as Abordo was the law clerk for
15 years. DPS retaliated against Abordo by having his
key-board destroyed, and his video games and boom box
confiscated.
 
C. Ground three: Violation of due process of
Wolff v. MacDonnell, 418 US 539 (1974) to review
documents that was omitted, that constituted procedure
which was not followed.
 
Supporting FACTS (tell your story briefly without
citing cases or laws): Assistent [sic] Warden Ben
Griego illegally punished Abordo without due process
violating his own rules and procedures regarding the
gathering of evidence. A/W Griego did not submit any
evidence that items he used against Abordo came from
Abordo's cell. i.e. property seizure form.
 
D. Ground four: Unlawful detention of being
held in seg. for over 120 days whereas DPS was aware
of CCA illegal action and condoned it, using CCA staff
as Strongarm.
 
Supporting FACTS (tell your story briefly without
citing cases or laws): CCA's policy #15-2.5.
Supervisor investigation requires an investigation
within 24hrs. Abordo was held 33 days before a
disciplinary report was filed. Once it was filed the
 time served was not counted as time served, the time
started on Oct 16, 08, Abordo was released from seg on
Jan 9, 2009. Abordo illegal punishment was supposed
to end Dec. 15, 08 but was released Jan. 9, 09.
Abordo was put into seg on Sept 13, 08 and held in seg
till Jan 9, 09. 
On August 24, 2009, the State filed an Answer to the
 
Petition, denying that Abordo was entitled to relief on any of
 
the four stated grounds because they did not concern illegality
 
of a judgment or custody. The State requested that the Petition
 
2  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
be dismissed without prejudice or transferred to the civil court,
 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(c)(3).
 
In a letter dated December 16, 2009 from Judge Randal
 
Lee to the Legal Documents Section of the First Circuit, Judge
 
Lee stated:
 
Pursuant to the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure, Rule
40(c)(3), Petitioner's motions: 1) Emergency Motion To
Order The Defendant's (DPS) To Order Its Service
Provider (CCA) To Cease And Desist The Enforcement Of
Torture For Depriving Petitioner Of His Sleep By
Constant Illumination Of His Cell, filed on October 9,
2009; ad 2) Petitioner's Motion For Preliminary
Injunction, filed October 15, 2009, is hereby
transferred to the Office Of the Clerk, First Circuit
Court, State of Hawaii.
 
Attached is an order stating that Petitioner's motions
for post-conviction relief should be filed as a civil
proceeding. Please assign new special proceeding
numbers(s) to the motions and the court's order
together with a summons are to be transmitted to the
Department of the Attorney General for the State of
Hawaii. Additionally, transmit copies of such
documents to the Petitioner.
 
S.P. NO. 09-1-0426
 
The docket to SPP 09-1-0026 states that on October 9,
 
2009, an Emergency Motion to Order the Defendant (DPS) to order
 
its Service Provider (CCA) to Cease and Desist the Enforcement of
 
Torture for Depriving Petitioner of his Sleep by Constant
 
Illumination of His Cell (Emergency Motion re Sleep) was filed,
 
but a copy of the document is not in the record for SPP 09-1­
0026. The Emergency Motion re Sleep is, however, filed as the
 
first document appearing in the record of SP 09-1-0426.
 
On October 15, 2009, Abordo filed a Petitioner's Motion
 
for Preliminary Injunction (Motion for Preliminary Injunction)
 
which referenced SPP 09-1-0029 but the document was filed in SP
 
09-1-0426 and not in SPP 09-1-0026.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On November 30, 2009, in SP 09-1-0426, Abordo filed a
 
2
Motion to Conduct a Hearing Pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(3)(f)  and
Petitioner's Memorandum of Law in Support of His HRPP Rule 40
 
Petition. The memorandum in support stated Abordo's factual and
 
legal arguments regarding the four grounds for relief stated in
 
his Petition in SPP 09-1-0026.
 
Also on November 30, 2009, in SP 09-1-0426, Judge Lee
 
issued the Order Denying Relief, which denied the claims stated
 
by Abordo in SPP 09-1-0026.
 The Order Denying Relief referenced
 
SPP 09-1-0026, but was filed in SP 09-1-0426 rather than in SPP
 
09-1-0026. 
Another file-stamped copy of the letter dated December
 
16, 2009 by Judge Lee that was filed in SPP 09-1-0026 was also
 
filed in SP 09-1-0426 on December 16, 2009.
 
On December 16, 2009, Judge Lee issued an order
 
directing that the Emergency Motion re Sleep and Motion for
 
Preliminary Injunction be Forwarded to the Clerk of the First
 
Circuit Court to be Processed as a Civil Proceeding.
 
On December 21, 2009, in SPP 09-1-0026, Abordo filed a
 
Notice of Appeal from the Order Denying Relief.
 
On January 25, 2010, in SPP 09-1-0026, Abordo filed a
 
Motion to Enforce HRCP Rule 65(b) which requested that the court
 
enforce a Preliminary Injunction in accordance with HRCP Rule
 
65(b).
 
On January 19, 2010, in SP 09-1-0426, the State filed a
 
memorandum in opposition to the Emergency Motion re Sleep and the
 Petitioner's Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
 
On January 25, 2010, SP 09-1-0426 was reassigned to
 
Judge Rhonda Nishimura. 
2
 The Motion to Conduct a Hearing Pursuant HRPP Rule 40(3)(f)
referenced SPP 09-1-0029 but the number was changed to SPP 09-1-0026 and
initialed with the letters "JH" next to it. The document was filed in SP 09­1-0426 but not in SPP 09-1-0026.
 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On February 9, 2010, in SP 09-1-0426, Abordo filed an
 
Ex Parte Motion to Correct the Special Proceedings Number on a
 
Motion that was Filed on January 25, 2010 Entitled Motion to
 
Enforce HRCP Rule 65(b) and Affidavit in Support. Abordo
 
requested that his Motion to Enforce HRCP Rule 65(b) be placed in
 
SP 09-1-0426. 
On February 12, 2010, in SP 09-1-0426, Abordo filed a
 
Motion for Requesting a Master Pursuant to HRCP Rule 53 et seq. 
On March 23, 2010, Judge Nishimura granted Abordo's ex
 
parte motion to remove and refile.
 
On March 25, 2010, in SP 09-1-0426, Judge Nishimura
 
entered an Order Denying (1) the Emergency Motion re Sleep, and
 
(2) the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.
 
Also on March 25, 2010, Judge Nishimura entered an
 
Order Denying Petitioner's Motion for Requesting a Master
 
Pursuant to HRCP Rule 53 et seq.
 
II. DISCUSSION
 
The Order Denying Relief was not filed in SPP 09-1­
0026, but rather in SP 09-1-0426. There is no final appealable
 
order in SPP 09-1-0026, therefore this court lacks appellate
 
jurisdiction to hear any appeal stemming from that special
 
proceeding. HRS § 641-1(a).
 
It appears that the grounds for relief stated in the
 
Petition are civil in nature. "If a post-conviction petition
 
alleges neither illegality of judgment nor illegality of post-
conviction "custody" or "restraint" but instead alleges a cause
 
of action based on a civil rights statute or other separate cause
 
of action, the court shall treat the pleading as a civil
 
complaint not governed by this rule." HRPP Rule 40(c)(3). It
 
further appears that SPP 09-1-0026 was incorporated into SP 09-1­
0426 and transferred to the civil calendar pursuant to HRPP Rule
 
40(c)(3). Notwithstanding the entry of the Order on November 30,
 
2009, it appears that the proceedings in SP 09-1-0426 are ongoing
 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to determine Abordo's claims and no final judgment has been 
entered in SP 09-1-0426. Therefore, this court lacks appellate 
jurisdiction. HRS § 641-1(a); Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & 
Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
III. CONCLUSION
 
This appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
