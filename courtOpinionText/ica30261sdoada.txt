OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
RICHARD DALE DENNIS, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
FELICIA DAWN DENNIS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 06-1-3980)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Felicia Dawn Dennis ("Mother")
 
appeals from the December 3, 2009 Order Re Plaintiff's Motion for
 
Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs and Other Expenses, Etc. Filed
 September 25, 2009 and Defendant's Motion for Attorney's Fees
 Filed October 15, 2009 ("Order"), filed in the Family Court of
 the First Circuit ("Family Court").

The Order awarded Plaintiff-Appellee Richard Dale
 
Dennis ("Father") $4,628.56 in attorneys' fees and costs, and
 $4,735.82 in additional costs, incurred by Father in securing the
 return of the parties' minor children from New Mexico in November
 2008 (the "November 2008 return incident"). The Order denied
 certain other expenses sought by Father. The Order further
 denied Mother's request for an award of attorneys' fees,
 concluding that Father's request was not frivolous because
 Father's expenses were "the result of [Mother's] violation of the
 Court's [R]estraining Order not to remove the minor children from
 the State [o]f Hawaii; and were reasonable and necessary to
 retrieve the children and return them to Hawaii."

On appeal, Mother contends that the Family Court erred 
because: (1) res judicata precludes Father from claiming 
attorneys' fees; (2) Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 580-47(f) requires a claim for attorneys' fees to be raised at the hearing on the issues alleged; (3) it did not consider principles of equity when it awarded attorneys' fees and costs to Father; (4) it awarded excessive fees and costs to Father without considering the respective merits, abilities, and conditions of the parties; and (5) it failed to award attorneys' fees and costs to her under Hawai'i Family Court Rules ("HFCR") Rule 11. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Mother's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Res judicata does not bar Father, in his motion 
dated September 25, 2009, from raising the issue of attorneys' fees and costs related to his efforts to secure his children's return from New Mexico in November 2008. Even if res judicata could apply in this case, the November 2008 return incident was not among the issues raised in the August 7, 2008 motion, the August 25, 2008 motion, or the October 17, 2008 motion, which were the basis for the January 12, 2009 trial. Father's November 2008 return incident-related fees and costs, therefore, were neither actually litigated in the January 12, 2009 trial, nor would they have been properly litigated there.
2 See Bremer v. 
Weeks, 104 Hawai' i 43, 53–54, 85 P.3d 150, 160–61 (2004). 
(2) Mother identifies no deadline in the law by which
 
Father had to bring his motion for attorneys' fees and costs
 related to the November 2008 return incident. Therefore, HRS
 § 580-47(f) does not bar Father's September 25, 2009 request for

 Father correctly observes that res judicata is more commonly
applied to a prior action, not an earlier hearing in the same lawsuit. Thus,
Mother's claim is more akin to "law of the case" which refers to "the usual practice of courts to refuse to disturb all prior rulings in a particular
case, including rulings made by the judge himself." Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of 
Emps.' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai' i, 92 Hawai' i 432, 441, 992 P.2d 127, 136
(2000) (quoting Wong v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 396, 665 P.2d
157, 162 (1983)). For the same reasons as discussed above, the law-of-the­case doctrine does not bar litigation of the attorneys' fees issue as part ofFather's September 25, 2009 motion.

(3) Mother contends that it was inequitable to award
 
attorneys' fees to Father when she earns significantly less
 
income than does Father, she is not able to afford a place to
 live on her own and therefore lives with her parents, and because
 she will be incurring transportation expenses in her drives from
 Alabama to Texas in order to exercise her visitation rights with
 her children. The Family Court found that Father's fees and
 expenses were reasonable and necessary in order to secure the
 return of his children from New Mexico which, the court noted,
 "were the result of [Mother's] violation of the Court's
 [R]estraining Order not to remove the minor children from the
 State [o]f Hawaii." In the face of the record evidence related
 to the November 2008 return incident, Mother has not demonstrated
 
4
that any further findings were necessary  or that the Family
Court abused its discretion or disregarded equity in awarding Father his attorneys' fees. See Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Emps.' 
Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai' i, 106 Hawai' i 416, 431, 106 P.3d 339, 
354 (2005); H
AW. REV. STAT. § 580-47(f). 
(4)
 Mother's fourth point of error extends her third
 
point of error, arguing additionally that the Family Court's
 award of attorneys' fees was excessive. For the reasons
 expressed above, the court did not err.
 
(5) In light of the fact that the Family Court did not
 
err in awarding Father his attorneys' fees and costs, we observe
 no basis upon which the court might have erred in failing to
 award attorneys' fees to Mother under HFCR Rule 11 for the cost
 of defending against Father's motion. 
3
 As part of her argument on this second point of error, Mother
appears to challenge six of the conclusions of law adopted by the Family Court
in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, filed February 18, 2010.
Mother does not explain how those conclusions relate to the underlying
contention that Father's request for fees was not timely made and, for that
reason, we deem those challenges to have been waived. Haw. R. App. P.
28(b)(7) (points not argued may be deemed waived).

 Mother argues that Owens v. Owens, 104 Hawai' i 292, 88 P.3d 664
(App. 2004), requires that, before awarding attorneys' fees, the Family Courtmust first consider whether such an award would be inequitable under HRS
§ 580-47 and make a finding accordingly. Owens, however, concerned HFCR Rule
68, see id., which specifically requires such a finding. See Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 
68. HFCR Rule 68 is not operative here; therefore, Owens does not apply.
