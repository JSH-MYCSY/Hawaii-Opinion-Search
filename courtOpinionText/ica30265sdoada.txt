NO. 30265
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, DEPARTMENT OF HAWAIIAN HOME LANDS, Plaintiff-
Appellee, v. PAUL K.P. KAGAWA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
NORTH AND SOUTH HILO DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO 3RC09-1-754)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Paul K.P. Kagawa (Kagawa) appeals
 
pro se from the Judgment for Possession that was entered on
 
December 16, 2009, in the District Court of the Third Circuit,
 
North and South Hilo Division (District Court)1
 in favor of
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i Department of Hawaiian Home 
Lands (DHHL) as to its complaint for ejectment against Kagawa 
after he allegedly wrongfully occupied real estate owned by DHHL. 
Although it is difficult to discern with certainty, on
 
appeal, Kagawa appears to argue that the District Court erred
 
because it (1) implicitly found that DHHL demonstrated clean
 
title to the property; (2) did not find that Kagawa was entitled
 
to utilize the land pursuant to his traditional rights; and
 
(3)
 did not find that Kagawa was entitled to utilize the land
 
pursuant to certain provisions of the Hawaiian Homes Commission
 Act of 1920.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Kagawa's appeal is
 
without merit.
 
Therefore, the Judgment of Possession that was entered
 
on December 16, 2009, in the District Court of the Third Circuit,
 
North and South Hilo Division is affirmed.
