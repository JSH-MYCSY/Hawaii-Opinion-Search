IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
GARIKK PEREIRA, Applicant-Appellee/Cross-Appellent, v.
AIG HAWAII INSURANCE COMPANY, INC., now known as FARMERS
INSURANCE HAWAII, INC., Respondent-Appellant/Cross-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P. NO. 08-1-0392)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant/Cross-Appellee AIG Hawaii
 
Insurance, Inc., now known as Farmers Insurance Hawaii, Inc.
 
(AIG), appeals from the order entered on December 11, 2009 in the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court),1
 which
granted Applicant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant Garikk Pereira's
 (Pereira) motion to confirm an arbitration award stemming from an
 
insurance dispute. In its essence, AIG's argument is that the
 
arbitrator lacked authority to modify his award after issuing his
 
initial decision on June 17, 2009. Pereira cross-appeals from
 
the same order, which denied his application for attorneys' fees.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve the parties' points
 
of error as follows:

(1) An arbitrator can only issue a final award upon 
the subject matter submitted to the arbitrator's powers. See 
Arbitration of Bd. of Dir. of Ass'n of Apartment Owners of 
Tropicana Manor, 73 Haw. 201, 210-11, 830 P.2d 503, 509 (1992); 
see also Brennan v. Stewarts' Pharmacies, Ltd., 59 Haw. 207, 222, 
579 P.2d 673, 682 (1978) (holding that arbitrators exceeded their 
authority by construing the meaning of a lease when the only 
question submitted to their jurisdiction was the fair monthly 
rental). Prior to issuing a final award, the doctrine of functus 
officio does not strip an arbitrator of authority to change the 
award. See Wayland Lum Constr., Inc. v. Kaneshige, 90 Hawaif i 
417, 423, 978 P.2d 855, 861 (1999). 
In this case, the arbitrator, Dale Lee (Lee), was
 
charged to determine the extent to which Pereira was entitled to
 benefits under his underinsured motorist coverage. While AIG
 
asserts that the covered loss deductible issue was submitted to
 
Lee, it does not cite to any record evidence that demonstrates
 
that Lee was charged to only answer that specific question. 
Additionally, AIG fails to directly address Lee's fundamental
 
failure in his initial award to address the top-line issue
 
submitted to his authority: that is, the extent to which Pereira
 
was entitled to benefits under his underinsured motorist
 
coverage. AIG cites no authorities for the proposition that an
 
arbitrator's award can be a valid exercise of the arbitrator's
 
power when the award simply fails to address the top-line issue
 
submitted to the arbitrator.
 
AIG correctly points out that Lee's reasoning in the
 
supplemental award does not actually provide a logical
 
explanation for why he changed his mind regarding the
 
applicability of the covered loss deductible provision when
 
answering the extent to which Pereira was entitled to benefits
 
under his underinsured motorist coverage. When parties
 
voluntarily agree to arbitrate, they assume the hazards of the
 
process, including the risk that the arbitrator might make

mistakes in the application of law and in the findings of fact. 
See Mars Constructors, Inc. v. Tropical Enters., Ltd., 51 Haw. 
332, 335-36, 460 P.2d 317, 319 (1969). Ultimately, in the 
instant case, the question is not whether Lee decided wisely in 
either his initial or supplemental award but only whether he had 
the authority to issue either. Lee's initial decision was not a 
valid exercise of his powers because it addressed the extent to 
which Pereira was entitled to uninsured motorist benefits, an 
issue that was not submitted to his jurisdiction. See Tropicana 
Manor, 73 Haw. at 211, 830 P.2d at 509; see Brennan, 59 Haw. at 
222, 579 P.2d at 682. Accordingly, the initial decision was not, 
in substance, a final decision that divested him of jurisdiction 
to issue the supplemental award, which did address the issue 
submitted to his jurisdiction—that is, the extent to which 
Pereira was entitled to underinsured motorist benefits. Cf. 
Wayland Lum Constr., 90 Hawaif i at 423, 978 P.2d at 861. Given 
these factors, Lee's supplemental award was permitted under 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-20 (Supp. 2012) because Lee 
had not previously made a final and definite award upon a claim 
submitted by the parties to the arbitration proceeding. 
(2) The structure of Pereira's argument suggests that
 
he believes he is entitled to fees and costs if he can show that
 
he was the prevailing party in a contested judicial proceeding
 
covered by HRS § 658A-25 (Supp. 2012). Pereira provides no case
 
authority holding that the fee-shifting and cost-shifting
 
provisions are meant to be mandatory. Alternatively, Pereira's
 
brief can be read as arguing that AIG's arguments were, as a
 
matter of law, so frivolous so as to make a denial of fees an
 
abuse of discretion. Again, Pereira provides no legal
 
authorities or reasoning for this proposition. Although the
 
court denies AIG's appeal for the reasons discussed above, AIG's
 
position was not so patently frivolous – and, therefore, in
 
contravention of the animating spirit of the statute authorizing
 
the award of attorneys' fees – that it would have been
 
unreasonable for the Circuit Court to deny fees.

Finally, Pereira also argues that there is an 
insufficient record that requires remand. We have remanded a 
case in which the lower court implicitly denied a request for 
attorneys' fees but did not place its reasons for the denial in 
the record. Kemper & Watts, 121 Hawaif i 473, 220 P.3d 1054, No. 
28221 2009 WL 5116751, at *2 (App. Dec. 29, 2009) (SDO); see also City & County of Honolulu v. Hsiung, 109 Hawaif i 159, 179, 124 
P.3d 434, 454 (2005) ("Generally, judges must 'specify the grounds for awards of attorneys' fees and the amounts awarded 
with respect to each ground. Without such an explanation, we 
must vacate and remand awards for redetermination and/or 
clarification.'") (quoting Price v. AIG Hawaif i Ins. Co., Inc., 
107 Hawaif i 106, 113, 111 P.3d 1, 8 (2005)). Here, however, the 
hearing transcript provides a view as to the reason for the 
denial--that is, the closeness of the legal question at issue in 
the contested judicial proceeding. Additionally, to the extent 
that the Circuit Court's order reflects the draft order submitted 
by Pereira, it would not be fair to allow him to benefit from his 
imprecise draftsmanship. See, e.g., A.V. by Versace, Inc. v. 
Gianni Versace S.p.A., 87 F.Supp.2d 281, 291-92 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit's order entered on December 11, 2009 is affirmed.
