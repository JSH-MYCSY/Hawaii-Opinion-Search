NO. 30271
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
RYAN EUGENE WEST, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2667)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Ryan Eugene West (West) appeals
 
from the order denying Motion for Acceptance of Filing of the
 
Petition or Order with Explanation Denying the Petition, entered
 
on December 4, 2009, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(circuit court).1
 
West's Motion for Acceptance of Filing of the Petition
 
or Order with Explanation Denying the Petition (Motion) related
 
to his convictions in Cr. No. 98-0482, Cr. No. 03-1-0479, Cr. No.
 
03-1-0616, and Cr. No. 06-1-0381. The Motion was denied by the
 
circuit court for lack of jurisdiction because the underlying
 
convictions West challenged were before the Circuit Court of the
 
Second Circuit. West had previously tried to file a petition in
 
the circuit court which had been returned to him for filing in
 
the correct circuit.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, West contends that the circuit court erred 
by denying his petition because habeas corpus petitions should be 
brought in the circuit court with jurisdiction over his custody; 
the State "illegally and unconstitutionally imposed the 
respective HRS Penal Code Statutes upon appellant[,] a citizen 
and heir of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and therein not subject to 
Respondent's jurisdiction, such actions rendering the Judgments 
of Conviction and Sentence Illegal[;]" the court erred in 
converting the petition to an Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 40 petition which unconstitutionally transferred the burden imposed by habeas corpus upon respondents to justify the 
restraint of West's liberty, to West to prove that the judgment 
is illegal; and he is entitled to relief because he suffered 
actual prejudice. 
The State contends that the circuit court should not
 
have dismissed the Motion, but rather it should have transferred
 
the matter to the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve West's points of error as follows:
 West stated that the Motion was brought pursuant to
 
HRPP Rules 12 and 40, and Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
Chapter 660. HRPP Rule 40(a) states "[t]he post-conviction
 
proceeding established by this rule shall encompass all common
 
law and statutory procedures for the same purpose, including
 
habeas corpus and coram nobis[.]" West stated that the Motion,
 
asking the circuit court to accept his attached petition for a
 
writ of habeas corpus for filing and decision, was made pursuant
 
to HRPP Rule 40, therefore, the circuit court did not err by
 
treating the petition as a petition under HRPP Rule 40.
 
"A proceeding for post-conviction relief shall be
 
instituted by filing a petition with the clerk of the court in
 
which the conviction took place." HRPP Rule 40(b). HRS § 603­
37.5 (1993) states (emphasis added):

§603-37.5 Cure or waiver of defects. (a) The
 
circuit court of a circuit in which is commenced a
 
civil case laying venue in the wrong circuit shall
transfer the case, upon or without terms and
conditions as the court deems proper, to any circuit
in which it could have been brought, or if it is in
the interest of justice dismiss the case.
 
West attached to the Motion a copy of a letter dated October 8,
 
2009, from the circuit court which states:
 
RE:	 Cr. No. 98-0482, Cr. No. 03-1-0479, Cr. No. 03­
1-0616, Cr. No. 06-1-0381 "Writ of Habeas
Courpus L. 1892 Chapter 57, Section 5 Common Law
of the Hawaiian Islands; L. 1892 Chapter 57
Section 37 (Eighth) to Issue Writ of Habeas
Corpus"; Received September 30, 2009
 
Dear Mr. West:
 
Your above-referenced communication was addressed to
 
and received by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
on September 30, 2009. However, the First Circuit
Court did not preside over your above-referenced
criminal cases and therefore has no jurisdiction over
the matters. Your document is being returned to you
for proper submission to the correct circuit (Circuit
Court of the Second Circuit).
 
No further action will be taken by this Court.
 
West admits that on October 18, 2009, he refiled a
 
petition for habeas corpus with the Circuit Court of the Second
 
Circuit, which was docketed as S.P. No. 09-1-0070(3). However,
 
West filed the Motion with the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
subsequent to the refiling in the Second Circuit and despite
 
being previously informed that documents relating to Cr. No. 98­
0482, Cr. No. 03-1-0479, Cr. No. 03-1-0616, Cr. No. 06-1-0381
 
should not be filed with the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. 
The circuit court was not wrong to dismiss the case, pursuant to
 
HRPP Rule 40 and HRS § 603-37.5. Because the circuit court
 
dismissed the Motion without reaching the merits of the case, we
 
do not address West's other points of error.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the order denying Motion for
 
Acceptance of Filing of the Petition or Order with Explanation
