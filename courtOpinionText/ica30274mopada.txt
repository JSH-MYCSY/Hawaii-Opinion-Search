I. BACKGROUND
 
On September 4, 2008, the Association made a demand for
 
payment on McGrath for an outstanding debt of $2,995.28. On
 
October 17, 2008, the Association filed a Complaint to foreclose
 
against McGrath.
 
On December 1, 2008 Suzanne McGrath-Kitamura (Kitamura)
 
presented a personal check to the Association in the amount of
 
$5,000. The Association refused to accept the check. On January
 
23, 2009, Kitamura presented a cashier's check in the amount of
 
$5,000 to the Association, which the Association again refused to
 
accept. On July 17, 2009, the Association informed McGrath that
 
the outstanding debt owed was $17,216.90
 
On April 1, 2009, the Association requested "Entry of
 
Default as to [McGrath]," which the circuit court entered on the
 
same day. On May 12, 2009, the Association filed its "Motion For
 
Summary Judgment and for Default Judgment" (Motion). The circuit
 
court continued the Association's Motion several times. On
 
October 22, 2009, the circuit court held a hearing on the Motion. 
During the hearing, the circuit court required counsel for
 
McGrath to write a $10,000 check from counsel's client trust
 
account to the Association. The circuit court clarified that it
 
would not be requiring McGrath to pay the full amount claimed to
 
begin mediation, as is generally required under HRS § 514B-146
 
(2006 Repl.). Id. On December 9, 2009, the circuit court
 
entered its written Order, stating in part:
 
3. Plaintiff and Defendant McGrath Properties I, LLC shall
arbitrate their respective claims and/or defenses, pursuant
to [HRS] Section 514B-146; provided that Defendant McGrath
Properties I, LLC shall pay the sum of $10,000.00 to
Plaintiff by no later than October 30, 2009, and provided
further that all deadlines in this case are suspended
pending further order of the Court; and
4. Said arbitration shall commence by December 11, 2009.

 The Association only challenges those portions of the Order related
to arbitration, specifically paragraphs 3 and 4. Paragraphs 1 and 2 state:
1. The hearing on Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and for
Default Judgment filed May 12, 2009 shall be and hereby is
continued until moved on;
2. Defendant McGrath Properties I, LLC's Motion to Set Aside
Entry of Default, filed October 5, 2009, is granted[.]

The Association filed its Notice of Appeal on January 4, 2010. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Abuse of Discretion
 
An abuse of discretion occurs if the trial court has
 
"clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or
 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a
 
party litigant." Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74
 
Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10, 26 (1992).
 
B. Statutory Interpretation
 
Statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo by [the
appellate] court. When construing a statute, our foremost
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention
of the legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from
the language contained in the statute itself. Moreover, it
is a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that, where
the terms of a statute are plain, unambiguous and explicit,
we are not at liberty to look beyond that language for a
different meaning. Instead, our sole duty is to give effect
to the statute's plain and obvious meaning.
 
Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 109 Hawai' i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 
(2005) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets in 
original omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
The Association contends that the circuit court did not 
have the authority to order the parties to arbitration. "Even 
though arbitration has a favored place, there still must be an 
underlying agreement between the parties to arbitrate. Without 
an agreement to arbitrate, a court may not force parties to 
engage in arbitration." Douglass v. Pflueger Hawaii, Inc., 110 
Hawai'i 520, 531, 135 P.3d 129, 140 (2006) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). “A party cannot be required to submit 
to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit. 
To warrant compelling arbitration, there must be an underlying 
agreement between the parties[.]" In re United Public Workers, 
AFSCME, Local 646, AFL-CIO, 124 Hawai' i 372, 379, 244 P.3d 609, 
616 (App. 2010) (internal quotation marks, citations, brackets, 
and emphasis omitted).

3  In its answering brief, McGrath challenges the constitutionality of
HRS § 514B-146(d).  However, McGrath did not file a cross appeal on this
issue.  Regardless, because there was no arbitration agreement, the
constitutionality of HRS §  514B-146(d) is not at issue .
4In the instant case, there simply was no arbitration
agreement.  McGrath does not dispute the lack of an arbitration
agreement.  Nothing in the record or in the briefs suggests that
an arbitration agreement existed. 
Hawai#i law requires an arbitration agreement in order
for a court to compel arbitration.  HRS § 658A-7(c)(Supp. 2010). 
The circuit court ordered the parties to "arbitrate their
respective claims and/or defenses, pursuant to [HRS] § 514B-
146[.]"  HRS § 514B-146(d) provides in pertinent part:
A unit owner who pays an association the full amount claimed
by the association may file in small claims court or require
the association to mediate to resolve any disputes
concerning the amount or validity of the association's
claim. If the unit owner and the association are unable to
resolve the dispute through mediation, either party may file
for arbitration under section 514B-162[.].  3
HRS § 514B-162 (2006 Repl.) states in relevant part:
(a) At the request of any party, any dispute
concerning or involving one or more unit owners and an
association, its board, managing agent, or one or more other
unit owners relating to the interpretation, application, or
enforcement of this chapter or the association's
declaration, bylaws, or house rules adopted in accordance
with its bylaws shall be submitted to arbitration.  The
arbitration shall be conducted, unless otherwise agreed by
the parties, in accordance with the rules adopted by the
commission and of chapter 658A[.]
(Emphasis added.)  Chapter 658A (Supp. 2010), which governs
arbitration, requires an arbitration agreement before a court ma
order arbitration.  "If the court finds that there is no
enforceable agreement, it shall not . . . order the parties to
arbitrate."  HRS § 658A-7(c).  Because there was no arbitration
agreement, the circuit court lacked the authority to order
arbitration pursuant to HRS § 514B-146.y
