STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
TEIKIN MIECHO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(Honolulu Division)
(Case No. 1DTC-06-049025)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Teikin Miecho (Miecho) was
 
convicted of driving without a license, in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes ยง 286-102(a) (2007). 
Miecho appeals from the
 
"Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment"
 (Judgment) filed on December 3, 2009, in the District Court of
 the First Circuit (District Court).

On appeal, Miecho contends that: (1) the District Court 
erred in denying his motion to dismiss for violation of Hawai' i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 9(c)(3)(i) (2007), which requires that warrants "shall be executed without unnecessary delay . . . ."; and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction. 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) concedes 
that the District Court erred in denying Miecho's motion to

dismiss. We accept the State's concession of error as it is 
supported by existing precedent in this jurisdiction. E.g., 
State v. Owens, 116 Hawai' i 172, 172 P.3d 484 (2007); State v. 
Lei, 95 Hawai' i 278, 21 P.3d 880 (2001). 
We decline the State's request to remand the case for 
determination of whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice. Instead, we follow the remedy imposed by the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court in Lei, 95 Hawai' i at 287, 21 P.3d at 889, and 
reverse the District Court's Judgment. In light of our decision, we need not address Miecho's claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. 
We reverse the District Court's Judgment. DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, February 21, 2013.
