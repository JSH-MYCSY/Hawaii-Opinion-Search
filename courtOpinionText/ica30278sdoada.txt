 Bailey was charged with Sexual Assault in the First Degree for
knowingly engaging in digital penetration (Count I), penile penetration (Count
II), cunnilingus (Count III), and fellatio (Count IV) with a person who was
less than fourteen years old.

 (1) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if
the person:
 
(a)	 Intentionally engages in conduct which would
constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances
 
were as the person believes them to be; or
 
(b)	 Intentionally engages in conduct which, under the
circumstances as the person believes them to be,
constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct
intended to culminate in the person's commission of
the crime.

sentence of 20 years for his conviction on each count, to run
 
concurrently with each other, and consecutively with the sentence
 imposed by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit in Criminal
 Case Number 52830. 
On appeal, Bailey raises five points of alleged error. 
Bailey contends that the Circuit Court erred: (1) because there
 was insufficient evidence to support his conviction; (2) in
 denying his motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct that
 purportedly tainted the jury; (3) in seating an alternate juror
 after jury deliberations had already started; (4) because there
 was no rational basis for the court to instruct the jury on the
 included offenses of attempted sexual assault in the first
 degree; and (5) in denying his constitutional right to a public
 trial. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Bailey's
 appeal as follows:
 
(1) There was sufficient evidence to support Bailey's
 
conviction. The minor victim ("Victim"), who was twelve years
 old at the time of trial, testified that on July 22, 2007, Bailey
 had sexually assaulted her in the four ways alleged in Counts I­IV. Victim's brother ("Brother") testified to seeing Victim and
 
Bailey in the Church copy room in a state of undress, while
 Victim's uncle ("Uncle") testified to seeing Bailey performing
 oral sex on Victim in the copy room that evening. 
Bailey admitted to being at the Church on the night of
 
the alleged sexual assaults with an undressed Victim, to being
 confronted by Uncle, and to telling Uncle that he was sorry. 
Bailey said that he could not remember what happened at the
 Church until the moment when he was confronted by Uncle. Bailey
 told Detective Artienda that he knew that he had hurt Victim, her

with another person who is less than fourteen years
old[.]

family, and her friends, and that if he had the opportunity to do
 
so he would tell Victim that he was sorry and that he wished it
 had never happened.
 The fact that the jurors did not believe everything
 
that the witnesses testified to does not prevent them from
 finding Bailey guilty of a lesser included offense. See State v.
 
Laurie, 56 Haw. 664, 666-73, 548 P.2d 271, 274-78 (1976); State
 v. Gager, 45 Haw. 478, 480-85, 370 P.2d 739, 741-44 (1962).
 
(2) The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion by 
denying Bailey's motion for a new trial because of juror misconduct. "As a general matter, the granting or denial of a motion for new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion. The same principle is applied in the context of a motion for new trial premised on juror misconduct." State v. 
Yamada, 108 Hawai
'i 474, 478, 122 P.3d 254, 258 (2005) (quoting 
State v. Kim, 103 Hawai 'i 285, 290, 81 P.3d 1200, 1205 (2003)). 
"[N]ot all juror misconduct necessarily dictates the 
granting of a new trial. A new trial will not be granted if it can be shown that the jury could not have been influenced by the alleged misconduct. [Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure] Rule 
5
52(a)  directs that any error will be harmless and disregarded if
it does not affect the substantial rights of the complaining party." State v. Furutani, 76 Hawai
'i 172, 180, 873 P.2d 51, 59 
(1994) (quoting State v. Amorin, 58 Haw. 623, 630, 574 P.2d 895, 900 (1978)) (ellipses omitted). In Furutani, the supreme court affirmed the circuit court's decision to grant a new trial because the defendant was deprived of a fair trial when jurors, who had given no indication on voir dire that they could not follow the court's instruction not to hold the defendant's failure to testify or otherwise present evidence against him, discussed his failure to testify and used it as a circumstance against him during deliberations.

 (a) Harmless error. Any error, defect, irregularity or
variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be
disregarded.
 
Haw R. Pen. P. 52(a) (2006).

  The Circuit Court followed the procedures required
 
under Furutani, and ruled that the juror misconduct was harmless
 
beyond a reasonable doubt. After hearing Juror 9's improper
 comment about Bailey's prior criminal conduct, the jurors
 themselves recognized that the discussion was inappropriate,
 stopped deliberating, and notified the judge. The jurors offered
 varying accounts of their recollection of what Juror 9 had said. 
The accounts ranged from a juror testifying that Juror 9 stated
 she thought Bailey had been convicted of murder and was on parole
 to another juror testifying that Juror 9 stated she had knowledge
 of a pending or past charge regarding Bailey.
6 Juror 9 herself
 
testified that she told the other jurors that "'[Bailey's] been
 in trouble before . . . . From what I know, it was on a murder
 charge.'" After learning that Juror 9 had told other jurors
 about Bailey's prior criminal charges, the Circuit Court
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
When a defendant in a criminal case claims that he has 
been deprived of the right to a fair trial by an impartial jury, "the initial step for the trial court to take . . . is to determine whether the nature of the [alleged deprivation] rises to the level of being substantially prejudicial." Furutani, 76 
Hawai
'i at 180, 873 P.2d at 59 (quoting State v. Keliiholokai, 58 
Haw. 356, 359, 569 P.2d 891, 895 (1977)). If the trial court determines that the alleged deprivation could substantially prejudice the defendant's right to a fair trial, a rebuttable presumption of prejudice is raised, and "[t]he trial judge is then duty bound to further investigate the totality of circumstances surrounding the [alleged deprivation] to determine its impact on jury impartiality." Furutani, 76 Hawai
'i at 181, 
873 P.2d at 60 (quoting State v. Williamson, 72 Haw. 97, 102, 807 P.2d 593, 596 (1991)). 
6
 Juror 8, for instance, testified that Juror 9 said that "she was
affected by knowledge of a charge against the Defendant for attempted murder
or something of that nature. She didn't elaborate into [sic] that." Juror 1,
who was sitting next to Juror 9, said Juror 9 "was kind of mumbling. . . . And
she's like well, you know, he's been in trouble before . . . . I heard he
might be on parole, she's not sure. And something about murder came up. But
 
she kind of mumbled that so I'm not exactly sure." Juror 2, on the other
hand, recalled that he "heard [Juror 9] start to say something like, um, 'I
know some of his background. I know some things that happened before.' And a
 
few of us started to stick out our hands and say, 'No, no, no. No, no.' And
 
she said something like, 'He's had a prior conviction,' or prior trouble."

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
instructed the jurors to stop deliberations, questioned each of
 
the jurors, and allowed the parties to question each of the
 jurors. 
Each of the jurors testified that they could disregard 
what Juror 9 had said about Bailey's prior criminal conduct and
 make their decision based on the trial evidence. Furthermore,
 the Circuit Court replaced Juror 9, and it instructed the jurors
 to disregard Juror 9's statements that Bailey "at another time
 may have been convicted previously for other wrongful acts" and
 to begin deliberations anew. See State v. Samuel, 74 Haw. 141,
 
147-49, 838 P.2d 1374, 1378-79 (1992) (it is within the trial
 court's discretion to determine that introduction of prior
 conviction merits only a curative instruction to the jury).
 
Although Juror 9's comments regarding Bailey's prior
 
criminal conduct and possibly being on parole at the time of the
 alleged sexual assault was prejudicial, there was overwhelming
 evidence implicating Bailey of the attempted sexual assaults in
 the first degree, including: (1) testimony from Victim; (2)
 testimony from two eyewitnesses; and (3) Bailey's own statements
 acknowledging that he was at the Church with a naked Victim, and
 that he had hurt Victim. See Samuel, 74 Haw. at 149, 838 P.2d at
 
1379 (prejudicial effect of improper reference to defendant's
 prior criminal history outweighed by prompt action of the trial
 judge and overwhelming evidence in support of the verdict). 
The Circuit Court's conclusion that Bailey was not 
deprived of a fair trial by twelve impartial jurors presents a mixed question of fact and law because it is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of this particular case, and is therefore reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. Furutani, 76 
Hawai
'i at 180, 873 P.2d at 59. Since the Circuit Court's 
conclusion was not clearly erroneous, we conclude the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bailey's motion for a new trial.
7 
7
 Although Bailey's point of error challenges the denial of his
motion for a new trial, his argument refers to the Circuit Court's denial of
his motion for mistrial. For the same reasons that we affirm the Circuit
 
Court's denial of Bailey's motion for a new trial, we conclude that the
Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for mistrial.

(3) The Circuit Court erred in seating the alternate
 
juror after the jury had retired to consider its verdict. Haw.
 
R. Pen. P. 24(c);8 State v. Wideman, 69 Haw. 268, 269, 739 P.2d
 
931, 932 (1987) (an alternate juror, replacing an original jury
 member after deliberations have begun "is subject to potential
 undue pressure from the original jury members"). The error,
 however, was harmless.
 
In Wideman, the supreme court concluded that the juror
 
substitution in that case was not harmless, noting "the
 conflicting testimony between Wideman and the victim, the jury
 being deadlocked during much of its deliberations, and the lack
 of an instruction to the new jury to begin its deliberations
 anew[.]" Id. at 270, 739 P.2d at 932. 
The instant case is markedly different. Addressing the
 
Wideman criteria: (1) Bailey's comments did not conflict with
 those of the victim or the witnesses;(2) the jury gave no
 indication of being deadlocked; and (3) the Circuit Court
 instructed the jury to disregard prior deliberations and to begin
 its deliberations anew. In addition: (4) when the alternate
 jurors were dismissed, they were warned that they might be called
 back and that they should not discuss the case with anyone, read
 related media accounts, or further investigate the case; (5) the
 jury had deliberated for less than five hours before contacting
 the Circuit Court and halting its deliberations; (6) before
 seating the alternate juror, the Circuit Court had questioned the
 alternate jurors about whether they had been exposed to any
 information about the case, and they indicated that they had not;
 and (7) after the alternate juror was seated, the jury
 deliberated for approximately three days before returning a
 verdict.

 Alternate jurors.  The court may direct that not more than 4
jurors in addition to the regular jury be called and impaneled to
sit as alternate jurors who shall, in the order in which they are
called, replace jurors who, prior to the time the jury retires to
consider its verdict, become or are found to be unable or
disqualified to perform their duties. An alternate juror who does
 
not replace a regular juror shall be discharged when the jury
 retires to consider its verdict. . . . 
Haw. R. Pen. P. 24(c) (2006) (emphasis added).

     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Circuit Court's decision to seat an alternate juror
 
after jury deliberations had begun, under the circumstances, was
 
erroneous, but harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 
(4) The Circuit Court properly instructed the jury on
 
the lesser included offense of attempted sexual assault in the
 first degree. 
The Hawai
'i supreme court has held that "trial courts 
must instruct juries as to any included offenses when 'there is a rational basis in the evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting the defendant of the included offense,'" and subsequently concluded that a better rule is that "trial courts must instruct juries on all lesser included offenses as specified by HRS § 701-109(5)[.]"
9 State v. 
Haanio, 94 Hawai 'i 405, 413-14, 16 P.3d 246, 254-55 (2001) 
(quoting HRS § 701-109(5) (1993)). 
In State v. Behrendt, the supreme court held that the 
State's evidence that multiple acts of sexual penetration had occurred between the defendant and the victim supported a jury instruction on the lesser included offense of third degree sexual assault. 124 Hawai
'i 90, 108-10, 237 P.3d 1156, 1174-76 (2010). 
In Behrendt, the victim testified that she had been sexually penetrated by the defendant on more than one occasion. The jury was instructed on the crime of first degree sexual assault and the lesser included offense of third degree sexual assault. In holding that the latter instruction was appropriate, the court reasoned that rational jurors could have inferred from the victim's testimony that sexual contact had occurred beforehand. Id. at 108-10, 237 P.3d at 1174-76. 
Similarly, in this case, the jury could have reasonably
 
inferred, based on the testimony from Victim and Uncle, that
 attempts to commit first degree sexual assault in Counts I-IV had
 occurred. Additionally, evidence that Victim could only feel

 The court is not obligated to charge the jury with respect
to an included offense unless there is a rational basis in the
 
evidence for a verdict acquitting the defendant of the offense
charged and convicting the defendant of the included offense.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
what was happening because the lights were off, and the conflict
 
between the testimony of Victim and Uncle regarding the
 particular act of sexual assault that was occurring when Uncle
 turned on the light, casts some doubt on which, if any, acts of
 penetration occurred. However, the testimony from Victim, Uncle,
 Brother, and statements from Bailey himself are all consistent
 regarding Bailey's presence at the Church with a naked Victim. 
The witness testimony, therefore, supported a jury instruction of
 attempted sexual assault in the first degree.
 
Finally, to the extent that the Circuit Court erred in 
failing to instruct the jury on attempted sexual assault in the third degree, such error is harmless because Bailey was convicted of attempted sexual assault in the first degree on all four counts. See Haanio, 94 Hawai
'i at 415, 16 P.3d at 256. 
(5) The Circuit Court did not deny Bailey his
 
constitutional right to a public trial. Bailey's argument that
 his conviction must be vacated because the courtroom was closed
 to the public for up to half a day during individual voir dire of
 the prospective jurors does not fairly characterize the evidence. 
Bailey was unable to establish how long the courtroom door was
 locked; only that it was found to be locked at or about 4:30 p.m.
 No one could testify for how long before or after, or if at all,
 the door remained locked.
 
The facts here are comparable to those in State v. 
Swanson, 112 Hawai
'i 343, 145 P.3d 886 (App. 2006), where we 
rejected a similar claim when the jury returned its verdict after normal business hours, when the courthouse was closed to the public: 
We conclude, finally, that Defendant's constitutional
rights to a public trial were not implicated when the jury
returned its verdict after normal business hours, when the
courthouse was closed to the public, because the closure
"was too trivial to implicate the [constitutional]
guarantee[s.]" United States v. Ivester, 316 F.3d 955, 960
(9th Cir. 2003). We are loath to deploy the Waller/Ortiz
 
"automatic reversal" artillery where the profound policies
to be protected did not need protection. We do not believe
 
the right to a public trial is a trivial thing, far from it,
but we cry wolf only when we see one.
 
Swanson, 112 Hawai 'i at 355, 145 P.3d at 898 (footnote omitted). 
"Absent 'some affirmative act by the trial court meant to exclude 
persons from the courtroom[,]' United States v. Al-Smadi, 15 F.3d

Swanson, 112 Hawai 'i at 355 n.7, 145 P.3d at 898 n.7, Bailey's 
claim under the circumstances is insufficient to implicate his constitutional right to a public trial. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
 
December 10, 2009, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit is
 affirmed.
