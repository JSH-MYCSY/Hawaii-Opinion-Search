adverse possession.
 
On appeal, ILWU contends that the trial court erred:
 
(1) when it denied the ILWU's motion for summary judgment
 
because, based on "the undisputed facts, the statutory provisions
 and judicial precedents in existence and in force" between 1954
 and 1964, ILWU possessed a "vested and indefeasible title to the
 [Property] on the expiration of the ten-year statutory limitation
 period"; and (2) "in relying upon and applying an unknown and
 nonexistent future case, viz. City & County of Honolulu v.
 Bennett, 57 Haw. 195, [5]52 P.2d 1380 (1976)," in denying ILWU's
 motions for summary judgment.
2/
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we find no merit in
 ILWU's claims. 
Each of ILWU's arguments relating to its first point of
 
error depend on adverse possession vesting as it would according
 to the law in place in 1964, and rely on Bennett not applying to
 any cotenancy in this case.

2/
 While ILWU appeals from the Judgment entered following a jury-
waived trial as to Count II of the Complaint, its points of error each concern
the Circuit Court's denial of summary judgment. Review of the record indicates that the Circuit Court addressed three ILWU motions for summaryjudgment prior to entry of the Judgment. While "[a]n appeal from a finaljudgment brings up for review all interlocutory orders not appealable directly
as of right which deal with issues in the case," Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107Hawai'i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) (quoting Pioneer Mill Co., v. Ward,
34 Haw, 686, 694 (1938)) (internal quotation marks omitted), ILWU fails to
identify the specific order denying summary judgment that it contends to beerroneous, fails to identify where in the record the alleged error occurred,or where the alleged error was objected to or the manner in which it wasbrought to the attention of the court. Although we might disregard the points
presented on this basis alone, see Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4), we proceed in
recognition of our appellate courts' long-standing commitment to allowing
parties their day in court, to the extent that we can understand their claims.
See Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai' i 490, 496, 280 P.3d 88, 94 (2012). As it 
stands, since we understand ILWU's arguments to boil down to a contest overthe alleged retroactive application of Bennett, we proceed to address that
issue. 
3/
 While ILWU disputes on appeal that it was ever in a cotenancy with
the Bell Defendants, that issue was not put before the Circuit Court for
resolution. Rather, ILWU, in its second motion for summary judgment, argued
that "For purposes of the instant motion it is assumed, arguendo, that
Defendants had inherited an undivided interest . . . in the subject property."
And, in its post-trial findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court

error, ILWU does not rely on any of the exceptions to the rule
 
announced in Bennett,4/ but argues that the holding itself in
 
Bennett could not apply because it was "nonexistent" in 1964. 
In sum, resolution of ILWU's points of error turns on the
 applicability of Bennett.
 
In 1976, the Hawai' i Supreme Court explained that if 
the land in question is held by cotenants, a "tenant in common
 claiming by adverse possession must prove that he acted in good
 faith towards the cotenants during the statutory period." 
Bennett, 57 Haw. at 209, 552 P.2d at 1390. In most cases, this
 requires that the tenant claiming adversely "must actually notify
 his cotenants that he is claiming against them." Id. 
"[J]udicial decisions are assumed to apply
 
retroactively, but not automatically." Kamaka v. Goodsill
 
Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai' i 92, 117, 176 P.3d 91, 116 
(2008) (original brackets omitted) (quoting Catron v. Tokio
 Marine Mgmt., Inc., 90 Hawai' i 407, 411, 978 P.2d 845, 849 
(1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). "[W]here substantial
 prejudice results from the retrospective application of new legal
 
noted that "[t]he issue of [Bell Defendants'] title is not addressed in this
trial at this time. However, for the purpose of this portion of the trial, it
is assumed that [Bell Defendants] are tenants in common with Plaintiff." With
 ILWU having presented the case on summary judgment and again at trial as a
pure legal question regarding Bennett's retroactive application, premised on
the assumption that a cotenancy existed, the Circuit Court did not determine
that a cotenancy existed; rather, it assumed it. Therefore, we do not address
those arguments on appeal, and focus exclusively on the allegedly ex post
facto application of Bennett.
 
4/
 In most circumstances, this requirement of good faith
will in turn mandate that the tenant claiming
adversely must actually notify his cotenants that he
 
is claiming against them. In the following
exceptional circumstances, however, good faith is
satisfied by less than actual notice: where the tenant
in possession has no reason to suspect that a
 
cotenancy exists; or where the tenant in possession
makes a good faith, reasonable effort to notify the
 
cotenants but is unable to locate them; or where the
tenants out of possession already have actual
 knowledge that the tenant in possession is claiming
adversely to their interests. In these limited
 circumstances, the notice requirement will be
satisfied by constructive notice and "open and
notorious possession."
 
Bennett, 57 Haw. at 209-10.

principles to a given set of facts, the inequity may be avoided 
by giving the guiding principles prospective application only." Id. (quoting Catron, 90 Hawai' i at 411, 978 P.2d at 849) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
ILWU contends that the instant case falls within the 
ambit of three Hawai' i adverse possession cases that did not 
require actual notice: Deponte v. Ulupalakua Ranch, Ltd., 48 Haw. 17, 395 P.2d 273 (1964), Gomes v. Upchurch, 50 Haw. 125, 432 P.2d 890 (1967), and Thomas v. State, 55 Haw. 30, 514 P.2d 572 (1973). ILWU argues that adverse possession was found in Deponte, Gomes, and Thomas after a ten-year period of adverse possession between the years 1928 to 1954, and that the only difference between those cases and the instant case is that this one arises after Bennett was decided. 
ILWU's contention is unpersuasive. Deponte, Gomes, and 
Thomas are inapposite, as those cases involved claimants who provided actual notice or tenants who had actual knowledge. Hawai'i courts have repeatedly applied the Bennett principles to 
5/
claims of adverse possession  covering time periods prior to1976, the year Bennett was decided. Bennett, in fact, arose out 
of decisions and principles extant in 1964. In Bennett, the court interpreted two prior cases, Yin v. Midkiff, 52 Haw. 537, 481 P.2d 109 (1971), and Poka v. Holi, 44 Haw. 464, 357 P.2d 100 (1960), concluding that "because of the general fiduciary relationship between cotenants, a tenant in common claiming by adverse possession must prove that he acted in good faith towards the cotenants during the statutory period." Bennett, 57 Haw. at 
209, 552 P.2d at 1390 (emphasis added). In Bennett itself, the parties claiming adverse possession and their predecessors had possession of the parcel since 1880. See id. at 205, 552 P.2d at 
1388; see also Wailuku Agribusiness Co. v. Ah Sam, 114 Hawai' i 
24, 35-36, 155 P.3d 1125, 1136-37 (2007) (holding that a motion for summary judgment in a 2002 quiet title action should not have been granted because the Bennett notice requirement applied to 
5/
 Accordingly, we see no merit to ILWU's contention that Bennett's
 
principles be regarded as mere dicta, simply because a jury, upon remand in
Bennett, ultimately found that no cotenancy existed.

defendant's claim of adverse possession covering a period 
commencing in 1935); Morinoue v. Roy, 86 Hawai' i 76, 79, 947 P.2d 
944, 947 (1997) (applying Bennett to a 1990 claim of adverse possession, where the period in question commenced in 1920). 
"Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, 
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together, with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Blaisdell v. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 119 Hawai' i 275, 282, 196 P.3d 277, 284 (2008) 
(brackets and emphasis omitted) (quoting Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 Hawai' i 239, 254-55, 172 P.3d 983, 998-99 (2007)) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). ILWU admitted that no actual notice had been given to the Bell Defendants of its claim to adverse possession. Therefore, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, ILWU was not entitled to summary judgment because it failed to show that it acted in good faith in providing notice to the Bell Defendants. Thus, the Circuit Court did not err in denying ILWU's motions for summary judgment as to the Bell Defendants. 
Therefore, the December 8, 2009 Judgment Based Upon
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order on Plaintiff's
 Claim of Adverse Possession (Count II of the Complaint to Quiet
 Title) is affirmed.
