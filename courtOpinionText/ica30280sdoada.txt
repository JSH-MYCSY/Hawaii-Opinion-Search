STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee
v.
 
BLANCHE B. DELA CRUZ, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
EWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-09-010048)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Blanche B. Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz)
 
appeals the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment (Judgment), entered on October 26, 2009 in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Ewa Division (District
 
Court).1 Dela Cruz was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in
 
violation of HRS §§ 291C-105(a)(1), (a)(2) and (c)(1) (2007 Repl.
 & Supp. 2009).
 
On appeal, Dela Cruz contends: (1) the State failed to 
adduce the requisite foundation for admissibility of the speed 
check card, as required by State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai
'i 354, 
227 P.3d 520 (2010); (2) admission of the speed check card into 
1 The Honorable Edwin Nacino presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evidence violated her right to confrontation; and (3) there was
 
insufficient evidence to convict her of Excessive Speeding.
 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai 'i (State) contests 
jurisdiction, asserting that Dela Cruz filed an untimely appeal. 
As an initial matter, we conclude that although the notice of 
appeal filed on behalf of Dela Cruz was untimely, we have 
jurisdiction in this matter. In criminal cases, the Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court has allowed untimely appeals in circumstances where "defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively failed to 
pursue a defendant's appeal from a criminal conviction in the 
first instance[.]" State v. Knight, 80 Hawai
'i 318, 323, 909 
P.2d 1133, 1138 (1996). See also State v. Erwin, 57 Haw. 268, 
269, 554 P.2d 236, 238 (1976); State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai 'i 404, 
407, 967 P.2d 236, 239 (1998). We conclude this exception is applicable for this appeal. 
With regard to the merits, the State concedes that
 
there was insufficient foundation to admit the speed check card
 
into evidence under Fitzwater, and therefore, there was
 
insufficient evidence to convict Dela Cruz of Excessive Speeding. 
However, the State argues that the case should be remanded to the
 
District Court for entry of a judgment against Dela Cruz for
 
violating HRS § 291C-102(a)(1) (2007 Repl.), a lesser included
 
traffic infraction of Speeding.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted, and having given due consideration to the arguments 
advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we hold that the 
State failed to establish that the speed check was "performed in 
the manner specified by the manufacturer of the equipment used to 
perform the check, and . . . the identity and qualifications of 
the person performing the check, including whether that person 
had whatever training the manufacturer recommends in order to 
competently perform it." Fitzwater, 122 Hawai
'i at 377, 227 P.3d

at 543. Therefore, there was insufficient foundation to admit
 
the speed check card into evidence. Without admission of the
 
speed check card into evidence, there was insufficient evidence
 
to convict Dela Cruz of Excessive Speeding.
 
Pursuant to Fitzwater, although there may be 
insufficient evidence of Excessive Speeding, we may remand for 
entry of a judgment for Speeding if there is sufficient evidence 
to find that Dela Cruz was in violation of HRS § 291C-102(a)(1). 
Fitzwater, 122 Hawai 'i at 377-78, 227 P.3d at 543-44; see also 
State v. Bullard, No. 30317, slip op. at 10-16 (Hawai 'i App. 
Sept. 27, 2010). In this case, there was sufficient evidence to 
establish that Dela Cruz was speeding in violation of HRS § 291C­
102(a)(1). Officer Ohia testified that the speed limit was 
fifty-five miles per hour in the area where he paced Dela Cruz, 
and that he observed her traveling faster than the flow of 
traffic and passing other vehicles. Brandon Chin (Chin), Dela 
Cruz's boyfriend who was called as a witness by the defense, 
testified that he was a front-seat passenger in her vehicle when 
Dela Cruz was stopped by Officer Ohia. Chin testified that he 
had been looking at Dela Cruz's speedometer, that she had been 
driving between sixty and sixty-five miles per hour, and that he 
told her to slow down. The District Court found Chin's testimony 
credible in that he looked at Dela Cruz's speedometer, "noticed 
that [she was] exceeding the speed limit," and that she "started 
to slow down at 60 to 65." 
We conclude that there was sufficient evidence
 
presented that Dela Cruz committed the traffic infraction of
 
Speeding, in violation of HRS § 291C-102(a)(1). We also conclude
 
that, with regard to the lesser included Speeding infraction, the
 
improper admission of the speed check card was harmless beyond a
 
reasonable doubt. See Bullard.

Therefore, we vacate the Judgment entered by the
 
District Court on October 26, 2009, and we remand the case for
 
entry of a judgment of Speeding, in violation of HRS § 291C­
102(a)(1).
