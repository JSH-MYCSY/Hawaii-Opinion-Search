entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit
 
Court").1
 
On March 31, 2008, in De Costa v. Rodrigues, Civ. No.
 
03-00598 DAE-LEK (the "District Court Case"), the United States
 District Court for the District of Hawaii ("U.S. District Court")
 entered judgment against Rodrigues in the amount of $850,000.00
 for breach of fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement
 Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq.
 In the instant action before the Circuit Court, Rodrigues, the
 former State Director of Defendant-Appellee United Public
 Workers, AFSCME Local 646, AFL-CIO ("UPW"), sought
 indemnification from UPW for the above-mentioned sum plus his
 attorneys' fees and costs incurred in defending the District
 Court Case. The Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor
 of UPW on the grounds that ERISA preempted Rodrigues's
 indemnification claim.
 
On appeal, Rodrigues argues that the Circuit Court
 
erred in holding that his indemnification claim was preempted
 under ERISA. We affirm.
 
I. Background
 
A. Complaint
 On December 9, 2008, Rodrigues filed his Complaint for
 
Indemnity ("Complaint") against UPW in the Circuit Court,
 
alleging as follows:
 
At all times relevant to this case, Rodrigues was the
 
State Director of UPW, a labor organization. In 1984, UPW
 "established a mutual aid trust to provide supplemental
 hospitalization benefits for its members known as the UPW Local
 636 Mutual Aid 501(c)(9) Trust [("Trust")]" and agreed to provide
 administrative services to the Trust ("Agreement"). Under the
 terms of the Agreement, UPW, "through its State Director acting
 on its behalf," agreed to administer the money payable to or by
 the Trust. Rodrigues provided administrative services to the
 Trust from 1984 until late 2002.

 The Honorable Karl K. Sakamoto presided.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In June 1994, the trustees of the Trust ("Trustees")
 
authorized the investment of Trust funds to be made through the
 
Hewitt Company ("Hewitt Co."). As State Director, Rodrigues
 "processed all investments of [the] Trust funds through Hewitt
 [Co.] on behalf of the . . . Trust." Between late 1998 and late
 1999, Hewitt Co. made a series of investments in Best Rescue
 Systems, Inc. ("Best Rescue") totaling $1.1 million.
 
On December 10, 1999, UPW's parent union, AFSCME,
 
"recommended that the [Trust] demand repayment of all of its
 investments in Best Rescue"; accordingly, Rodrigues, on behalf of
 the Trust, demanded repayment. Best Rescue did not immediately
 comply. In January 2000, UPW, through AFSCME, "filed lawsuits
 against Best Rescue and Hewitt [Co.] on behalf of the . . . Trust
 and its members to collect the funds invested in Best Rescue."
 Hewitt Co.'s principal, Albert Hewitt ("Hewitt"), was later
 "convicted of criminal violations for his role in [the] Trust's
 investments in Best Rescue[.]" Best Rescue filed for bankruptcy. 
In November 2002, AFSCME suspended Rodrigues from his
 
position as State Director and placed UPW under its
 administration.
 
On October 31, 2003, UPW filed a complaint in the
 
District Court Case, seeking recovery from Rodrigues of all of
 the Trust's losses resulting from its investments in Best Rescue.
 Following a bench trial in March 2008, the U.S. District Court
 determined that Rodrigues was liable to the Trust in the amount
 of $850,000.00 plus costs and fees for negligent breach of
 fiduciary duties. 
Rodrigues alleged in the instant case that his
 
liability to the Trust, as well as his attorneys' fees and costs
 in defending the District Court Case, "arose solely from acts
 and/or omissions [that he committed] in his capacity as agent of
 . . . UPW and/or were authorized and/or ratified by the trustees
 of the . . . Trust and/or . . . UPW." On that basis, Rodrigues
 claimed that he was entitled to indemnity from UPW for
 $850,000.00 plus his attorneys' fees and costs incurred while
 defending the District Court Case.

B. Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
 
On June 19, 2009, Rodrigues filed a motion for partial
 
summary judgment as to the liability of UPW ("Motion for Partial
 
Summary Judgment"). Rodrigues attached several documents from
 the District Court Case, including the U.S. District Court's
 March 20, 2008 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
 ("FOF/COL"). 
In the FOF/COL, the U.S. District Court explained that
 
UPW's federal complaint had alleged Rodrigues's liability for
 breach of fiduciary duty in violation of 29 U.S.C.
 § 1104(a)(1)(A)

 ("Count 1"), breach of fiduciary duty by a co­
fiduciary pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 11053

(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and
1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge duties with
respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants
and beneficiaries and­
(A) for the exclusive purpose of:
 
(i) providing benefits to participants and
their beneficiaries; and
 
(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of
administering the plan;

diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that
a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar
with such matters would use in the conduct of an
 enterprise of a like character and with like aims;
 
(C) by diversifying the investments of the plan
so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless
under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to
do so; and
 
(D) in accordance with the documents and
instruments governing the plan insofar as such
documents and instruments are consistent with the
 provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III of
this chapter.

in prohibited transactions in violation of 29 U.S.C.
 
§ 1106(a)(1)(D)4
 ("Count 3").  The U.S. District Court found and
 
concluded that the Trust was "an employee welfare plan governed
 by ERISA." It also found that Rodrigues was the Plan
 Administrator and, while not a Trustee, "was empowered by the
 [Trust] Board to act on their behalf with regard to investment of
 [Trust] funds," and that "[the Board] relied upon his judgment."
 Having concluded that Rodrigues "exercised substantial
 discretionary authority and control of the management of [Trust]
 investments, assets and loan decisions[,]" the U.S. District
 Court further concluded that Rodrigues was a fiduciary of the
 Trust pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A).

fiduciary with respect to the same plan in the following
circumstances:
 
(1) if he participates knowingly in, or knowingly
undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of such other
fiduciary, knowing such act or omission is a breach; 
(2) if, by his failure to comply with section
1104(a)(1) of this title in the administration of his
specific responsibilities which give rise to his status as a
fiduciary, he has enabled such other fiduciary to commit a
breach; or
 
(3) if he has knowledge of a breach by such other
fiduciary, unless he makes reasonable efforts under the
circumstances to remedy the breach.
 
29 U.S.C. § 1105(a) (2012).

Considering Count 1, the U.S. District Court concluded,
 
in part, that Rodrigues:
 
clearly breached his fiduciary duties with respect to all
other loans made to Best Rescue by failing to question
Hewitt about the absence of long-term financing and
repayment of half of the principal of the first loan, and
instead continuing to blindly rely on Hewitt. Indeed, all
subsequent Promissory Notes accepted by [Rodrigues] after
the initial loan did not refer to long-term financing.
[Rodrigues] continued to make further investment into Best
Rescue without questioning the absence of the expected long­term financing or the failure of Best Rescue to repay half
of the initial loan, as promised in the initial Promissory
Note and Security Agreement. Such blind reliance on Hewitt
 in the face of clear red flags was not reasonably
justified. . . . [Rodrigues] should have made an honest,
objective effort to read the subsequent Promissory Notes,
understand them, and question the areas that did not make
sense. If after a careful review of the subsequent
Promissory Notes and discussion with Hewitt, there were
still uncertainties, [Rodrigues] should have had another
expert or attorney review the investment to determine if
further investment was warranted.
 
Thus, the U.S. District Court concluded that Rodrigues breached
 
his fiduciary duties with respect to all loans to Best Rescue
 other than the initial loan and, therefore, was liable under 29
 U.S.C. § 1104 for making an imprudent investment.
 
Considering Count 2, the U.S. District Court concluded,
 
in part, that Rodrigues: 
failed to conduct due diligence on Best Rescue at any time.
[Rodrigues] also failed to make himself aware of Hewitt's
loan origination fee. [Rodrigues] failed to have an
attorney review the Security Agreement and Promissory Notes
on [the Trust's] behalf. [Rodrigues] breached his fiduciary
duties by relying whole-heartedly on Hewitt, failing to take
the actions listed above, and failing to question the
absence of long-term financing for Best Rescue prior to
recommending and authorizing continued investment. All of
 these actions led to the imprudent investment, most of which
could have been avoided, had [Rodrigues] fulfilled his
duties. In addition, these actions allowed Hewitt to
continue to earn loan origination fees for loans in breach
of Hewitt's fiduciary duties.
 
Thus, the U.S. District Court concluded that Rodrigues enabled
 
Hewitt to breach his fiduciary duties and, therefore, was liable
 under 29 U.S.C. § 1105. The court also concluded, however, that
 Rodrigues was not liable on Count 3.
 
any authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has
any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility
in the administration of such plan. . . .
 
29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A) (2012).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In determining the scope of Rodrigues's liability, the
 
U.S. District Court recited 29 U.S.C. § 1109(a) (2012) stating,
 
in relevant part:
 
(a) Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who
breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties
imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be
personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to
the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to
such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made
through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary[.]
 
It ultimately entered judgment against Rodrigues in the amount of
 
$850,000.00. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
 Circuit ("Ninth Circuit") affirmed the U.S. District Court's
 decision in De Costa v. Rodrigues, No. 08-16386, 2009 WL 1489637
 (9th Cir. May 28, 2009).
 
In his Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, 
Rodrigues expanded on his indemnity claim. 
Having no written
 
indemnification agreement with UPW, Rodrigues cited to common law
 principles supporting an employer-principal's limited duty to
 indemnify its employee-agent in the context of employment
 agreements. Rodrigues cited similar principles in arguing that
 UPW was vicariously liable to the Trust for the damages arising
 from his actions. Additionally, Rodrigues argued that UPW should
 be found liable to him in negligence for a) assigning him to a
 position for which he was not sufficiently qualified or trained,
 and b) "failing to provide [him] sufficient information,
 directions and/or instructions regarding his obligations and
 liabilities under ERISA."
 
In opposition, UPW argued that Rodrigues had no right
 
of indemnity because "ERISA preempts any alleged state law
 indemnity claim." Specifically, UPW argued that a breaching
 ERISA fiduciary does not have a right to indemnity under ERISA
 and that ERISA preempts Rodrigues's state-law indemnity claim
 because it is "related to" ERISA. UPW also argued that Rodrigues
 had not paid the federal court judgment yet, so his indemnity
 claim was premature, and that Rodrigues was not entitled to
 indemnity because he was an active, not a passive, wrongdoer.

C. Summary Judgment Order
 
A hearing on the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment
 
was held on September 15, 2009, although Rodrigues failed to
 
provide this court with a transcript of the proceedings. On
 October 7, 2009, the Circuit Court entered the Summary Judgment
 Order, reasoning in full:
 
Kim v. Furikawa , 871 F.2d 1427 (9th Cir. 1989) supports that
Rodrigues' indemnity claim in this case is preempted by
ERISA and a breaching ERISA fiduciary, like Rodrigues, does
not have an equitable right of contribution or indemnity.
Indemnity is merely an extreme form of contribution, and
allowing or implying a right of indemnity by a breaching
ERISA fiduciary would not be consistent with ERISA's goal of
deterring breaches of fiduciary duty. 
See also Meoli v.
 
American Med. Services of San Diego
, 35 F. Supp.[ ]2d 761,
764 (S. D. Ca[l]. 1999).
 
Therefore, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of
 
UPW. The court subsequently awarded UPW attorneys' fees in the
 amount of $4,528.79 and costs in the amount of $156.78 and
 entered the Final Judgment in favor of UPW.
 
II. Standards of Review
 
Summary judgment
 
An appellate court "reviews the grant or denial of 
summary judgment de novo, using the same standard applied by the 
circuit court." State ex rel. Anzai v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 
99 Hawai
'i 508, 515, 57 P.3d 433, 440 (2002) (citing Bitney v. 
Honolulu Police Dept., 96 Hawai 'i 243, 250, 30 P.3d 257, 264 
(2001)). "A court may enter judgment for the non-moving party on a motion for summary judgment where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the non-moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Konno v. Cnty. 
of Haw., 85 Hawai
'i 61, 76, 937 P.2d 397, 412 (1997)). 
ERISA preemption
 
Questions of federal preemption under ERISA are 
reviewed by this court de novo. Ditto v. McCurdy, 90 Hawai 'i 
345, 351, 978 P.2d 783, 789 (1999).

III. Discussion
 
On appeal, Rodrigues argues that the Circuit Court
 
erred in holding that ERISA preempted his indemnification claim
 
against UPW.6 In answer, UPW restates the arguments made before
 
the trial court.
 
A. ERISA Policies, Purposes, and Actions 
As to employee benefit plans, Congress declared ERISA's
 
policy to be 
to protect interstate commerce and the interests of
participants in employee benefit plans and their
beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to
participants and beneficiaries of financial and other
information with respect thereto, by establishing standards
of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries
of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate
remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.
 
29 U.S.C. § 1001(b) (2012) (Congressional findings and 
declaration of policy). In other words, "Congress enacted ERISA . . . to protect plan participants and beneficiaries from abuses and mismanagement in the administration of employee pension and benefit plans." Haw. Laborers' Trust Funds v. Maui Prince Hotel 
(HLTF), 81 Hawai
'i 487, 493, 918 P.2d 1143, 1149 (1996). 
An additional "purpose of ERISA is to provide a uniform
 
regulatory regime over employee benefit plans." Golden Gate
 
Rest. Ass'n v. City & Cnty. of S.F., 546 F.3d 639, 647 (9th Cir.
 2008) (quoting Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200, 208
 (2004)). Such uniformity protects plan administrators from the
 "burden that would be imposed by a patchwork scheme of
 regulation," Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U.S. 1, 11-12
 (1987); the relative simplicity also reduces costs for employers,
 Golden Gate, 546 F.3d at 647. 
ERISA-related claims may be brought pursuant to ERISA
 
provisions or as separately authorized, such as by state
 
6
 While Rodrigues asserted various bases for his indemnification
claim below, only his respondeat superior claim was actually such a claim.
The remainder were instead negligence claims asserted against UPW based on
alleged torts distinct from Rodrigues's actions and the harm caused by those
actions. However, as both the parties and the Circuit Court appeared to
regard the different theories as a single indemnification claim, we likewise
regard his claim as precisely that. 
9
   
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
statutory or common law, subject to ERISA's preemption
 
provisions. Generally, those claims properly brought as ERISA
 claims are either expressly authorized therein, see 29 U.S.C.
 § 1132 (2012), or recognized under federal common law specific to
 ERISA. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 110 
(1989) ("[C]ourts are to develop a 'federal common law of rights
 and obligations under ERISA-regulated plans.'" (quoting Pilot
 Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 56 (1987))).
 
B. Federal Preemption of State Laws
 
Regarding preemption generally, "state and local laws
 
enjoy a presumption against preemption when they 'clearly operate
 
in a field that has been traditionally occupied by the States.'" 
Golden Gate, 546 F.3d at 647 (brackets omitted) (quoting De Buono
 v. NYSA-ILA Med. & Clinical Servs. Fund, 520 U.S. 806, 814 (1997)). Indeed, "the historic police powers of the States are not to be superseded by Federal Act unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." HLTF, 81 Hawai
'i at 492, 918 P.2d 
at 1148 (brackets and ellipsis omitted) (quoting Cipollone v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). "The question whether a certain state action is preempted by federal law is one of congressional intent. The purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone." Bd. of Trs. of 
W. Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund v. H.F. Johnson,
 Inc., 830 F.2d 1009, 1016 (9th Cir. 1987) (quoting Pilot Life,
 481 U.S. at 45); accord HLTF, 81 Hawai
'i at 492, 918 P.2d at 
1148. 
As to preemptive intent:
 
Congress may indicate pre-emptive intent through a statute's
express language or through its structure and purpose. If a
 federal law contains an express pre-emption clause, it does
not immediately end the inquiry because the question of the
substance and scope of Congress' displacement of state law
still remains. Pre-emptive intent may also be inferred if
the scope of the statute indicates that Congress intended
federal law to occupy the legislative field, or if there is
an actual conflict between state and federal law. 
Altria Group, Inc. v. Good, 555 U.S. 70, 76-77 (2008) (citations 
omitted); accord AFL Hotel & Rest. Workers Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque (AFLH), 110 Hawai
'i 318, 323, 132 P.3d 1229, 1234 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2006).
 
Federal law may preempt state law either expressly or
 
impliedly. See Altria Grp., 555 U.S. at 76-77 ("Congress may
 
indicate pre-emptive intent through a statute's express language
 
or through its structure and purpose."). Even where "federal law
 contains an express pre-emption clause, it does not immediately
 end the inquiry because the question of the substance and scope
 of Congress' displacement of state law still remains." Id. at
 
76. 
Implied preemption occurs when "the scope of a statute 
indicates that Congress intended federal law to occupy a field exclusively, or when state law is in actual conflict with federal law." Haw. Mgmt. Alliance Ass'n v. Ins. Comm'r (HMAA), 106 
Hawai
'i 21, 30, 100 P.3d 952, 961 (2004) (citation omitted) 
(quoting Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514 U.S. 280, 287 (1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such implied conflict preemption arises "where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress." Id. (citations 
omitted) (quoting Freightliner Corp., 514 U.S. at 287) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
C.	 Kim and Meoli, on which the Circuit Court relied in
granting summary judgment, did not resolve the
preemption issue because they did not address whether
ERISA preempted state indemnity claims.
 
In concluding that Rodrigues's indemnity claim was
 
preempted, the Circuit Court relied on Kim v. Fujikawa, 871 F.2d
 
1427 (9th Cir. 1989), in which the Ninth Circuit held that ERISA
 did not provide a right of contribution to a breaching fiduciary
 against co-fiduciaries. Id. at 1431-33. Because ERISA does not
 
expressly grant a right of contribution, Kim analyzed whether
 such a right could be implied in the statute:
 
[T]he Supreme Court has noted that, in light of "ERISA's
interlocking, interrelated, and interdependent remedial
scheme, which is in turn part of a 'comprehensive and
reticulated statute,'" it seems clear that "Congress did not
 
intend to authorize other remedies [under ERISA] that it
simply forgot to incorporate expressly." [Mass. Mut. Life
 Ins. Co. v. ]Russell, 473 U.S. [134, 146 (1985)] (quoting
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 446 U.S.
359, 361 . . . (1980)). Given this observation, we cannot
agree with Fujikawa's contention that Congress implicitly
intended to allow a cause of action for contribution under
 
ERISA. See Russell, 473 U.S. at 145 . . . ("'The federal
judiciary will not engraft a remedy on a statute, no matter
how salutary, that Congress did not intend to provide.'")
(quoting California v. Sierra Club, 451 U.S. 287, 297 . . .
(1981)). Indeed, implying a right of contribution is
particularly inappropriate where, as in this case, the party
seeking contribution "'is a member of the class [e.g.,
fiduciaries] whose activities Congress intended to regulate
for the protection and benefit of an entirely distinct class
[e.g., ERISA plans],'" and where there is no indication in
the legislative history "that Congress was concerned with
softening the blow on joint wrongdoers." Texas Industries,
 
Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 639 . . .
(1981) . . . .
 
Id. at 1432-33. 
The Circuit Court also cited to Meoli v. Am. Med.
 
Servs. of San Diego, 35 F. Supp. 2d 761 (S.D. Cal. 1999), which,
 
relying in part on Kim, concluded that ERISA does not authorize a
 right of indemnification for a breaching fiduciary against co-
fiduciaries. Id. at 762-65. Meoli also observed that "[a]n
 
analysis of ERISA reveals an intent to protect participants,
 beneficiaries and plans, and remedies are provided to fiduciaries
 only insofar as they advance that purpose." Id. at 764 (quoting
 
NARDA, Inc. v. R.I. Hosp. Trust Nat'l Bank, 744 F. Supp. 685, 696
 (D. Md. 1990)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
While Kim and Meoli each concluded that Congress did 
not intend to grant a right of either contribution or indemnification to breaching fiduciaries under ERISA, neither their reasoning nor the Circuit Court's analysis addressed whether Congress intended to bar such state law claims. Because Rodrigues brought his claim as a state law claim, Kim and Meoli are inapposite as they do not address the question of whether ERISA preempts state indemnity claims. With respect to ERISA's preemption of state claims, we are bound by Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
precedents on this issue. We therefore turn to applying the preemption analysis established by our supreme court. 
D.	 Under the Hawai
'i Supreme Court's tests for ERISA
preemption, Rodrigues's claim for indemnification is
neither expressly nor impliedly preempted. 
1.	 Rodrigues's indemnification claim is not
expressly preempted.

ERISA expressly preempts "any and all State laws
 
insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee
 
benefit plan."7 29 U.S.C. 1144(a) (2012). As this "broadly
 
worded provision is 'clearly expansive'" but necessarily not
 infinite in scope, Egelhoff v. Egelhoff ex rel. Breiner, 532 U.S.
 141, 146 (2001) (quoting N.Y. State Conference of Blue Cross &
 Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co. (Travelers), 514 U.S.
 645, 655 (1995)), courts have at times found application of
 § 1144 to be a bedeviling task. Dishman v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. of
 
Am., 269 F.3d 974, 980 (9th Cir. 2001) ("It is with great
 trepidation that we tread into the field of ERISA
 preemption. . . . '[D]eveloping a rule to identify whether ERISA
 preempts a given state law . . . has bedeviled the Supreme
 Court.'" (footnote omitted) (quoting Rutledge v. Seyfarth, Shaw,
 Fairweather & Geraldson, 201 F.3d 1212, 1216 (9th Cir. 2000), as

 Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N.A., Inc.
 (Dillingham), 519 U.S. 316, 335 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring)
 ("Our earlier [preemption] cases sought to apply faithfully the
 statutory prescription that state laws are pre-empted 'insofar as
 they . . . relate to any employee benefit plan.' . . . But
 applying the 'relate to' provision according to its terms was a
 project doomed to failure, since, as many a curbstone philosopher

The Hawai

. . . requires not just the existence of an ERISA plan, but 
questions involving the plan's administration and the benefits provided." AFLH, 110 Hawai
'i at 327, 132 P.3d at 1238. 
In AFLH, an ERISA plan, through enforcement of a
 
subrogation agreement, sought reimbursement from beneficiaries
 for medical expense benefits it had paid where the beneficiaries
 had also recovered monies from the third-parties liable for
 having caused their expenses. Id. at 320-21, 132 P.3d at 1231­
32. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court addressed the question of whether, 
under these circumstances, ERISA preempted "a [plan's] state law
 breach of contract claim [brought] against a plan beneficiary."
 Id. at 322, 132 P.3d at 1233. In holding that the claims were
 not preempted, the court noted that it had earlier adopted the
 approach of the federal Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals for
 determining express preemption. The Hawai
'i Supreme Court 
stated:
 
Recognizing that "relate to" cannot be infinite in scope,
this court in Garcia [v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 90 Hawai' i 
425, 978 P.2d 863 (1999)] adopted the approach of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, holding thatstate law claims are expressly preempted where they rely on
a person's "status as a beneficiary under the ERISA plan and arise from the administration of benefits under the plan." Garcia, 90 Hawai' i at 433, 978 P.2d at 871 (citing Kuhl v. 
Lincoln National Health Plan of Kansas City, Inc., 999 F.2d
298, 303-04 (8th Cir.1993)). 
Id. at 324, 132 P.3d at 1235 (original brackets omitted).
 
The court noted that with respect to the plan's breach
 
of contract claim, there was no claim regarding improperly
 
withheld benefits, "no need to inquire into the medical services
 provided, and no need to inquire into the administration of the
 plan or its benefit structures." Id. at 325, 132 P.3d at 1236. 
The court held that express ERISA preemption of a state law claim
 required not only the existence of an ERISA plan, but "questions
 involving the plan's administration and the benefits provided."
 Id. at 327, 132 P.3d at 1238. Because the plan's state law claim
 for breach of the subrogation agreement did not implicate the
 plan's administration and the benefits provided, the court
 concluded that there was no express ERISA preemption. Id.
 
Similarly, in this case, Rodrigues's indemnity claim 
against UPW does not implicate the plan's administration or the
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
benefits provided. Rodrigues's liability to the plan for breach
 
of his fiduciary duties has already been established. The
 resolution of Rodrigues's indemnity claim against UPW, which is
 based on theories of respondeat superior and UPW's negligence
 against Rodrigues, do not raise questions involving the plan's
 administration and the benefits provided. Therefore, under AFLH,
 Rodrigues's state indemnity claim is not expressly preempted by
 ERISA.
 
2.	 Rodrigues's indemnity claim is not impliedly
preempted. 
Rodrigues argues that, under AFLH, his indemnity claim
 
is not impliedly preempted by ERISA.
8 We agree.
 
In AFLH, the supreme court stated that "a state law
 
'will be deemed impliedly preempted if it conflicts with
 
§ 1132(a) [ 9
] ("conflict" preemption) or if Congress intended
ERISA to occupy the entire field ("field" preemption).'" Id. at 
323, 132 P.3d at 1234 (brackets and ellipsis omitted) (quoting 
HMAA, 106 Hawai 'i at 30, 100 P.3d at 961)). With respect to 
field preemption, the court noted that it has "previously held that [field preemption] does not apply in the ERISA context because the existence of an express preemption clause in ERISA and the fact that health care is a subject of traditional state regulation demonstrate no clear and manifest intent to supersede state law." Id. at 323, 132 P.3d at 1234 (citing HMAA, 106 
Hawai
'i at 30-31, 100 P.3d at 961-62. As in AFLH, implied field

 UPW's answering brief does not address Rodrigues's arguments against
implied preemption.

 29 U.S.C. § 1132 provides in relevant part:
 
(a) Persons empowered to bring a civil action
 A civil action may be brought-­
. . . . 
(3) by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to
enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision
of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to
obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress
such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of
this subchapter or the terms of the plan[.] 
29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3) (2012).
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
preemption does not apply to Rodrigues's indemnity claim.
 
With respect to implied conflict preemption, the test 
applied by the Hawai 'i Supreme Court is whether the state-law 
cause of action "duplicates, supplements, or supplants the ERISA 
civil enforcement remedy[.]" Id. (quoting HMAA, 106 Hawai 'i at 
31, 100 P.3d at 962). Such a state-law cause of action "conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the ERISA remedy exclusive and is therefore pre-empted." Id. (quoting 
HMAA, 106 Hawai
'i at 31, 100 P.3d at 962). In AFLH, the court 
concluded that since ERISA's civil enforcement remedy provision (29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3)) did not provide a legal remedy for the reimbursement of expenses sought by the plan, the plan's state law claim did not duplicate or supplant ERISA's civil enforcement remedy. Id. Similarly, in this case, ERISA does not provide a 
civil enforcement remedy for a fiduciary's claim for indemnity or contribution. See Kim, 871 F.2d at 1432-33; Meoli, 35 F. Supp. 
2d at 762-65. Therefore, Rodrigues's state indemnity claim does not duplicate or supplant ERISA's civil enforcement remedy. 
Whether Rodrigues's claim supplements ERISA's remedies 
or instead is regarded as an independent cause of action, "turns on whether [indemnification] liability would exist only because of the ERISA plan; that is, whether the [purported indemnitor's] potential liability 'derives entirely from the particular rights and obligations established by the benefit plan.'" AFLH, 110 
Hawai
'i at 323-24, 132 P.3d at 1234-35 (original brackets 
omitted) (quoting Aetna Health, 542 U.S. at 213). Here, though, UPW's alleged obligation to indemnify derives not from the plan's "particular rights and obligations," but rather, from the alleged duties UPW owed to Rodrigues by virtue of UPW designating Rodrigues as its agent to serve as a plan fiduciary. Rodrigues's indemnification claim does not "exist only because of the ERISA plan" and is not a remedy that supplements one already available under ERISA. Therefore, Rodrigues's indemnity claim does not duplicate, supplement, or supplant an existing ERISA remedy, and it is not conflict preempted. 
16
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
E.	 While not preempted, Rodrigues cannot prevail on his
claim because we affirm the lower court on grounds that
Rodrigues's own negligence defeats his indemnification
claim. 
Rodrigues's claim, while surviving preemption,
 
nevertheless fails because, as explained infra, an agent's claim
 
for indemnification against his principal will not lie where that
 claim is premised solely on a theory of the principal's vicarious
 liability for the harmful acts of its agent. We therefore affirm
 the judgment on this alternative ground. 
The Circuit Court found the preemption issue 
dispositive; hence, despite UPW's argument below, the Circuit Court did not address whether Rodrigues's negligence was a bar to his indemnity claim. However, it is well-established that "an appellate court may affirm a judgment of the lower court on any ground in the record that supports affirmance." Canalez v. Bob's 
Appliance Serv. Ctr., Inc., 89 Hawai
'i 292, 301, 972 P.2d 295, 
304 (1999) (quoting Gold v. Harrison, 88 Hawai 'i 94, 103 n.7, 962 
P.2d 353, 362 n.7 (1998)). This principle is perhaps most appropriately applied in the review of summary-judgment proceedings because an appellate court "steps into the shoes of the trial court and applies the same legal standard as the trial court applies." Arquette v. State, 128 Hawai
'i 423, 433 n.14, 
290 P.3d 493, 503 n.14 (2012) (quoting Blaisdell v. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 119 Hawai
'i 275, 284, 196 P.3d 277, 282 (2008)). Thus, 
it is appropriate for us to consider whether Rodrigues's indemnification claim may have merit. 
Rodrigues argued below that, in certain circumstances,
 
a principal has a duty to indemnify its agent, citing sections
 438 and 439 of the Restatement (Second) of Agency.
10 However,
 
10
 In relevant part, these sections provide that:
 
In the absence of terms to the contrary in the agreement of
employment, the principal has a duty to indemnify the agent where
the agent . . . suffers a loss which, because of their relation, it
is fair that the principal should bear."
 
R

conduct to indemnify him for . . . payments of damages to third

the commentary to section 439 clarifies that "[a]n agent who

 the principal, is not entitled to indemnity for losses caused by
 such conduct." § 439 cmt. d; accord R
ESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY
 
§ 8.14 cmt. b (2005) ("A principal's duty to indemnify does not
 extend to losses that result from the agent's own negligence

 initiated against an agent, "[a] principal does not have a duty
 to indemnify an agent against . . . losses caused solely by
 wrongful acts committed by the agent." R
ESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF AGENCY
 
§ 8.14 cmt. d. 
That an agent is not entitled to indemnification for
 
damages arising solely from his or her own misconduct is well-
established in the law. See, e.g., Gaines v. Walker, 986 F.2d
 
1438, 1442 (D.C. Cir. 1993) ("[T]he oft-repeated rule is that a
 principal is ordinarily not obliged to indemnify an agent for the
 agent's own tortious conduct."); Pearson Ford Co., 78 Cal. Rptr.
 at 282 (holding that the invocation of non-contractual implied
 indemnity in California requires that the claimant "[d]id not
 actively nor affirmatively participate in the wrong"); Shair-A-
Plane v. Harrison, 189 N.W.2d 25, 27 (Minn. 1971) ("[W]e know of
 no rule of law whereby, absent an express agreement to the
 contrary, a duty of indemnity is imposed upon a principal for
 losses incurred [d]ue to the agent's fault. Rather, the rule is
 that such a duty does not exist under those circumstances."
 (citing R
ESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY § 440(a) & cmt. a)); Ramos v.
 
Browning Ferris Indus. of S. Jersey, Inc., 510 A.2d 1152, 1158–59

 indemnification for its own acts." (citing Cartel Capital Corp.
 v. Fireco of N.J., 410 A.2d 674, 683 (N.J. 1980))).
 
In the Circuit Court, Rodrigues claimed that UPW had a
 
duty to indemnify him because UPW was "vicariously liable" to the
 Trust for Rodrigues's actions. 
However, it is widely recognized

that a party is personally liable for his own negligence and
 
misconduct even if he or she was acting as an agent. See, e.g.,
 
Finnell v. Pitts, 132 So. 2, 4 (Ala. 1930) ("We believe that the
 rule is universal that an agent is not excused from personal
 liability for a tort which he commits for and in the name of his
 principal, whether the principal is liable to suit or not.");
 Galie v. RAM Assocs. Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 757 P.2d 176, 177 (Colo.

 (citing Strang v. Hollowell, 387 S.E.2d 664, 666 (N.C. Ct. App.
 1990))); Comer v. Risko, 833 N.E.2d 712, 716 (Ohio 2005) ("An
 agent who committed the tort is primarily liable for its actions,

 Co., 227 S.E.2d 189, 193 (S.C. 1976) ("An agent's liability for
 his own tortious acts is unaffected by the fact that he acted in

 S.W.2d 339, 347 (Tex. Civ. App. 1955) ("[A]n agent is always
 primarily liable for his own torts . . . ."). 
To allow a culpable agent to shift the loss to his 
principal, who is merely vicariously liable, would unjustly enrich the culpable agent, and be contrary to the purposes of indemnification. See R
ESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 886B (1979) 
("If two persons are liable in tort to a third person for the same harm and one of them discharges the liability of both, he is entitled to indemnity from the other if the other would be unjustly enriched at his expense by the discharge of the liability."); Brooks v. Dana Nance & Co., 113 Hawai

416–17, 153 P.3d 1091, 1101–02 (2007) (recognizing the Restatement of Torts test, turning on whether the party from whom indemnity is sought would otherwise be unjustly enriched). The 
19
   
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
law of indemnity, in the case of vicarious liability, works in
 
favor of the vicariously liable party, not against it. See
 
Howard Univ. v. Watkins, 857 F. Supp. 2d 67, 72 (D.D.C. 2012)
 ("Indemnity has been granted to prevent unjust enrichment . . .
 where the indemnitee was liable only vicariously for the conduct
 of the indemnitor[.]" (emphasis added) (quoting Wash. D.C. v.

§ 22(a)(2)(i) (2000) (permitting non-contractual indemnity where
 "the indemnitee . . . was not liable except vicariously for the
 tort of the indemnitor[.]" (emphasis added)).
 
The U.S. District Court's FOF/COL clearly establish
 
that Rodrigues was held liable for his own actions (or lack
 thereof). Rodrigues cites to no authority supporting his
 contention that he is somehow relieved of liability, or that he
 is entitled to indemnification from UPW despite his own negligent
 acts, merely because UPW was his employer. Furthermore,
 Rodrigues cites to no authority for the proposition that he is
 entitled to indemnification because he, in his words, "did not
 benefit in any manner" from those acts for which he was
 adjudicated negligent, and we hold that, even if true, such a
 fact would be immaterial. Because Rodrigues is responsible for
 his own conduct, he is not entitled to be indemnified for his
 negligent acts as a matter of law.
 
Therefore, we hold that Rodrigues's indemnification
 
claim is not viable under the law of indemnity.
11
 
11
 Rodrigues also argued that UPW was liable to him for its
negligence in hiring Rodrigues to serve as the Trust's administrator and for
not properly instructing him. Whether UPW is separately liable to Rodrigues
for breaching some duty in negligence, however, is a completely distinct issue
from whether Rodrigues is entitled to the indemnification he sought in his
Complaint.
