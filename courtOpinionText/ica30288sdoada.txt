Following a jury trial finding Kahawai guilty of

ยง 706-662 (Supp. 1989) and as a repeat offender pursuant to HRS
 
ยง 706-606.5 (Supp. 1989). Kahawai's conviction was affirmed on
 
direct appeal.
 
1The Honorable Michael D. Wilson presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On February 16, 2005, Kahawai filed a Petition for 
Post-Conviction Relief, pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of Penal 
Procedure (HRPP), Rule 40. On August 18, 2005, the Circuit Court 
denied the Petition, and Kahawai did not appeal that decision. 
On September 24, 2009, Kahawai filed a second Petition 
for Post-Conviction Relief, pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. Kahawai 
claimed that his extended sentence was illegal because the 
statute that he was sentenced under was declared unconstitutional 
in State v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai 'i 432, 168 P.3d 562 (2007) 
(Maugaotega II) and was therefore void ab initio. In his 
memorandum supporting the Petition, Kahawai expressly stated that 
he was not asserting that Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 
(2000) and its progeny should be applied retroactively to his 
case. On December 30, 2009, the Circuit Court denied this 
Petition without holding a hearing. Kahawai appeals from this 
decision. 
On appeal, Kahawai contends: (a) the Circuit Court
 
erred by denying his Petition without holding a hearing; (b) he
 
had ineffective assistance of trial counsel; (c) he was denied
 
due process of law and the right to a fair trial; (d) there was
 
prosecutorial misconduct; (e) his extended sentence is illegal
 
under, inter alia, Maugaotega II and Apprendi because a jury must
 
make appropriate findings, not the trial judge; (f) the extended
 
sentencing statute was void ab initio; and (g) the Circuit Court
 
erred in not assigning him counsel to assist him in his Rule 40
 
petition.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Kahawai's points of error as follows:
 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) Kahawai failed to raise before the Circuit Court
 
all but one of the issues he now raises in his points of error on
 
appeal. In particular, he did not raise in his Rule 40 Petition
 
below his claims that: he received ineffective assistance of
 
trial counsel; he was denied due process of law and the right to
 
a fair trial; prosecutorial misconduct; his extended sentence is
 
illegal under Maugaotega II and Apprendi because a jury must make
 
2
appropriate findings, not the trial judge;  and the Circuit Court
failed to assign him counsel for his Rule 40 petition. 
"Normally, an issue not preserved at trial is deemed to be 
waived. But where plain errors were committed and substantial 
rights were affected thereby, the errors may be noticed although 
they were not brought to the attention of the trial court." 
State v. Fagaragan
, 115 Hawai 'i 364, 367-68, 167 P.3d 739, 742-43 
(App. 2007) (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets 
omitted). For each of Kahawai's claims raised for the first time 
in this appeal, he has waived those claims, and there is no basis 
in the record to support plain error. 
Additionally, Kahawai did not assert these issues in
 
his first Rule 40 Petition filed in 2005, and he does not claim
 
the existence of extraordinary circumstances for failing to raise
 
the issues in the first Petition. On this additional basis, the
 
issues are waived and relief is not available pursuant to HRPP
 
Rule 40. HRPP Rule 40(a)(3).
 
(2) The only issue that Kahawai raised in his Rule 40
 
Petition before the Circuit Court is his claim that the extended
 
sentencing statute, HRS ยง 706-662, is void ab initio given the
 
2
 As noted above, this claim was expressly waived in Kahawai's
memorandum supporting the Petition before the Circuit Court. Even if this 
issue had not been waived, it has been clearly established that Maugaotega IIand Apprendi do not apply retroactively to cases like this where Kahawai'sconviction and sentence were final before Apprendi was decided. State v. 
Gomes, 107 Hawai' i 308, 312-14, 113 P.3d 184, 188-90 (2005); Loher v. State, 
118 Hawai' i 522, 537-38, 193 P.3d 438, 453-54 (App. 2008).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ruling by the Hawai 'i Supreme Court in Maugaotega II. However, 
case law following Maugaotega II establishes that the extended 
sentencing statute was not void ab initio. See State v. Jess, 
117 Hawai 'i 381, 407-15, 184 P.3d 133, 159-67 (2008); State v. 
Cutsinger, 118 Hawai 'i 68, 79-82, 185 P.3d 816, 827-30 (App. 
2008), overruled in part on other grounds by Jess, 117 Hawai 'i at 
398 n.17, 184 P.3d at 150 n.17. Therefore, the Circuit Court 
properly denied Kahawai's Rule 40 Petition. 
(3) The Circuit Court did not err by denying Kahawai's 
Rule 40 Petition without holding a hearing because Kahawai made 
no colorable claim that entitled him to relief. Dan v. State, 76 
Hawai'i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Circuit Court's Findings
 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief, filed on December 30, 2009, is affirmed.
