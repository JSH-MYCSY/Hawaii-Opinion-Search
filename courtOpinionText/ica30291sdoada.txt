NO. 30291
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
ROPATI J. TAUTUA, Claimant-Appellant,
v.
 
BCI COCA-COLA BOTTLING COMPANY OF LOS ANGELES,
Employer-Appellee, Self-Insured,
and
 
SEDGWICK CMS, Third-Party Administrator-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2005-503 (2-99-06569))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this workers' compensation case, Claimant-Appellant
 
Ropati Tautua (Tautua), 
pro se, appeals from the Decision and
 
Order (Decision) issued by the Labor and Industrial Relations
 
Appeals Board (Board) in Case No. AB 2005-503 (2-99-06569), filed
 
on August 18, 2009. In this Decision, the Board determined that:
 
(1) Tautua is not permanently totally disabled, either on a
 
medical or an odd-lot basis, as a result of the May 11, 1999 work
 
injury; (2) Tautua is entitled to an award of benefits for a 28%
 
permanent partial disability of the whole person for his low back
 
condition; and (3) Tautua is entitled to an award of benefits for
 
a 15% permanent partial disability of the whole person for his
 
psychiatric condition.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Tautua appears to argue that: (1) the Board
 
erred in striking evidence from the record because the evidence
 
was not submitted in a timely manner; and (2) the Board erred in
 
concluding that he is not permanently totally disabled.
 
Before addressing Tautua's points of error, we note 
that his opening brief does not conform with Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b) in a number of ways, including that it does not contain: a statement of the case or 
references to the record, in violation of HRAP Rule 28(b)(3); 
points of error, in violation of HRAP Rule 28(b)(4); or relevant 
parts of the authorities relied upon, in violation of HRAP Rule 
28(b)(8). Moreover, Tautua does not include in the record on 
appeal the transcript of the Board hearing as provided in HRAP 
Rule 10. Therefore, this court is unable to address Tautua's 
arguments to the extent that they require a review of the hearing 
transcripts. See Lepere v. United Pub. Workers, Local 646, AFL­
CIO, 77 Hawai' i 471, 474, 887 P.2d 1029, 1032 (1995). Although 
"such noncompliance offers sufficient grounds for the dismissal 
of the appeal[,]" it is the policy of Hawai' i appellate courts to 
afford "litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible[.]" See, e.g., Hous. Fin. & Dev. 
Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111-12 
(1999) (citation omitted). Accordingly, we will address Tautua's 
points of error to the extent that they can be discerned. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Tautua's
 
appeal as follows:
 
(1) Tautua contends that certain evidence was improperly
 
struck from the record by the Board. Although Tautua does not
 
specify the evidence at issue, it appears from our review of the
 
record that he is referring to attachments 1 and 2 to his Facts
 
Statement that was filed with the Board on January 6, 2009.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The sole issue decided by the Board was the extent of
 
permanent disability resulting from Tautua's May 11, 1999 work
 
injury. The Board initially set the deadline to submit medical
 
reports for November 24, 2006 and then extended it to
 
November 28, 2006. At that time, the trial before the Board was
 
scheduled for January 19, 2007. Subsequently, by way of amended
 
pretrial orders, the trial was twice re-scheduled but the
 
deadline for submitting medical reports was not extended. Trial
 
was held before the Board on December 3, 2008. In a post-trial
 
1
submission,  Tautua attempted to introduce a February 8, 2008
medical certificate from Dr. Steven Kaneshiro (attachment 1) and
 
a November 26, 2008 letter from Dr. Kaneshiro (attachment 2),
 
both of which stated in summary fashion and without explanation
 
that Tautua was permanently disabled. After Employer objected to
 
the submission of attachments 1 and 2, the Board struck these
 
attachments by way of an order dated February 23, 2009.
 
According to Hawai
'i Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12­
47-41: 
§12-47-41 Rules of evidence. The board shall not be 
bound by statutory and common law rules relating to the
admission or rejection of evidence. The board may exerciseits own discretion in these matters, limited only byconsiderations of relevancy, materiality, and repetition, bythe rules of privilege recognized by law, and with a view tosecuring a just, speedy, and inexpensive determination ofthe proceedings. 
The Board possesses wide discretion in managing the evidence and
 
the Board's evidentiary ruling should be upheld absent an abuse
 
of discretion. See Athens v. Int'l Archaeological Research
 
Inst., Inc., No. 29495, 2011 WL 5997078 (Haw. App. Nov. 30, 2011)
 (SDO); Sugano v. State Dep't of Attorney Gen., No. 29246, 2010 WL
 
231100 (Haw. App. Jan. 22, 2010) (SDO).

 It appears from the record that the parties were allowed to file
post-trial submissions, but there is nothing in the record to suggest that
they were allowed to submit evidence or medical reports as part of this
submission.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
According to HAR § 12-47-22(b)(3), the medical reports
 
submission deadline is the date that all medical records or
 
reports should have been filed with the Board. The Board clearly
 
set this date for November 28, 2006 by an order amending the
 
initial pretrial order, which thus controlled the course of the
 
appeal. See HAR § 12-47-22(c).
 
Attachments 1 and 2 from Dr. Kaneshiro were dated in
 
February and November of 2008, long after the deadline for
 
submitting medical reports on November 28, 2006. The record
 
indicates that Tautua was seeing Dr. Kaneshiro for his work
 
injury since 1999. Tautua does not provide any explanation as to
 
why he waited until long after the medical reports deadline
 
elapsed to obtain and to provide these documents from
 
Dr. Kaneshiro, nor does he argue that he was prevented from
 
obtaining such medical documents in a timely manner. We
 
therefore conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in
 
ordering that the attachments be stricken from the record.2
 
(2) Tautua challenges the Board's determination that he is
 
not permanently totally disabled. According to Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 386-1 (1993 Repl.), "[t]otal disability" is
 
"disability of such an extent that the disabled employee has no
 
reasonable prospect of finding regular employment of any kind in
 
the normal labor market." The "permanency and totality of the
 
disability shall be determined on the facts." HRS § 386-31(a)
 
(1993 Repl.).
 
We review the Board's decision pursuant to HRS § 91­
14(g) (1993 Repl.), which provides:
 
(g) Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions
for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the
decision and order if the substantial rights of the
petitioners may have been prejudiced because the

 We further note that, because attachments 1 and 2 from Dr. Kaneshiro
provided no explanation or basis for his assessment as to permanent total
disability, these documents shed minimal light on the issue before the Board.

administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders
are:
 
(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4) Affected by other error of law; or
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative,
and substantial evidence on the whole record; or
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of
discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of
discretion.
 
With regard to the determination of whether a worker's 
compensation claimant is permanently and totally disabled, "it is 
the duty of the Board to make such a finding, and it should not 
be overturned unless such determination was clearly erroneous in 
light of the evidence on the whole record." Atchley v. Bank of 
Hawai'i, 80 Hawai' i 239, 245, 909 P.2d 567, 573 (1996) (citation 
omitted). 
Moreover, in reviewing the Board's decision, we give 
deference to the Board's assessment of the credibility of 
witnesses and the weight the Board gives to the evidence. Moi v. 
State Dep't of Pub. Safety, 118 Hawai' i 239, 242, 188 P.3d 753, 
756 (App. 2008). 
It is well established that courts decline to consider the
 
weight of the evidence to ascertain whether it weighs in
favor of the administrative findings, or to review the
agency's findings of fact by passing upon the credibility of
witnesses or conflicts in testimony, especially the findings
of an expert agency dealing with a specialized field.
 
Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai' i 263, 268, 47 P.3d 730, 735 (2002) 
(quoting Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai' i 402, 409-10, 38 
P.3d 570, 577-78 (2001)). 
In this case, the Board credited the medical reports of
 
Dr. Lorne Direnfeld, Dr. James Langworthy, Dr. Edward Chesne,
 
Dr. Byron Eliashof, Dr. Clifford Lau, Dr. Jack Scaff, and
 
Dr. Dana Zichittella as well as other credible evidence to find
 
that Tautua "does not have physical and/or psychiatric disability
 
of such an extent that he has no reasonable prospect of finding
 
regular work of any kind in the normal labor market" and that
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"issues of motivation and anger hindered his participation in
 
[vocational rehabilitation] and thwarted his return to work."
 
Tautua argues that he should have been deemed totally 
and permanently disabled based on the alleged statements or 
opinions of various health care providers that he sets forth in 
his opening brief. However, Tautua does not provide record 
citations for these alleged statements or opinions, nor does he 
challenge the Board's underlying findings of fact related to 
whether he sustained a permanent total disability. The Board's 
unchallenged findings are binding on this court. See Moi, 118 
Hawai'i at 245, 188 P.3d at 759. 
Based on the Board's findings and the evidence
 
submitted, Tautua is capable of performing at least light duty or
 sedentary work. Dr. Direnfeld, Dr. Lau, and Dr. Langworthy all
 
concluded that Tautua is qualified for work, at least at a
 
sedentary or light duty capacity. Dr. Chesne opined that Tautua
 
did not have any physical cardiac limitations precluding him from
 
returning to work. Likewise, Dr. Scaff opined that from a
 
cardiovascular standpoint, Tautua was not limited from returning
 
to work. Dr. Zichittella opined that Tautua's psychiatric
 
impairment, due 80% to a preexisting personality disorder, would
 
not preclude him from gainful employment if his work injury claim
 
could be settled. Dr. Eliashof opined that Tautua's psychiatric
 
condition did not prevent him from returning to work and that the
 
primary limiting factor was Tautua's hope for secondary gain and
 
his frustration regarding his monetary award. Additionally, as
 
set forth in the Board's Finding of Fact 27 in the Decision:
 
While receiving vocational rehabilitation services,
[Tautua] was virtually incorrigible by canceling multiple
appointments despite counselling or otherwise failing to
make progress toward planning his return to work or
developing a functional plan. Ultimately, this caused the
[Disability Compensation Division] vocational rehabilitation
unit to close his case for want of movement toward job
placement.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Moreover, Tautua does not provide any argument or basis
 
to contend that he should have been deemed permanently and
 
totally disabled on an "odd-lot" basis, and this issue is thus
 
waived. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7).
 
Considering the record as a whole, the Board's
 
determination that Tautua is not permanently and totally disabled
 
as a result of his work injury is supported by reliable,
 
probative, and substantial evidence, and thus, was not clearly
 
erroneous. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Board's 
Decision and Order issued on August 18, 2009 is affirmed.
