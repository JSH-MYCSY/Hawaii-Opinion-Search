Section 641-1(a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
authorizes appeals in civil matters from all final judgments, 
orders, or decrees of the circuit courts. But "an appeal from 
any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does 
not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties 
or contain the finding necessary for certification under [Hawaif i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule] 54(b)." Jenkins v. Cades 
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawaif i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 
1338 (1994). The Hawaif i Supreme Court explained further that

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
if a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and (ii)
dismiss any claims not specifically identified.
 
Id. The Jenkins opinion gave examples that illustrated the
 
exacting level of specificity and clarity required. Id. at 119­
20 n.4, 869 P.2d at 1138-39 n.4.
 
Here, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's
 
(circuit court) Second Amended Final Judgment, it stated that
 
[p]ursuant to the jury's verdict of February 21, 2008, [as
to] the count for misrepresentation and fraud, judgment was
entered in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiff, but
this relief was VACATED by the Order Granting Plaintiff's
Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or Alternatively New
Trial on the Issue of Defendant's July 6, 2006 Counterclaim
for Fraud and Misrepresentation, filed October 15, 2008.
 
Additionally, in a footnote, the circuit court explained that it
 
had erroneously reinstated the jury award of $200,000 for
 
Horowitz's fraud claim but that the claim had been struck in an
 
order dated October 15, 2008.
 
In the October 15, 2008 order, the circuit court
 
granted Hester's motion for judgment as a matter of law, stating
 
"judgment in favor of Plaintiff and Counterclaim Defendant shall
 
be entered on the issue of Defendants' Counterclaim for Fraud and
 
Misrepresentation as Defendants and Counterclaimants' failed to
 
plead fraud or misrepresentation as to the sale of the property
 
with particularity." This statement references an intent to
 
enter judgment in the future. It does not actually purport to
 
enter judgment on the claim. Additionally, the circuit court did
 
not ever separately enter judgment in favor of Hester. Instead,
 
in February 2009, the circuit court referenced its October 15,
 
2008 order but then erroneously entered judgment in favor of
 
Horowitz as to this claim.
 
In sum, the Second Amended Final Judgment does not
 
satisfy the requirements for an appealable judgment under HRS
 
§ 641–1(a), HRCP Rule 54(b), or the holding in Jenkins. Absent

an appealable final judgment, the court lacks appellate
 
jurisdiction and Defendant-Appellant Horowitz's appeal is
 
premature. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
30293 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
