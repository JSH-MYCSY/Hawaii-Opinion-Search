At trial, Honolulu Police Department Officer Russel
 
Maeshiro (Officer Maeshiro) testified that using an "LTI 20/20
 
UltraLyte handheld laser speed detection unit" (laser gun),
 Officer Maeshiro determined that Jenkins was driving Jenkins's
 vehicle 75 miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone. Officer
 Maeshiro testified that he was positioned on the H-1 Freeway on
 the right shoulder just prior to the Middle Street tunnel when he
 aimed the laser gun at Jenkins's vehicle, which was traveling
 eastbound. The District Court found Jenkins guilty as charged of
 excessive speeding.
 
On appeal, Jenkins contends that: (1) the excessive
 
speeding charge was defective for failure to allege a state of
 mind; (2) Officer Maeshiro's testimony about the contents of the
 laser gun manual violated the "best evidence rule," Hawaii Rules
 of Evidence (HRE) Rule 1002 (1993); (3) an insufficient
 foundation was laid for the admission of the laser gun's speed
 reading; and (4) there was insufficient evidence to support his
 conviction. We affirm the District Court's Judgment.
 
I.
 A.
 
Jenkins was orally charged as follows:
 
Mr. Jenkins, on or about April 29, 2009, in the City and
County of Honolulu, [S]tate of Hawaii, you did drive a motor
vehicle at a speed exceeding the applicable State of Hawaii
or County speed limit by 30 miles per hour or more thereby
committing the offense of Excessive Speeding in violation of
Section 291C-105 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
Jenkins argues that the charge was defective because it failed to
 
allege a state of mind, namely, that he committed the offense
 intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. We disagree.

It is well settled that an accusation must
 
sufficiently allege all of the essential elements of the
offense charged, a requirement that obtains whether an
accusation is in the nature of an oral charge, information,
indictment, or complaint. Put differently, the sufficiency
of the charging instrument is measured, inter alia, by
whether it contains the elements of the offense intended to
 be charged, and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what
he or she must be prepared to meet. A charge defective in
this regard amounts to a failure to state an offense, and a
conviction based upon it cannot be sustained, for that would
constitute a denial of due process. 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 391, 219 P.3d 1170, 1178 
(2009) (internal quotation marks, brackets, citations, and 
footnote omitted). 
Jenkins failed to object to the sufficiency of the
 
excessive speeding charge in the District Court. We therefore
 apply the liberal construction rule in evaluating the sufficiency
 of his charge. Under this rule, the charge is presumed valid and
 will not be found to be insufficient "unless the defendant can
 show prejudice or that the [charge] cannot within reason be
 construed to charge a crime." Id. at 399-400, 219 P.3d at
 
1186-87 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
Jenkins does not contend that he was prejudiced by the
 
failure to allege a state of mind in the excessive speeding
 charge. Thus, we focus our examination on whether Jenkins can
 show that the charge cannot within reason be construed to charge
 a crime.
 
B.
 
The essential elements of an offense are "(1) conduct,
 
(2) attendant circumstances, and (3) results of conduct, as . . . specified by the definition of the offense[.]" HRS § 702-205 (1993); State v. Mita, 124 Hawai' i 385, 391, 245 P.3d 458, 464 
(2010). The state of mind is not included as an element of an offense, State v. Klinge, 92 Hawai' i 577, 584 n.3, 994 P.2d 509, 
516 n.3 (2000); State v. Aganon, 97 Hawai' i 299, 303, 36 P.3d 
1269, 1273 (2001), but nonetheless must be proved. See HRS 
§ 701-114 (1993); HRS § 702-204 (1993). 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
HRS § 291C-105, the statute defining the excessive 
speeding offense, does not specify a required state of mind. See 
footnote 2, supra. Where the offense does not specify a state of 
mind, "the default states of mind of 'intentionally,' 'knowingly,' or 'recklessly,' [are] required as to each element of the statute." State v. Bayly, 118 Hawai' i 1, 10, 185 P.3d 
186, 195 (2008); see HRS § 702-204.

C.
 
Generally, a charge is sufficient if it tracks the 
language of the statute proscribing the offense. See State v. 
Silva, 67 Haw. 581, 585, 698 P.2d 293, 296 (1985); State v. Cordeiro, 99 Hawai' i 390, 406, 56 P.3d 692, 708 (2002). Here, 
the oral charge tracked the language of the statute. Moreover, an indictment need not allege that the crime was committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, "except where such characterization is used in the statutory definition of the 
4
offense." HRS § 806-28 (1993);  see State v. Torres, 66 Haw.
281, 285, 660 P.2d 522, 525 (1983).
 
In Torres, the Hawai' i Supreme Court considered whether 
a count of an indictment, drawn in the language of the statute, that charged the defendant with incest was insufficient for failure to allege the mental state necessary to establish the offense. Torres, 66 Haw. at 289, 660 P.2d at 527. The court 
concluded that the incest charge was sufficient, reasoning as follows: 
3/ HRS § 702-212 (1993) provides that the default states of mind do not
apply to "[a] crime defined by statute other than [the Hawaii Penal Code],
insofar as a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for such offenseor with respect to any element thereof plainly appears." HRS § 291C-105 isnot part of the Hawaii Penal Code. However, Plaintiff-Appellee State ofHawai'i does not argue that HRS § 291C-105 is a strict liability offense. 
4/ HRS § 806-28 provides in relevant part:
 
The indictment need not allege that the offense was
committed or the act done "feloniously", "unlawfully", "wilfully",
"knowingly", "maliciously", "with force and arms", or otherwise
except where such characterization is used in the statutory
definition of the offense.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Our conclusion that the crime was unmistakably defined
despite the lack of an explicit averment of the mental state
accompanying the prohibited act rests on the nature of the
offense charged and the earlier conclusion that it is not a
crime that can be accidentally or innocently committed. In
 some situations knowledge or intent "need not be alleged in
terms, and a pleading is good if it fairly imports knowledge
or intent." United States v. Arteaga-Limones, 529 F.2d
1183, 1199 (5th Cir.1976); 1 C. Wright, Federal Practice &
Procedure § 125, at 377-78 (1982). Incest as charged here
is an offense where intent can be inferred because "sexual
 intercourse" under the circumstances alleged could only be a
wilful act.
 
Id.
 
In State v. Kane, 3 Haw. App. 450, 652 P.2d 642 (1982),
 
Kane was charged with carrying on his person a pistol or revolver
 
without a permit or license, in violation of HRS § 134-9 (Supp.
 1980). Id. at 451, 652 P.2d at 644. The statute defining the
 
offense did not specify a mental state, and the indictment
 charging Kane did not allege that he acted with any mens rea in
 committing the crime. Id. at 451-53, 652 P.2d at 644-45. This
 
court held that the indictment was sufficient, concluding that
 "the allegation in the indictment that Kane 'did carry on his
 person a pistol or revolver without a permit or license to carry
 a firearm' was sufficient to imply that Kane did so
 'intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.'" Id. at 457, 652 P.2d
 
at 648.

D.
 
Here the excessive speeding charge against Jenkins
 
tracked the language of the statute proscribing the offense, and
 the statute did not specify a required mental state. In
 addition, the charge against Jenkins alleged that he drove his
 vehicle 30 miles per hour or more over the applicable speed
 limit. As in Torres and Kane, a reckless state of mind can be
 inferred from the conduct alleged in the charge. Accordingly, we
 conclude that the failure to expressly allege that Jenkins acted

Hawai'i Supreme Court adopted this court's analysis in Kane. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
with a reckless state of mind did not render the charge
 
deficient.
 
II.
 
Jenkins contends that the District Court erred in: (1)
 
permitting Officer Maeshiro's testimony about the contents of the
 laser gun manual because such testimony violated the best
 evidence rule; and (2) admitting evidence of the laser gun's
 speed reading because an insufficient foundation had been laid
 for such evidence. We conclude that Jenkins has failed to
 establish that he is entitled to relief on these claims.
 
A.
 
Officer Maeshiro testified that the laser gun he used
 
to determine Jenkins' speed was a "LTI 20/20 UltraLyte"; that he
 was trained in the operation and was qualified to operate the
 laser gun; that this training included classroom and practical
 instruction on an earlier version of the laser gun, the LTI 20/20
 Marksman, and updated training on the LTI 20/20 UltraLyte; that
 his training was based on the manual for the laser gun that had a
 Laser Technologies, Inc. "copyright phrase on it" and was marked
 "LTI or Laser Technologies, Inc.," which he "guess[ed was] the
 company that made the unit"; and that his training was based on
 the manufacturer's specifications as designated in the LTI
 manual. Over hearsay objections, Officer Maeshiro was permitted
 to testify that the manual described how to test the laser gun
 and that he was trained to test the laser gun in accordance with
 the testing methods designated in the manual. According to
 Officer Maeshiro, he performed the tests he was trained to
 perform on the laser gun; the tests were done correctly and in
 accordance with the manufacturer's specifications; and the tests
 showed that the laser gun was operating properly.
 
Officer Maeshiro testified that he noticed Jenkins's
 
vehicle "definitely traveling above the posted speed limit,"
 aimed the laser gun at Jenkins's car, and obtained a speed
 reading of 75 miles per hour from the laser gun. A few questions
 later, Jenkins objected to the testimony about the speed reading
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
for lack of foundation, and the District Court overruled the
 
objection. 
B. 
Jenkins contends that the District Court erred in
 
permitting Officer Maeshiro to testify about the contents of the
 laser gun manual. Jenkins claims that this testimony violated
 
6
the best evidence rule set forth in HRE Rule 1002  because the
State was required to introduce the manual -- the best evidence
 of the manual's contents. Jenkins, however, did not object to
 Officer Maeshiro's testimony regarding the contents of the manual
 on the ground of the best evidence rule in the District Court,
 but rather objected on the ground of hearsay. Jenkins thus
 waived any objection on the ground of the best evidence rule. 
See
 HRE Rule 103 (1993 & Supp. 2010) ("Error may not be
 
predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless
 a substantial right of the party is affected, and . . . [i]n case
 the ruling is one admitting evidence, a timely objection or
 motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground
 of objection . . . "); State v. Matias, 57 Haw. 96, 100-01, 550
 P.2d 900, 903-04 (1976) ("[T]he making of an objection upon a
 specific ground is a waiver of all other objections." (internal
 quotation marks and citation omitted)). 
Jenkins's failure to raise a best-evidence-rule 
objection deprived the District Court of the opportunity to rule on the issue. Jenkins's failure to raise this objection also deprived Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) of the 
opportunity to cure any alleged error by seeking to admit the manual in evidence.
7 
6/ HRE Rule 1002 provides: "To prove the content of a writing,
recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is
required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute."
 
7/ Jenkins states that allowing Officer Maeshiro to testify about the
contents of the manual "also allowed the Court to consider inadmissible
 hearsay." However, aside from this conclusory assertion, Jenkins offers no
argument on why Officer Maeshiro's testimony about the contents of the manual
constitutes hearsay. Jenkins thus waived this argument and we need not

C.
 
Jenkins argues that an insufficient foundation was laid
 
for the admission of the laser gun's speed reading. Aside from
 
his best-evidence-rule claim, Jenkins does not raise any specific
 argument on appeal that Officer Maeshiro's testimony was
 improperly admitted. See footnote 7, supra. Instead, Jenkins
 
argues that Officer Maeshiro's testimony was insufficient to
 establish the requisite foundation. Because we have rejected
 Jenkins's best-evidence-rule claim, we consider all of Officer
 Maeshiro's testimony in deciding whether a sufficient foundation
 was laid for the admission of the laser gun's speed reading. 
In State v. Assaye, 121 Hawai' i 204, 216 P.3d 1227 
(2009), the Hawai' i Supreme Court articulated the test for 
establishing a sufficient foundation for admission of a laser gun's speed reading. The court held that the State is required to show that the officer using the gun tested it according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures and that the officer's training in the operation of the gun meets the requirements indicated by the manufacturer. Id. at 215, 216 P.3d at 1238. 
Officer Maeshiro's testimony showed that the laser gun
 
he used to determine Jenkins's speed was a "LTI 20/20 UltraLyte";
 that he had been trained to operate and was qualified to operate
 the laser gun based on the laser gun's manual that was marked
 "LTI or Laser Technologies, Inc." and also copyrighted by Laser
 Technologies, Inc.; that he tested the laser gun in accordance
 with the manufacturer's specifications set forth in the manual;
 and that the tests showed that laser gun was operating properly. 
We conclude that the foundation laid by Officer Maeshiro's
 testimony was sufficient to support the admission of the laser
 
7/(...continued)
address it. See
 Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7) (2006)
("Points not argued may be deemed waived."). In any event, Officer Maeshiro's
testimony about the contents of the manual was not offered to prove the truthof the matters asserted in the manual, but only to show that he followed thedirections set forth in the manual in testing the laser gun. Officer Maeshiro's testimony for this purpose was not hearsay. 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
gun's speed reading. Accordingly, Jenkins has failed to
 
demonstrate that the District Court's admission of the laser
 gun's speed reading constitutes error.
 
III.
 
Jenkins argues that there was insufficient evidence to
 
support his conviction because the State failed to prove: (1)
 whether the offense occurred on a state or county highway; (2)
 that the speed limit signs were "official" signs posted by the
 Director of Transportation on highways under the Director's
 jurisdiction; (3) the margin of error for the laser gun; and (4) 
that he acted with a reckless state of mind. We reject Jenkins's
 arguments.
 
A.
 
Jenkins did not object to the District Court's taking 
judicial notice of the "speed schedule" proffered by the State.
8 
The "speed schedule" is certified by the State Director of Transportation as a "true and correct document listing of posted speeds on our State highways." Referring to the "speed schedule," Officer Maeshiro identified the "area in question" regarding this case as the "H-1 freeway in the vicinity of the Middle Street overpass specifically by mile marker post 18.48 and 18.72, in that general area, Koko Head bound," which according to the "speed schedule" has a speed limit of 35 mile per hour. Officer Maeshiro also testified, without objection, that Jenkins had to pass three posted speed-limit signs which indicated that the speed limit was 35 miles per hour, before reaching Officer Maeshiro's position; that the signs were clear and unobstructed; and that the signs were "official City and County of Honolulu, [S]tate of Hawai' i, traffic control signs." 
When viewed in the light most favorable to the State,
 
State v. Tamura, 63 Haw. 636, 637, 633 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1981), we
 conclude that the State adduced sufficient evidence to prove that
 
8/ We also take judicial notice of the "speed schedule," a document
entitled "Oahu Speed Limit Inventory State Highways April 2008" and maintained
at the District Court.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Jenkins's offense occurred on a State-controlled highway (the H-1
 
Freeway) and that the maximum applicable speed limit had been
 established by "official" signs placed by the Director of
 Transportation on highways under the Director's jurisdiction. 
See State v. Vallejo, 9 Haw. App. 73, 80-83, 823 P.2d 154, 158-60
 (1992) (concluding that a police officer could give a lay opinion
 that a speed limit sign was "official" and that the presumption
 of HRS § 291C-31(c) could be used to established that the sign
 was placed under lawful authority). 
B.
 
The laser gun's speed reading of 75 miles per hour was
 
40 miles per hour over the applicable speed limit and 10 miles
 per hour over the speed necessary to establish the excessive
 speeding charge against Jenkins. No issue or evidence was
 presented at trial regarding any margin of error regarding the
 laser gun's speed reading, and Jenkins did not argue to the
 District Court that the evidence was insufficient due to the
 failure to prove a margin of error. Jenkins also has not cited
 any authority suggesting that the margin of error for the laser
 gun used in this case approaches anywhere near ten miles per
 hour. 
We conclude that under the circumstances of this case,
 
the State was not required to establish a margin of error for the
 laser gun in order to present sufficient evidence that Jenkins
 exceeded the applicable speed limit by 30 miles per hour or more. 
The evidence of the laser gun's speed reading was sufficient to
 prove this element of the excessive speeding charge.
 
This court's decision in State v. Dibenedetto, 80 
Hawai'i 138, 906 P.2d 624 (Hawai' i App. 1995), which Jenkins's 
relies upon in support of his argument, is distinguishable. In Dibenedetto, evidence was introduced at trial that the margin of error for an intoxilyzer's blood alcohol content (BAC) reading 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was .01%, in a case where the intoxilyzer's BAC reading was .11%9
 
and the threshold for the offense of driving under the influence
 
of an intoxicant was a BAC of .10%. Id. at 140-43, 906 P.2d at
 
627-29. This court held that in order to prove the offense
 beyond a reasonable doubt, the prosecution was required to
 establish that the intoxilyxer's BAC reading when taken together
 with the intoxilyzer's margin of error equaled or exceeded the
 statutory threshold. Id. at 146, 906 P.2d at 632. 
We do not read Dibenedetto as imposing a blanket rule
 
requiring the prosecution to introduce evidence of a measuring
 device's margin of error in every case where such a device is
 used to establish a statutory threshold. Rather, Dibenedetto
 provides that where evidence is presented at trial that a
 measuring device used to establish a statutory threshold has a
 specified margin of error, the prosecution is required to prove
 that the reading produced by the measuring device minus the
 margin of error equals or exceeds the statutory threshold.
 
C.
 
There was sufficient evidence to show that Jenkins
 
acted with a reckless state of mind in committing the excessive
 speeding offense. The evidence showed that Jenkins was driving
 his vehicle 40 miles per hour over the posted speed limit and 10
 miles per hour more than the speed necessary to establish the
 excessive speeding offense. Contrary to Jenkins's claim, there
 was evidence that the signs he passed, which warned him of the
 35-miles-per-hour speed limit, were clear and unobstructed. We
 also disagree with Jenkins's contention that he did not have
 sufficient time from when he passed the first 35 miles-per-hour­speed-limit sign to when Officer Maeshiro obtained the laser
 gun's speed reading to conform his conduct to the requirements of
 the criminal law. We conclude that the State introduced 
9/ The actual intoxilyzer BAC reading introduced at trial was .113%, but
the majority held that the thousandth-place digit (.003%) should have been
redacted because it was irrelevant given the margin of error. Dibenedetto, 80
Hawai'i at 145, 906 P.2d at 631.
