STATE OF HAWAI rI, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JOAQUIN AYRES, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 

 (CR. NO. 09-1-0227)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Joaquin Ayres, Jr. (Ayres) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, entered on
 December 14, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit
 
(circuit court).

Ayres pleaded guilty to Criminal Contempt of Court in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 710-1077(1)(g)
 
(1993).

 On appeal, Ayres contends (1) the circuit court erred

 by failing to join the Criminal Contempt charge in this case with
the Disorderly Conduct and Harassment charges pending in 5P109­
0566, (2) his plea was not knowing and voluntary because he was

Ayres personally filed a document styled as a "Motion" on
January 14, 2010, which this court treats as a notice of appeal. Although
untimely, "[i]n criminal cases,[the supreme court] ha[s] made exceptions tothe requirement that notices of appeal be timely filed." State v. Irvine, 88 
Hawairi 404, 407, 967 P.2d 236, 239 (1998). The recognized exceptions include
"circumstances where . . . defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectivelyfailed to pursue a defendant's appeal from a criminal conviction in the firstinstance[.]" Id.

not informed that the charge in the case must be tried with
 
5P109-0566, and (3) he was provided with ineffective assistance
 
of counsel because his trial counsel failed to inform him that
 
this case must be tried with 5P109-0566.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Ayres's points of error as follows:
 
The Criminal Contempt charge is based upon Ayres's
 
failure to appear in court. None of the elements of HRS § 701­
1077 overlap with Harassment, HRS § 711-1106 (Supp. 2010), or
 
Disorderly Conduct, HRS § 711-1101 (Supp 2010). Therefore, the
 
charge in this case was not required to be tried together with
 
those in case No. 5P109-0566, pursuant to HRS § 701-109 (1993). 
State v. Kipi, 72 Haw. 164, 169-70, 811 P.2d 815, 817-18 (1991).
 
Since Ayres's two cases were not required to be tried
 
together, his guilty plea was not affected by any failure to be
 
informed of such a right. Therefore, Ayres has failed to show
 
his plea was not knowing and voluntary and Ayres's trial counsel
 
was not ineffective because she was not required to inform Ayres
 
that the two cases were required to be tried together.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence, entered on December 14, 2009 in the Circuit Court
 of the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai
ri, March 31, 2011. 
On the briefs:
 
Daniel G. Hempey, Presiding Judge
for Defendant-Appellant.

Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, Associate Judge
