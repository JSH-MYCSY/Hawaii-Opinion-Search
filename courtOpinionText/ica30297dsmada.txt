NO. 30297
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
SYLVIA CABRAL,
Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant, 
v.
 
PALISADES POINTE ESTATES, INC., EDWARD LEE BATES, et al.,
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff/Appellee,
 
and
 
GREAT AMERICAN HOTELS AND RESORTS, INC.,
Intervenor-Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 03-1-0212)
 
ORDER GRANTING JULY 8, 2010 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff/
 
Appellee Palisade Pointe Estates, Inc. (Appellee Palisade Pointe
 
Estates) and Defendant-Appellee Edward L. Bates's (Appellee
 Bates) July 8, 2010 motion to dismiss appellate court case number
 30297 for lack of jurisdiction, and (2) the record, and in
 consideration of (3) Plaintiff/Counterclaim-Defendant/Appellant
 Sylvia Cabral's (Appellant Cabral) lack of response to Appellee
 Palisade Pointe Estates and Appellee Bates's July 8, 2010 motion
 to dismiss appellate court case number 30297 for lack of
 jurisdiction, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over the
 appeal that Appellant Cabral as asserted from the Honorable
 Joseph F. Cardoza's December 3, 2009 "Order of the Hearing Held
 October 30, 2009 on Various Motions and Various Submissions Filed
 by Plaintiff Sylvia Cabral" and December 3, 2009 "Order Expunging
 Bureau Filing" (hereinafter "the two December 3, 2009
 interlocutory orders") because the record on appeal does not
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appear to contain a valid, appealable, final judgment pursuant to 
Rule 58 of the Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and even 
assuming, arguendo, that these two interlocutory orders are appealable, Appellant Cabral's January 14, 2009 notice of appeal is not timely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2009) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c) (1993 & Supp. 2009). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58. Based on this requirement under HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after 
the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "An 
appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). 
In the instant case, the circuit court appears to have
 
entered two appealable, final judgments: (1) a November 6, 2003
 default judgment, and (2) an October 21, 2008 judgment that
 dismissed all claims in this case. However, it appears that the
 circuit court set aside these two judgments through orders that
 the circuit court entered on December 3, 2009, and January 21,
 2009, respectively. Consequently, it appears that the record on
 appeal does not contain a valid, appealable, final judgment. 
Absent a valid, appealable, final judgment, the two December 3,
 2009 interlocutory orders are not appealable unless they satisfy
 the requirements for interlocutory appeals pursuant to the Forgay
 v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine (the Forgay doctrine),
 the collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b). Even assuming,
 arguendo, that the two December 3, 2009 interlocutory orders
 satisfy all the requirements for the Forgay doctrine, the
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
collateral order doctrine, or HRS § 641-1(b), Appellant Cabral
 
did not file her January 14, 2010 notice of appeal within thirty
 days after entry of the two December 3, 2009 interlocutory
 orders, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required. Therefore, Appellant
 Cabral's appeal from the two December 3, 2009 interlocutory
 orders is untimely.
 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice thereof is authorized to change the jurisdictional
 requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee Palisade Pointe
 
Estates and Appellee Bates's July 8, 2010 motion to dismiss
 appellate court case number 30297 for lack of jurisdiction is
 granted, and this appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate
 jurisdiction.
