APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2003-351 (2-02-10629))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant Billy L. Hitchcox ("Hitchcox")
 
appeals from the December 15, 2009 Decision and Order
 
("Decision") of the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board
 ("LIRAB"). 
On August 5, 2002, Hitchcox was involved in a work-
related motor-vehicle accident. On July 17, 2003, the Director
 of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Disability
 Compensation Division ("Director") awarded Hitchcox medical
 benefits for injuries to his neck and left shoulder and temporary
 total disability ("TTD") benefits through April 22, 2003, but
 denied medical benefits for Hitchcox's diplopia and vertigo
 conditions. On appeal, the LIRAB concluded in its Decision —
 which contains enumerated findings of fact ("FOF") and
 conclusions of law ("COL") — that, among other things, Hitchcox's
 diplopia and vertigo conditions did not relate to the accident
 and that Hitchcox is not entitled to medical care benefits for
 these conditions; that Hitchcox was not entitled to TTD benefits
 after April 23, 2003; and that Hitchcox was entitled to 3%
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
permanent partial disability ("PPD") stemming from his neck
 
injury. 
On appeal, Hitchcox contends that the LIRAB erred in
 
finding that (1) his diplopia and vertigo conditions were not
 related to his injuries stemming from the August 5, 2002
 accident; (2) he is not entitled to medical care for the diplopia
 and vertigo conditions; (3) he is not entitled to TTD benefits
 after April 22, 2003; and (4) he is only entitled to 3% PPD for
 injuries to his neck. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, we resolve Hitchcox's points of error
 as follows:
 
(1) Pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
("HRAP") Rule 28(b)(4), an opening brief must contain a concise statement of the points of error. Each point of error must state, among other things, "where in the record the alleged error occurred[.]" Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4)(ii). Where the point of error "involves a finding or conclusion of the court or agency," it must include "either a quotation of the finding or conclusion urged as error or reference to appended findings and conclusions[.]" Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4)(C). 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has repeatedly held that 
where findings of fact are not challenged or identified in the points of error, such findings are binding on appeal. See, e.g., 
'Ôlelo: The Corp. for Cmty. Television v. Office of Info. 
Practices, 116 Hawai' i 337, 349–50, 173 P.3d 484, 496-97 (2007); 
In re Lock Revocable Living Trust, 109 Hawai' i 146, 154, 123 P.3d 
1241, 1249 (2005); Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Prods., 86 Hawai'i 214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997); Leibert v. Fin. 
Factors, Ltd., 71 Haw. 285, 288, 788 P.2d 833, 835 (1990). Furthermore, "[i]f a finding is not properly attacked, it is binding; and any conclusion which follows from it and is a correct statement of law is valid." Kawamata Farms, 86 Hawai' i 
at 252, 948 P.2d at 1093 (quoting Wisdom v. Pflueger, 4 Haw. App. 455, 459, 667 P.2d 844, 848 (1983)). Hitchcox's points of error do not identify a single FOF as being erroneous. Thus, the LIRAB's unchallenged FOF are binding on appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
An appellant may be spared from the effects of this
 
rule when the opening brief "sufficiently satisfie[s]" HRAP Rule
 
28. Marvin v. Pflueger, 127 Hawai' i 490, 497, 280 P.3d 88, 95 
(2012). For instance, in Marvin, the supreme court held that an opening brief sufficiently satisfied HRAP Rule 28 — despite the failure to challenge specific FOF — where the brief challenged a COL which was redundant of the unchallenged FOF, the FOF were challenged in the analysis section of the brief, the identical arguments were raised below, and the arguments were conspicuous. Id. at 497–98, 280 P.3d at 95–96. 
Hitchcox's opening brief, however, does not
 
sufficiently satisfy HRAP Rule 28. Here, Hitchcox's first point
 of error is that the LIRAB erred in finding that his diplopia and
 vertigo conditions were unrelated to his work injury. This point
 of error clearly references COL 1: that Hitchcox's "vertigo and
 diplopia conditions are not related to the August 5, 2002 work
 injury." COL 1, however, is not merely a restatement of the
 unchallenged FOF; instead, the supporting FOF are distinct
 factual findings that form the substantive basis for COL 1. 
Thus, Marvin is of no help to Hitchcox. See Wisdom, 4 Haw. App.
 
at 459, 667 P.2d at 848 ("[A]n attack on a conclusion which is
 supported by a finding is not an attack on that finding.").
 
Furthermore, the argument section of Hitchcox's opening 
brief does not identify how any of the LIRAB's specific FOF were clearly erroneous; instead, Hitchcox presents his theory of the case without addressing or even acknowledging the LIRAB's contrary findings and conclusions. Because we review the LIRAB's FOF under the clearly erroneous standard, Nakamura v. State, 98 Hawai'i 263, 267, 47 P.3d 730, 734 (2002), and because Hitchcox 
has not challenged any of the FOF, those FOF are binding. 
We also note that Hitchcox failed to state where any of
 
his arguments were raised in the proceedings below, as required
 by HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(iii), and did not refer to a single case,
 statute, or administrative rule in his opening brief in violation
 of HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). Furthermore, due to the opening brief's
 complete lack of citations to specific FOF, it is not obvious how
 the collection of facts in the argument section relate to the
 
3
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
points of error or are intended to impeach the various FOF; thus,
 
any arguments challenging the FOF are not conspicuous.1
 
The unchallenged FOF support the LIRAB's conclusion
 
that Hitchcox's "vertigo and diplopia conditions are not related
 to the August 5, 2002 work injury." Therefore, Hitchcox has not
 shown error.
2
 
(2) Hitchcox challenges COL 2: that he "is not entitled 
to medical treatment for vertigo and diplopia." COL 2 is supported by the unchallenged FOF and COL 1. Furthermore, Hitchcox cites to no authority in support of his position. Thus, Hitchcox has not shown error. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4), (b)(7); Kawamata Farms, 86 Hawai' i at 252, 948 P.2d at 1093. 
(3) Hitchcox challenges COL 3: that he "is not entitled 
to TTD benefits after April 23, 2003." COL 3 is based on FOF 55–56, in which the LIRAB found, among other things, that Hitchcox "reached maximum medical improvement for his August 5, 2002 neck and left shoulder injury by April 3, 2003." Hitchcox fails to present an argument establishing that such findings are clearly erroneous. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). Furthermore, Hitchcox fails to refer to any authority establishing that COL 3 was erroneous as a matter of law and otherwise fails to argue or demonstrate that the LIRAB's decision was "[a]rbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion." Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 
97 Hawai' i 402, 405–06, 38 P.3d 570, 573–74 (2001) (quoting H
AW. 
REV. STAT. § 91-14(g)(6) (1993)). Thus, we reject Hitchcox's 
position. 
(4) Hitchcox challenges COL 4: that he was "entitled to
 
3% PPD of the whole person for his cervical spine, as a result of
 the August 5, 2002 cervical strain injury." Given his failure to
 address the merits of this case within the framework of this
 court's authority to review the LIRAB's decisions, see Igawa, 97
 
1
 Despite the fact that both appellees' answering briefs prominently
argued that Hitchcox's opening brief failed to properly challenge any FOF,
Hitchcox did not file a reply brief or seek leave to amend his opening brief. 
2
 Appellant's opening brief is replete with violations of HRAP Rule
28(b). Counsel is warned that future violations may result in sanctions pursuant
to HRAP Rule 30.

Hawai'i at 405–06, 38 P.3d at 573–74, or to present any authority 
in support of his arguments, Hitchcox also fails to show that the
 
LIRAB abused its discretion or erred as a matter of law. H AW.
 
REV.  STAT. § 91-14(g).
 
Therefore, the December 15, 2009 Decision and Order is
 
affirmed.
