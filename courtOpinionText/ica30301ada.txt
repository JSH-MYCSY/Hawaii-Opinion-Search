OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, PRESIDING J.
 
Respondent/Appellant-Appellant Hawai' i State Teachers 
Association (HSTA) appeals from the Judgment (Judgment) filed on 
December 16, 2009 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit3 
(circuit court). The circuit court entered judgment in favor of Agency/Appellee-Appellee Hawai' i Labor Relations Board (HLRB) and 
Complainants/Appellees-Appellees then-Governor Linda Lingle (Lingle) and then-Chief Negotiator Marie Laderta (Laderta) 
(collectively, Complainants) and against HSTA pursuant to (1) the 
"Order Granting Agency-Appellees Hawaii Labor Relations Board, et 
al.'s Joinder in Complainants-Appellees Linda Lingle and Marie 
Laderta's Motion to Dismiss Appeal Filed February 26, 2009, Filed 
on June 4, 2009," filed July 16, 2009 (Order Granting Joinder), 
and (2) the "Order Granting Complainants-Appellees Linda Lingle 
and Marie Laderta's Motion to Dismiss Appeal Filed May 18, 2009," 
filed August 12, 2009 (Order Granting Motion to Dismiss Appeal). 
The circuit court dismissed HSTA's appeal from HLRB's Order 
No. 2573 (Order No. 2573) for lack of appellate jurisdiction, 
determining that Order No. 2573 was not a final decision and 
order within the meaning of Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 72. 
On appeal, HSTA contends:
 
(1) The circuit court erred by dismissing an appeal
 
from an agency decision and order, which was "final" within the
 meaning of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 91-14(a) (1993), as it
 
determined the rights of the parties under Appendix II (Appendix
 
II) to the July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009 Collective Bargaining

 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang presided.

4
Agreement (CBA) for collective Bargaining Unit 5 (Unit 5)  and
HRS Chapter 89.
 
(2) The circuit court erred by deferring judicial
 
review of a "preliminary" ruling of a nature that deprived HSTA
 
of adequate and timely relief under an agreement on alcohol and
 
drug testing with a June 30, 2009 expiration date.
 
(3) The circuit court erred by misconstruing and
 
misapplying the collateral order doctrine to resolve claims of
 
rights separable from and collateral to rights asserted on the
 
merits that required immediate judicial review.
 
(4) HLRB erred by assuming jurisdiction over an
 
untimely prohibited practice complaint filed by Complainants, who
 
lacked standing as an "employer" under Appendix II over alcohol
 
and drug testing procedures.

In November 2006, HSTA and the Employer Group  began
negotiations over the proposed terms of the CBA. Negotiations 
pertaining to drug and alcohol testing were referred to a drug 
and alcohol subcommittee, wherein Guy Tajiri represented the 
Employer Group and Raymond Camacho (Camacho) represented HSTA. 
Concurrently, the Hawai' i State Legislature considered Senate 
Bill 96, which called for reasonable suspicion testing 
and random 
testing of Department of Education (DOE) teachers to obtain 
verifiable information regarding the use of controlled 
substances. Roger Takabayashi, president of HSTA, testified 
before the House Committees on Finance, Education, and Labor and 
Public Employment, and the House Judiciary Committee that the

 Pursuant to HRS § 89-6(5) (Supp. 2010), Unit 5 employees are:
"Teachers and other personnel of the department of education under the same
pay schedule, including part-time employees working less than twenty hours a
week who are equal to one-half of a full-time equivalent[.]"

 For purposes of negotiation of the Unit 5 CBA, the Employer Group
members were representatives of the Governor, the Board of Education, and the
Department of Education. HRS § 89-2 (Supp. 2010).

bill should be held in committee because HSTA had "already
 
included language in its contractual proposal for a drug testing
 
program designed to achieve the same ends as those set forth in
 
the bill before us."
 
In April 2007, the drug and alcohol testing
 
subcommittee submitted to the full negotiating committee its
 
proposed "HSTA Bargaining Unit 05 Drug and Alcohol Testing
 
Agreement." The agreement addressed "reasonable suspicion"
 
testing, but made no reference to "random" testing.
 
On April 11, 2007, the Employer Group submitted the
 
"Employer's Last, Best and Final Offer" in hope of obtaining a
 
tentative agreement with Unit 5. The offer provided in part: 
"All BU 05 members shall be subject to random controlled
 
substance and alcohol testing, as well as controlled substance
 
and alcohol testing on the basis of reasonable suspicion."
 
On April 17, 2007, representatives of the Board of
 
Education (BOE), DOE, and HSTA initialed a tentative agreement
 
titled "Memorandum of Understanding Between State of Hawaii[,]
 
Board of Education and Hawaii State Teachers Association (Drug
 
and Alcohol Testing)" (MOU). Pursuant to the MOU, HSTA and BOE
 
agreed to "establish a [sic] reasonable suspicion and random Drug
 
and Alcohol Testing (DAT) procedures applicable to all [Unit 5]
 
employees." HSTA and BOE also agreed that the procedures would
 
"comply with the U.S. Department of Transportation Rules on Drug
 
and Alcohol Testing and/or State Department of Health Rules on
 
Substance Abuse Testing." The parties agreed to implement such a
 
plan no later than June 30, 2008. The MOU was to be effective
 
from July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2009. The parties also
 
initialed a tentative agreement regarding step and 4% "across­
the-board" salary increases in 2007, 2008, and 2009; the language
 
in this agreement mirrored the language in the "Employer's Last,
 
Best and Final Offer."

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HSTA presented a "Ratification Copy 2007-2009" to its
 
Unit 5 members for approval. The proposed MOU was included in
 
the Ratification Copy as a proposed "new agreement." In addition
 
to including the same wording as proposed in the tentative MOU,
 
the following explanation was provided:
 
This MOU allows [HSTA] to work with the Department [sic] to
develop specific procedures for random drug testing and
reasonable suspicion to ensure due process rights for
teachers. Principals will not select teachers for random
drug testing, nor will they or the DOE administer or read
the results of the testing. An independent, certified
laboratory will be contracted to do the testing. 
Additionally a bill is moving in the Legislature that
requires the DOE to establish procedures for random drug
testing and reasonable suspicion, without a guarantee that
[HSTA] would be involved.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
On May 2, 2007, HSTA sent a letter, by certified mail,
 
to Lingle, informing her that "[t]he teachers of the [HSTA] have
 
ratified the 2007-2009 [CBA]." The MOU was incorporated as
 
Appendix II in the CBA.
 
On November 15, 2007, BOE provided HSTA with an initial
 
supplemental agreement regarding drug and alcohol testing
 
procedures, including procedures for random and reasonable
 
suspicion tests. On February 28, 2008 and May 9, 2008, HSTA
 
submitted requests to DOE for "Bargaining Information on Drug and
 
Alcohol Testing." HSTA counter-proposed on June 7, 2008 a
 
supplemental agreement that prohibited BOE from conducting random
 
alcohol testing and limited random drug testing to eight
 
categories of employees. Representatives of HSTA and BOE held
 
numerous negotiations between June 19, 2008 and July 8, 2008. 
HSTA presented a second draft of its proposed supplemental
 
agreement dated June 30, 2008 to the bargaining team.
 
On July 17, 2008, HSTA notified DOE Superintendent
 
Patricia Hamamoto (Hamamoto) that it would agree to "reasonable
 
suspicion drug and alcohol testing procedures," but would not
 
agree to "random drug and alcohol testing procedures" due to
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
concerns about possible state and federal constitutional
 
violations. HSTA filed a petition on July 18, 2008 with HLRB for
 
a declaratory ruling as to "the lawful scope of bargaining under
 
applicable state and federal statutes and rules relating to
 
random (or suspicion-less) alcohol and drug testing" of Unit 5
 
employees.
 
Also on July 18, 2008, Complainants filed a Prohibited
 
Practice Complaint (Complaint) with HLRB, alleging, inter alia,
 
that HSTA "refused to negotiate procedures for truly 'random Drug
 
and Alcohol Testing (DAT) procedures applicable to all [Unit 5]
 
employees'" and thereby willfully violated HRS § 89-13(b) when
 
HSTA: 
a. Refused to bargain in good faith with the public
employer as required in section 89-9, HRS; 
b. Refused or failed to comply with the provisions ofsections 89-9 and 89-10, HRS; 
c. Violated the terms of the [CBA] covering the periodfrom July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2009, including but notlimited to Articles V, XVII, and XXIII; and 
d. 
Violated the [MOU], entered into on July 1, 2007 byand between the State of Hawaii, [BOE,] and the HSTAand attached as Appendix II to the above-referencedUnit 5 [CBA]. 
Complainants asked HLRB to order HSTA "to negotiate in good faith
 
the creation of truly random drug and alcohol testing applicable
 
to all [Unit 5] employees."
 
On July 30, 2008, HSTA filed a Motion to Dismiss 
Complaint (Motion to Dismiss Complaint), in which HSTA argued 
lack of standing; failure to name an indispensable party; failure 
to state a claim for relief regarding collective bargaining as 
defined in HRS Chapter 89; violation of Hawai' i Administrative 
Rules (HAR) § 12-42-42(f); and lack of jurisdiction over claims arising more than ninety days prior to July 18, 2008, in 
violation of HRS § 377-9(l) (1993) and HAR § 12-42-42(a).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On August 1, 2008, Complainants filed a "Motion to
 
Amend Prohibited Practice Complaint Filed July 18, 2008" and on
 
August 8, 2008, they filed a "Motion for Leave to File Second
 
Amended Prohibited Practice Complaint Filed July 18, 2008," which
 
HLRB granted on August 28, 2008. Complainants filed their
 
Amended Prohibited Practice Complaint [Amended Complaint], adding
 
Hamamoto and BOE as additional Complainants and Camacho as a
 
Respondent. The Amended Complaint also included additional
 
allegations against HSTA.
 
Complainants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on
 
September 15, 2008. On September 29, 2008, HLRB heard oral
 
arguments on HSTA's Motion to Dismiss Complaint and Complainants'
 
Motion for Summary Judgment. On October 8, 2008, BOE and
 
Hamamoto filed a motion to withdraw as Complainants; HLRB granted
 
the motion on October 15, 2008.
 
On January 28, 2009, HLRB issued Order No. 2573,
 
denying HSTA's Motion to Dismiss Complaint and Complainants'
 
Motion for Summary Judgment. HLRB found that Complainants had
 
standing to bring their claim; BOE was not an indispensable
 
party; the Complaint had been timely filed; Complainants had
 
stated a claim for relief; and there were genuine issues of
 
material fact, necessitating a hearing in this matter. HLRB
 
scheduled hearings on the merits of the Amended Complaint for
 
March 23 and 24, 2009.
 
HSTA and Camacho timely filed a Notice of Appeal in the
 
circuit court from Order No. 2573. On March 4, 2009, HSTA and
 
Camacho filed a motion with HLRB to continue the proceedings set
 
for March 23 and 24, 2009, and HLRB issued an order staying the
 
proceedings. 
In the circuit court, on May 18, 2009, Complainants
 
filed a "Motion to Dismiss Appeal Filed February 26, 2009"
 
(Motion to Dismiss Appeal). On June 4, 2009, HLRB filed "Agency-
Appellees Hawaii Labor Relations Board, et al.'s Joinder in

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Complainants-Appellees Linda Lingle and Marie Laderta's Motion to
 
Dismiss Appeal Filed February 26, 2009" (Joinder) and a
 
memorandum in support of Complainants' Motion to Dismiss Appeal.
 
On June 16, 2009, the circuit court heard Complainants'
 
Motion to Dismiss Appeal and HLRB's Joinder. The circuit court
 
subsequently filed the Order Granting Joinder and Order Granting
 
Motion to Dismiss Appeal.
 
HSTA filed a Notice of Appeal and, on August 24, 2009,
 
a First Amended Notice of Appeal from the circuit court's Order
 
Granting Joinder and Order Granting Motion to Dismiss Appeal. 
The appeal was docketed as No. 30003. On December 16, 2009, this
 
court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the
 
circuit court had not reduced the orders to a separate judgment.
 
On December 16, 2009, the circuit court filed the
 
Judgment, entering judgment in favor of Complainants and against
 
HSTA. HSTA timely appealed.
 
II.
 
A.	 SECONDARY APPEAL
 
"On secondary judicial review of an administrative
decision, Hawai' i appellate courts apply the same standard
of review as that applied upon primary review by the circuit
court." Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor & 
Indus. Relations, 70 Haw. 72, 80, 762 P.2d 796, 800-01
(1988). For administrative appeals, the applicable standardof review is set forth in [HRS] § 91-14 (2004), whichprovides: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are:
 
(1)	 In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or
 
(2)	 In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
 
(3)	 Made upon unlawful procedure; or
 
(4)	 Affected by other error of law; or
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(5)	 Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
 
(6)	 Arbitrary, capricious, or characterized by abuse
of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of
discretion.
 
HRS § 91-14(g). Pursuant to HRS § 91-14(g)(5),administrative findings of fact are reviewed under theclearly erroneous standard, which requires [the appellate]court to sustain its findings "unless the court is left witha firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been 
made." Bumanglag v. Oahu Sugar Co., Ltd., 78 Hawai' i 275,
279, 892 P.2d 468, 472 (1995) (block format and citation
omitted). Administrative conclusions of law, however, are 
reviewed under the de novo standard inasmuch as they are"not binding on an appellate court." Id. (block format and
citation omitted). "Where both mixed questions of fact and
law are presented, deference will be given to the agency'sexpertise and experience in the particular field and thecourt should not substitute its own judgment for that of the
agency." Dole Hawaii Div.-Castle & Cooke, Inc. v. Ramil, 71
Haw. 419, 424, 794 P.2d 1115, 1118 (1990). "To be granted
deference, however, the agency's decision must be consistent
with the legislative purpose." Camara v. Agsalud, 67 Haw.
212, 216, 685 P.2d 794, 797 (1984). 
Peroutka v. Cronin, 117 Hawai' i 323, 326, 179 P.3d 1050, 1053 
(2008) (brackets in original omitted).
 
B.	 MOTION TO DISMISS
 
Review of a motion to dismiss is based on the contents
 
of the complaint, the allegations of which we accept as true
and construe in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.
Dismissal is improper unless it appears beyond doubt that
the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his
claim which would entitle him to relief.
 
Bremner v. City & County of Honolulu, 96 Hawai' i 134, 138, 28 
P.3d 350, 354 (App. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation
 
omitted).
 
C.	 INTERPRETATION OF A STATUTE
 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law
reviewable de novo.
 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from the
language contained in the statute itself. And we must read
 statutory language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.

1068, 1078 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citations 
omitted; block quote format changed). 
D.	 JURISDICTION
 
The question of whether a court has jurisdiction to
consider a matter is reviewed applying the right/wrong
standard. A party's failure to timely request an agency
review hearing not only bars the agency from considering
that request, but also precludes the circuit court from
considering an appeal of the administrative decision. The
 agency may not enlarge its powers by waiving or extending
mandatory time limits. 
Tanaka v. Dep't of Hawaiian Home Lands, 106 Hawai' i 246, 249, 103 
P.3d 406, 409 (App. 2004) (citations omitted). 
III.
 
A.	 ORDER NO. 2573 WAS NOT A FINAL ORDER WITHIN THE
 
MEANING OF HRS § 91-14(a), AND, THEREFORE, THE
CIRCUIT COURT DID NOT ERR BY DISMISSING HSTA'S
 APPEAL.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 91-14(a), an aggrieved party may
 
appeal a final decision or order of an administrative agency:
 
(a) Any person aggrieved by a final decision and order in a
contested case or by a preliminary ruling of the nature that
deferral of review pending entry of a subsequent final
decision would deprive appellant of adequate relief is
entitled to judicial review thereof under this chapter[.]
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
A final order is "an order ending the proceedings,
 
leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Gealon v. Keala, 60
 
Haw. 513, 520, 591 P.2d 621, 626 (1979). However, "a final
 
judgment or decree is not necessarily the last decision of a
 
case. What determines the finality of an order or decree is the
 
nature and effect of the order or decree." In re Hawaii Gov't
 
Employees' Ass'n, Local 152, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, 63 Haw. 85, 88, 621
 P.2d 361, 364 (1980) (quoting In re Application of Castle, 54
 
Haw. 276, 278, 506 P.2d 1, 3 (1973). "[A]n order is not final if
 
the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the
 
matter is retained for further action." Gealon, 60 Haw. at 520,
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
591 P.2d at 626. In addition, "[t]he denial of a motion to
 
dismiss is generally not considered a final order." City of Park
 
Hills v. Public Serv. Comm'n of State of Mo., 26 S.W.3d 401, 404
 (Mo. Ct. App. 2000). 
HSTA contends that Order No. 2573 was a final order
 
because HLRB determined the substantive rights of the parties
 
when it found that (1) Complainants had stated a claim for
 
relief, (2) Complainants had standing to bring their claim, (3)
 
HLRB had jurisdiction to hear the claims, and (4) the requested
 
relief did not violate the definition of collective bargaining.
 Contrary to HSTA's contention that Order No. 2573 left 
nothing further to be determined, the order shows otherwise. In
 
the order, HLRB set an evidentiary hearing for March 23 and 24,
 
2009 "to determine whether there has been bad faith during
 
negotiations, and if there had been repudiation of the [CBA],
 
whether any repudiation was wilful." Clearly, the matter was
 
retained for further action, and the rights of the parties
 
remained undetermined because the evidentiary hearing had yet to
 
be held. See Gealon, 60 Haw. at 520, 591 P.2d at 626. 
The circuit court did not err when it determined it did
 
not have jurisdiction because Order No. 2573 was not a final
 order.
 
B.	 HSTA DID NOT ARGUE IN THE CIRCUIT COURT THAT ORDER
 
NO. 2573 WAS A "PRELIMINARY" RULING.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 91-14(a), an appealable "preliminary
 
ruling" is one that is "of the nature that deferral of review
 
pending entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive
 
appellant of adequate relief." HSTA contends the circuit court
 
deprived HSTA of adequate relief under HRS Chapter 89 when the
 
court declined to review the merits of Order No. 2573 as a
 
"preliminary ruling." HSTA argues that the circuit court "failed
 
to consider whether the preliminary ruling was of such a nature"
 
that deferring review would deprive HSTA of adequate relief.
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Although HSTA cites to the record below where it claims
 
it argued that the circuit court should consider the effect of
 
the preliminary ruling, we find no such argument in the record. 
HSTA cites to its April 27, 2009 opening brief in the circuit
 
court, where HSTA argued the issues of standing and indispensable
 
party, but did not raise the issue of preliminary ruling. HSTA's
 
reply brief referred only to those same two issues. At the
 
circuit court hearing on June 16, 2009, HSTA identified the
 
issues before the circuit court as follows: "[W]e're asking the
 
Court to find that [Order No. 2573] either is a final order,
 
because of the context in which the order is made; or two, that
 
it's a collateral order, which will allow [time] to have an
 
appeal, a timely appeal, at the present." Again, HSTA did not
 
ask for the circuit court to consider whether the order was a
 
preliminary ruling. Not until its opening brief before this
 
court did HSTA argue that Order No. 2573 was a "preliminary
 
ruling" meriting immediate review to resolve the "controversy
 
over a prohibited practice so it could implement the fruits of
 
its bargaining effort" with BOE before Appendix II expired on
 
June 30, 2009.
 
If an issue is not raised below, the appellate court 
will not consider it except as justice so requires. Bitney v. 
Honolulu Police Dep't, 96 Hawai' i 243, 251, 30 P.3d 257, 265 
(2001). Because HSTA did not argue "preliminary ruling" in the 
court below and justice does not require this court to consider 
the point on appeal, we decline to do so. 
C.	 THE CIRCUIT COURT DID NOT MISCONSTRUE AND MISAPPLY
 
THE COLLATERAL ORDER DOCTRINE.
 
HSTA contends that Order No. 2573 was immediately
 
reviewable because it resolved "claims of rights separable from
 
and collateral to rights asserted on the merits which required
 
immediate judicial review" under the collateral order doctrine.
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
13Generally, under the final judgment rule, an
interlocutory order is not appealable.  MDG Supply, Inc. v.
Ellis, 51 Haw. 480, 481, 463 P.2d 530, 531 (1969).  The
collateral order doctrine is a narrow exception to the final
judgment rule, Siangco v. Kasadate , 77 Hawai #i 157, 161, 883 P.2d
78, 82 (1994), and to avoid piecemeal appeals, a court should 
"be parsimonious in its application."  Id. at 83, 883 P.2d at
162.  The collateral order doctrine applies to 
orders falling "in that small class which finally
determine claims of right separable from, and
collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too
important to be denied review and too independent of
the cause itself to require that appellate
consideration be deferred until the whole case is
adjudicated." 
Association of Owners of Kukui Plaza v. Swinerton [& Walberg
Co.], 68 Haw. 98, 105, 705 P.2d 28, 34 (1985) (quoting Cohen
v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.
Ct. 1221, [1225-26] (1949)). 
Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai# i 319, 321,
966 P.2d 631, 633-34 (1998) (footnote omitted).
In rare instances, the appellate courts will consider
an interlocutory appeal that meets the collateral order
doctrine's three-pronged test.
In order to fall within the narrow ambit of the
collateral order doctrine, the "order must [1]
conclusively determine the disputed question, [2]
resolve an important issue completely separate from
the merits of the action, and [3] be effectively
unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment."
Siangco v. Kasadate, 77 Hawai# i 157, 161, 883 P.2d 78, 82
(1994) (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463,
468, 98 S. Ct. 2454, [2458] (1978)) (brackets in original).
Id. at 322, 966 P.2d at 634.
Here, HSTA contends that Order No. 2573 meets the
three-pronged test.  HSTA maintains that under the first prong,
the order conclusively determined issues HSTA raised in its
Motion to Dismiss Complaint, specifically:  (1) HLRB had
jurisdiction over the Amended Complaint, (2) Complainants had
standing, and (3) BOE was not an indispensable party.  RegardingFOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the second prong, HSTA states that Order No. 2573 resolved the
 
issues of standing and indispensable party, which were completely
 
separate from the merits of the case and the claim that HSTA
 
bargained in bad faith. HSTA maintains that under the third
 
prong, the order would be effectively unreviewable on appeal
 
because HSTA's rights pursuant to HRS Chapter 89 "would be lost." 
HSTA argues that its rights would be violated if it had to defend
 
against charges of bargaining in bad faith, only to have the
 
court determine on appeal of a final judgment that a party to the
 
proceedings did not have standing or an indispensable party was
 
not present.
 
Because the collateral order doctrine test is set out 
in the conjunctive, if one prong is not met, HSTA's argument 
fails. Abrams, 88 Hawai' i at 322, 966 P.2d at 634 ("The 
collateral order doctrine involves a three-part test, all elements of which must be met in order to invoke appellate 
jurisdiction."). 
HSTA fails to satisfy the first prong in that Order 
No. 2573 did not conclusively determine the disputed question. 
When HLRB considered HSTA's Motion to Dismiss Complaint, HLRB had 
to accept Complainants' allegations in the Complaint as true and 
interpret the allegations in the light most favorable to 
Complainants. Bremner, 96 Hawai' i at 138, 28 P.3d at 354. HLRB 
scheduled an evidentiary hearing, during which the parties would be able to raise those issues again. Thus, HLRB did not 
conclusively determine disputed questions, and the first prong is 
not met. 
The third prong of the collateral order doctrine rule
 
also is not met. To satisfy the third prong, Order No. 2573
 
would have to be effectively unreviewable on appeal from HLRB's
 
final judgment. The three issues that HSTA contends meet the
 
collateral order doctrine -- HLRB's jurisdiction, Complainants'

standing, and the indispensable party status of BOE -- are all
 
issues that HSTA can raise on appeal to the circuit court.
 
To satisfy the second prong, the issues of standing and
 
indispensable party status must be able to be resolved completely
 
separate from the underlying issues of whether HSTA repudiated
 
the CAB and negotiated in bad faith. Although HSTA may be able
 
to satisfy the second prong, because the first and third prongs
 
of the collateral order doctrine test are not met, we need not
 
address the second prong. Order No. 2573 is not a collateral
 
order and the circuit court did not misconstrue or misapply the
 
collateral order doctrine.
 
D.	 THIS COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION TO ADDRESS
 
HSTA'S POINT ON APPEAL THAT HLRB ERRED BY ASSUMING
 JURISDICTION OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT.
 
HSTA contends that Complainants were not involved in
 
the bargaining process over alcohol and drug testing procedures
 
under Appendix II and therefore lacked standing to file the
 
Complaint. HSTA also contends the Complaint was untimely filed. 
Based on Complainants' alleged untimely filing and lack of
 
standing, HSTA argues that HLRB erred when it determined it had
 
jurisdiction over the Complaint.
 
In this point on appeal, HSTA asks this court to review
 
some of the very issues of HLRB's Order No. 2573 that the circuit
 
court determined it did not have jurisdiction to review. "On
 
secondary judicial review of an administrative decision, Hawaii
 
appellate courts apply the same standard of review as that
 
applied upon primary review by the circuit court." Kaiser Found.
 
Health Plan, Inc. v. Dep't of Labor & Indus. Relations,
 Unemployment Ins. Div., 70 Haw. 72, 80, 762 P.2d 796, 800-01
 
(1988). Having concluded that the circuit court did not err when
 
it found it lacked jurisdiction to review Order No. 2573 until a
 
final order and decision had been entered, we conclude we also
 
lack jurisdiction to review the order.
