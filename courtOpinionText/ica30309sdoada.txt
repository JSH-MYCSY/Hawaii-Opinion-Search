1.	 Did the Court below error [sic] regarding its ignoring
[Ronald Alan Ober (Ober)] et al. keeping and/or
controlling both the [Second Street Property (SSP)]
and the $45,000 cash tender therefore? [sic] Likewise,
did the Court below error [sic] regarding its ignoring
the post-trial newly discovered evidence in the value
of said liquidated jewelry judgment, of which $45,000
is owned [sic] by [Ober] et al?
 
2.	 Did the Court below error [sic] regarding its ignoring
[Ober], et al. keeping and/or controlling both the
[Old Volcano Highway Property (OVHP)] and the now
$400,000 first lien secured tender therefore? [sic]
Likewise, did the Court below error [sic] regarding
its ignoring the post-trial newly discovered evidence
of the value of said two $100,000 notes secured by
valuable, sold hotel and development right?
 
3.	 Did the Court below error [sic] regarding the fact
that it relied upon double hearsay of a foreclosure of
said development rights verses [sic] at least 5 final
orders and 2 judgments which agree with the position
of [Lighter] et al?
 
4.	 Did the Court below error [sic] regarding its ignoring
other post-trial newly discovered evidence of the
value of said consideration being still wrongfully
kept by [Ober] et al, including in the well document
[sic] and supplemented motion by [Lighter] made
chiefly pursuant to Rules 60(b) HRCP?
 
5.	 Did the Court(s) error [sic] regarding multiple
rulings made herein despite failure of and/or
defective jurisdiction variously [sic] over subject
matter and unserved parties, as well as fraud on the
Court(s).
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and the
 
arguments made by the parties in light of the record in this case
 
and the applicable statutory and case authority, we resolve
 
Lighter's appeal as follows.
 
Lighter has failed to demonstrate that the Circuit 
Court abused its discretion when it denied his Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. Beneficial Hawai' i, Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai' i 159, 164, 
45 P.3d 359, 364 (2002). All of Lighter's points relate to the issue of whether good and sufficient consideration was given by 
him in the transactions regarding the OVHP and SSP. In the 
parties' first appeal in this case, Ober v. Lighter, 118 Hawai' i 
209, 187 P.3d 593, No. 26964 (App. Feb. 28, 2008) (mem.), this court decided that, as Lighter fraudulently induced Ober to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
convey the OVHP and to assign the Lease and Option to Purchase
 
the SSP, the Circuit Court was correct in ordering the rescission
 
of both transactions. Thus, whether there was consideration for
 
these transactions would not affect the validity of the judgment
 
and would not be a basis for granting his motion.
 
Similarly, whether Ober returned the items Lighter
 
tendered to Ober in consideration for these transactions would
 
not affect the validity of the judgment but may, if he did not
 
comply with the terms of the amended judgment following remand,
 
be the basis for a motion to enforce the amended judgment.
 
Therefore, the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit's
 
January 11, 2010 "Order Denying Eric Aaron Lighter's Motion For
 
Relief From Judgment (filed September 3, 2009)" is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 26, 2013.
