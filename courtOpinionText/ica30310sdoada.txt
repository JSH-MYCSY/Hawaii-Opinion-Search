APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-1936)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Tara Thomas, Donna Thomas, and
 
Jack Thomas (Appellants) appeal the December 30, 2009 Judgment of
 
1
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court)
dismissing Appellants' complaint.
 
On appeal, Appellants contend their complaint properly
 
pled claims for abuse of process and harassment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
1
 The Honorable Eden E. Hifo presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude
 
Appellants' appeal is without merit.
 
The filing of a garnishment proceeding to collect on a
 
judgment is not a willful act in the use of a process which is
 
not proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding, and thus,
 
not an abuse of process. Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., 119 Haw.
 
403, 412, 198 P.3d 666, 675 (2008). Additionally, an alleged
 misrepresentation of case authority in circuit court is not an
 
abuse of process. As well, the filing of a fraudulent conveyance
 
case in circuit court is not an abuse of process. Appellants'
 
harassment claim is derivative of their abuse of process claims
 
and therefore is equally without merit.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the December 30, 2009
 
Judgment of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
