(2009).3 At trial, Craig-Rodenhurst did not dispute any of the
 
facts related to the citation.
 
On appeal, Craig-Rodenhurst raises twelve points of
 
error ("POE") that fall into three categories: (1) the District
 
Court lacked jurisdiction over the case and should, therefore,
 have granted his motion to dismiss (POE 1-4 and 7-10); (2) the
 Judgment conflicted with the Hawai» i Supreme Court's decision in 
Public Access Shoreline Hawaii v. Hawai» i Cnty. Planning Comm'n, 
79 Hawai» i 425, 903 P.2d 1246 (1995) ("PASH") (POE 5 and 6); and 
(3) all other claims (POE 11 and 12).

 HAR ÿÿ 13-48-3 states in relevant part: 
No person shall engage in the following activities in
the Waikiki-Diamond Head Shoreline Fisheries Management
Area:
 
(1) 	Fish for, catch, take, injure, kill, possess, or
remove any finfish, octopus, shrimp, crab,
lobster, sea urchin, and all other marine life
and eggs thereof during the "closed to fishing"
period;
(2) 	Take, injure, kill, possess, or remove live
coral at any time includinq the "open to
fishing" period;
(3) 	Have or possess in the water, hook-and-line,
trap, net, spear, or any other fishing gear.
during the "closed to fishing" period;
(4) 	Between the hours of 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., use

or
 
(5) 	Have or possess in the water, trap or net except
thrownet or handnet to land hooked fish during
the "open to fishing" period.

 In its answering brief, the State, unprompted, advises that the
January 15, 2010 oral charge did not sufficiently apprise Craig-Rodenhurst ofthe nature and cause of the accusation against him, because it failed toinclude the phrase "spear, or any other fishing gear during the 'closed tofishing' period" or any reference to the statute that the defendant was
charged with violating. In such cases, "it is incumbent on the appellate
court [first] to ascertain . . . that the confession of error is supported bythe record and well-founded in law and [second] to determine that such error
is properly preserved and prejudicial." State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai
»i 333, 336,
3 P.3d 499, 502 (2000) (brackets in original) (quoting State v. Wasson, 76
Hawai»i 415, 418, 879 P.2d 520, 523 (1994)). 
Any inadequacy in the January 15, 2010 oral charge
notwithstanding, Craig-Rodenhurst was initially arraigned on April 7, 2009, atwhich time the charge would have initially been presented. Because the April
7, 2009 transcript was not provided to us as part of this record on appeal, wecan not evaluate the State's contention, and conclude that any such error has
not been properly preserved. Hoang, 93 Hawai
»i at 336, 3 P.3d at 502
("Hoang's failure to include the arraignment transcript in the record
effectively precludes this court from determining, as a matter of law, whether
the confession of error by the prosecution is justified.") Craig-Rodenhurstraised no objection pre- or post-trial or on appeal to the charge, conceding

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 affirm the Judgment and resolve Appellant's points of error as
 follows:
 
I. Jurisdictional Claims
 
District courts have jurisdiction over criminal
 
offenses punishable by fine or by imprisonment not exceeding one
 
year. H
AW. REV. STAT. ÿÿ 604-8 (Supp. 2010). The offense of spear
 
fishing in the Waikiki-Diamond Head Shoreline Fisheries
 Management Area during a "closed to fishing" period is a petty
 
5
misdemeanor. Haw. Admin. R. ÿÿ 13-48-6.  A crime is a petty
 misdemeanor if the maximum prison term does not exceed thirty
 
days. H
AW. REV. STAT. 701-107(4) (Supp. 2008).
 
Craig-Rodenhurst contends that the District Court erred
 
in denying his motion to dismiss and that the district court
 lacks jurisdiction because "[HAR ÿÿ 13-48-3] is a United States
 American law and not a law of the Hawaiian Kingdom. This law and
 acts committed against the Defendant violates [sic] his Hawaiian
 Constitutional Rights." (Brackets in original omitted.)
 
We have consistently held, however, that persons 
claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai» i are not exempt 
from the laws of the State of Hawai» i: 
Whatever may be said regarding the lawfulness of the
Provisional Government in 1893, the Republic of Hawai »i in 
1894, and the Territory of Hawai »i in 1898, the State of
Hawai»i was . . . and is now, a lawful government . . . .
Persons claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom of Hawai »i 
and not of the State of Hawai »i are not exempt from the laws
of the State of Hawai »i applicable to all persons (citizens
and non-citizens) . . . within the State of Hawai »i. 
that he had done what he was charged with doing, with his testimony and cross-
examination directed solely to the issue of the court's jurisdiction to
enforce the regulation against him. As a result, any incongruity between the
two oral charges would not have been prejudicial.

 The Hawai »i Department of Land and Natural Resources is authorized
to "establish, maintain, manage, and operate freshwater or marine fishingreserves, refuges, and public fishing areas" and to "make, adopt, and amendrules and may issue permits as it deems necessary for managing the fishing
reserves, refuges, public fishing areas, and other waters or lands under thejurisdiction or control of the State." H
AW. REV. STAT. ÿÿ 188-53(a) (1993).

State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai» i 43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 
2004); see also State v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai» i 219, 220, 883 P.2d 
641, 642 (App. 1994); State v. Jim, 80 Hawai» i 168, 172, 907 P.2d 
754, 758 (1995); State v. Rodenhurst, No. 30154, 2010 WL 4263538, 
*1 (Haw. Ct. App. October 29, 2010), cert. denied, No. SCWC­30154, 2010 WL 5167706, *1 (Haw. December 14, 2010). 
II. PASH Claims
 
Craig-Rodenhurst appears to argue that his conduct was 
constitutionally protected under the Hawai» i Supreme Court's 
decision in PASH, 79 Hawai» i 425, 903 P.2d 1246. He fails, 
however, to meet his burden to establish that his conduct should 
have been accorded constitutional protection. E.g., State v. 
Hanapi, 89 Hawai» i 177, 183, 970 P.2d 485, 491 (1998). 
III. All Other Claims
 
Craig-Rodenhurst's remaining POE, 11 and 12, are deemed
 
waived as they are unsupported by any argument. Haw. R. App. P.
 
28(b)(7) (points not argued may be deemed waived). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
 
January 15, 2010 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Honolulu Division, is affirmed.
