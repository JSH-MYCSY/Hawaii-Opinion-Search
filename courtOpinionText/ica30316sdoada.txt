APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-1789)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Hiroko Allen ("Allen") appeals from
 
the Final Rule 54(b) Judgment in Favor of Plaintiff J.L.P.
 
Robinson LLC on All Claims Against Defendant Hiroko Allen filed
 on December 28, 2009, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 ("Circuit Court").
1 The underlying basis of Allen's appeal is
 
that the Circuit Court erred in its Order Granting in Part and
 Denying in Part Plaintiff J.L.P. Robinson LLC's Motion to Confirm
 Annual Lease Rent or in the Alternative to Compel Arbitration,
 Filed June 24, 2009 ("Order on Motion to Confirm"), filed
 September 15, 2009.

As her specific points of error, Allen contends that
 
(1) the Circuit Court erred in failing to "treat" Plaintiff-
Appellee J.L.P. Robinson LLC's ("Robinson") June 24, 2009 motion

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
to confirm annual lease rent or in the alternative to compel
 
arbitration ("Motion to Confirm") "as a motion for summary
 judgment," as Allen's "numerous responses in opposition to
 Robinson's motion . . . raised numerous genuine issues of
 material fact" and that (2) various orders filed after the Motion
 to Confirm must be vacated because they incorporated the
 erroneous Order on Motion to Confirm. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, we resolve Allen's points of error as
 follows:
 
Pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
("HRAP") Rule 28(b), an opening brief must contain, as one of its sections, "[t]he argument, containing the contentions of the appellant on the points presented and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on." Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). "Points not argued may be deemed waived." Id. 
Here, Allen's contention is that the Circuit Court
 
erred in its Order on Motion to Confirm. Allen's argument,
 however, does not contain any citation to the record. More
 importantly, it does not explain how the Circuit Court erred
 other than stating, in full:
 
When viewing the record in the light most favorable to
Allen, the motion, when treated as a summary judgment
motion, should not have been granted. The record shows that
 there are numerous, genuine issues as to material facts and
that Robinson was not entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.
 
Allen's argument is wholly inadequate. See State v. Vinuya, 96 
Hawai'i 472, 486, 32 P.3d 116, 130 (App. 2001) (a conclusory 
statement is not an argument); see also State v. Kahanaoi, No. 
CAAP-12-0000021, 2012 WL 5359188, at *2 (Haw. Ct. App. Oct. 31, 2012) (SDO). 
Non-specific references on appeal to genuine issues of 
material fact allegedly presented to the court below on summary judgment do not constitute an appellate argument. In Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 117 Hawai' i 92, 176 P.3d 91 
(2008), for instance, Kamaka contended that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Goodsill. Her argument 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
on appeal consisted of a single paragraph, identifying four 
specific alleged genuine issues of material fact. As the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court noted in Kamaka, however, and as is true as well here: 
[Kamaka] fails to explain how such evidence was material to
the elements of her claim. Furthermore, she has offered
absolutely no argument contesting the trial court's
determination that Goodsill was entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. Thus, in failing to explain the reasons for
 
her contentions, we hold that Kamaka has waived this point
pursuant to HRAP Rule 28(b)(7) (2007).
 
Id. at 108, 176 P.3d at 107.
 
Similar to the appellant's argument in Kamaka, in one
 
segment of the background section of her opening brief, Allen
 
cites to several of what she contends are "genuine issues of
 material fact" and also to then-Circuit Court Judge McKenna's
 rationale for rejecting Allen's arguments, but does not explain
 why the Circuit Court erred or how she is entitled to vacatur. 
One sentence in the last paragraph of the background section is
 telling: 
"As will be demonstrated below, all of the trial
 
court's orders and judgment must be vacated." Allen failed in
 
this regard.3
 
In sum, Allen failed to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b)(7)
 
or to present discernable legal arguments in support of her
 points of error. Thus, her points are waived. Haw. R. App. P.
 28(b)(7). This being the case, Allen's opening brief presents no
 argument for this court to consider.
 
Therefore, the December 28, 2009 Final Rule 54(b)
 
Judgment in Favor of Plaintiff J.L.P. Robinson LLC on All Claims

 Allen's counsel requested three separate extensions to file the
opening brief. The second request was received by the Supreme Court Clerk
after the brief was due, and the third request was filed ten minutes before
the deadline. These requests were ultimately granted. Notwithstanding these
extensions, the opening brief was then filed late. 
After Robinson filed its answering brief, Allen filed a
substantially oversized, twenty-page reply brief and, simultaneously, a motion
to file an over-sized reply brief less than two hours before the reply brief
was due. The length of the reply brief was, quite apparently, related to the
opening brief's lack of substance. This court struck the reply brief and
directed Allen to file a reply brief not exceeding ten pages, confined to
matters presented in the answering brief. Of course, arguments made in the
reply brief will not remedy the deficiencies in the opening brief. See In re
 
DQ, No. 29758, 2011 WL 5142023, at *2 n.2 (Haw. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2011) (SDO);
Pleus v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals for the City & Cnty. of Honolulu, No. 28353,
2010 WL 2181496, at *13 n.9 (Haw. Ct. App. May 28, 2010).
