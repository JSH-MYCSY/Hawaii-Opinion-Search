FOLEY, PRESIDING J., FUJISE AND LEONARD, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, J. 
Petitioner-Appellant Tawhiri Power LLC (Tawhiri Power) 
appeals from the "Order: (1) Granting Hawaii Electric Light 
Company, Inc.'s Motion to Intervene; and (2) Denying Tawhiri 
Power LLC's Petition for Declaratory Ruling" (Dismissal Order) 
entered by Appellee State of Hawai
'i Public Utilities Commission 
(PUC) on December 1, 2009 and the "Order Denying Tawhiri Power LLC's Motion for Reconsideration and Stay" (Reconsideration 
Order) entered by PUC on January 7, 2010. FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Before we can consider Tawhiri Power's points on
 
appeal, we must determine whether this court has jurisdiction
 
over the appeal. 
I.
 
On March 10, 2005, in Decision and Order No. 21693 (D&O
 
No. 21693), PUC approved the "Restated and Amended Power Purchase
 
Agreement For As-Available Energy" (RAC) dated October 13, 2004
 
1
 and Intervenor-
 between Apollo Energy Corporation (Apollo)
Appellee Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. (HELCO).
 
On October 19, 2009, Tawhiri Power initiated a new
 
proceeding before PUC, petitioning for a declaratory ruling
 
regarding a dispute between Tawhiri Power and HELCO over the
 
interpretation of certain provisions of the RAC.
 
HELCO filed a motion to intervene on November 9, 2009. 
HELCO filed a motion to dismiss on November 10, 2009, in which it 
contended that Tawhiri Power's request for a declaratory ruling
 
was precluded by the binding arbitration provision of the RAC.
 
On December 1, 2009, PUC entered its Dismissal Order, 
granting HELCO's motion to intervene and, pursuant to Hawai
'i 
Administrative Rules (HAR) § 6-61-164, denying Tawhiri Power's petition for a declaratory ruling. 
On December 10, 2009, Tawhiri Power filed a "Motion for
 
Reconsideration and Stay of Order Denying Tawhiri Power LLC's
 
Petition for Declaratory Ruling," which PUC denied in its
 
Reconsideration Order filed on January 7, 2010.
 
On January 25, 2010, Tawhiri Power filed a notice of 
appeal with PUC. Tawhiri Power stated that, pursuant to Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 91-14 (1993 & Supp. 2010) and 269-15.5 
(2007 Repl.) and Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 3, it 
was appealing to this court from the Dismissal Order and the 
1
 Apollo's interest was assigned to Tawhiri Power on December 5, 2005.
As a result, Tawhiri Power replaced Apollo as a party to the RAC.

A. JURISDICTION
 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.
Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any stage of a cause of action. When reviewing a
case where the circuit court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction, the appellate court retains jurisdiction, not
on the merits, but for the purpose of correcting the error
in jurisdiction. A judgment rendered by a circuit court
without subject matter jurisdiction is void.
 
Lingle v. Hawai' i Gov't Employees Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL­
CIO, 107 Hawai' i 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005) (quoting 
Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai' i 152, 158-59, 977 P.2d 160, 166-67 
(1999)).
 
HRS § 91-14(g)(5) of the Hawaii Administrative
Procedure Act provides, [i]nter alia, that upon review of
the record, the court may remand the case for further
proceedings if the substantial rights of the petitioners may
have been prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are clearly erroneous in
view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on
the whole record. Under the clearly erroneous standard, the
court will reverse an agency's findings if the court is left
with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been
 made.

citation omitted).
 
B. INTERPRETATION OF A STATUTE
 
The interpretation of a statute is a question of law
reviewable de novo.
 
When construing a statute, our foremost
obligation is to ascertain and give effect to the
intention of the legislature, which is to be obtained
primarily from the language contained in the statute
itself. And we must read statutory language in the
context of the entire statute and construe it in a
 manner consistent with its purpose.

omitted) (quoting 
Amantiad, 90 Hawai' i at 160, 977 P.2d at 168).

III.
 
Tawhiri Power appealed PUC's Dismissal Order to this
 
2 3
court pursuant to HRS §§ 91-14 and 269-15.5.  HRS § 91-14(a)
 
provides that "[a]ny person aggrieved by a final decision and
 
order in a contested case . . . is entitled to judicial review." 
HRS § 91-14(b) provides that "[e]xcept as otherwise provided
 
herein, proceedings for review shall be instituted in the circuit
 
court." The exception to the rule that proceedings are
 
instituted in the circuit court is "where a statute provides for
 
a direct appeal to the intermediate appellate court." HRS
 
§ 91-14(b). HRS § 269-15.5 is such a statute, providing for a
 
2 HRS § 91-14(a) (1993) and (b) (Supp. 2010) provides in relevant part:
 
§91-14 Judicial review of contested cases. (a) Any person
aggrieved by a final decision and order in a contested case or by
a preliminary ruling of the nature that deferral of review pending
entry of a subsequent final decision would deprive appellant of
adequate relief is entitled to judicial review thereof under this
chapter; but nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent
resort to other means of review, redress, relief, or trial de
novo, including the right of trial by jury, provided by law.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the
contrary, for the purposes of this section, the term "person
aggrieved" shall include an agency that is a party to a contested
case proceeding before that agency or another agency.
 
(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, proceedings for
review shall be instituted in the circuit court within thirty days
after the preliminary ruling or within thirty days after service
of the certified copy of the final decision and order of the
agency pursuant to rule of court, except where a statute provides
for a direct appeal to the intermediate appellate court, subject
to chapter 602. In such cases, the appeal shall be treated in the
same manner as an appeal from the circuit court to the
intermediate appellate court, including payment of the fee
prescribed by section 607-5 for filing the notice of appeal
(except in cases appealed under sections 11-51 and 40-91). The
 court in its discretion may permit other interested persons to
intervene.

 HRS § 269-15.5 provides in relevant part:
 
§269-15.5 Appeals.  An appeal from an order of the public
utilities commission under this chapter shall lie, subject to
chapter 602, in the manner provided for civil appeals from the
circuit courts. Only a person aggrieved in a contested case
proceeding provided for in this chapter may appeal from the order,
if the order is final, or if preliminary, is of the nature defined
by section 91-14(a).

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
direct appeal to this court from an order of PUC. The order must
 
be from a contested case proceeding. HRS § 269-15.5.
 
The Hawai' i Legislature enacted HRS § 269-15.5 in 
response to the Hawai' i Supreme Court's holding in Peterson v. 
Hawaii Elec. Light Co., Inc., 85 Hawai' i 322, 327, 944 P.2d 1265, 
1270 (1997), superseded on other grounds by HRS § 269–15.5, that
 
PUC non-ratemaking cases were not directly appealable to the
 
supreme court.4 As the Legislature explained, the supreme
 
court's decision 
that only rate-related orders of the PUC were appealable
directly to the Supreme Court and that other PUC orders must
be appealed to the Circuit Court prior to an appeal to the
Supreme Court, is not aligned with the practices of the PUC
and illustrates that the statutes regarding the appeals
process of PUC orders require clarification. This measure
 provides that all final orders issued by the PUC under
Chapter 269, [HRS], may be appealed by an aggrieved party in
a contested case proceeding directly to the Hawaii Supreme
Court.
 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1203-98, 1998 House Journal, at 1541. 
According to the Legislature, the purpose of enacting HRS
 
§ 269-15.5 was to "make all [PUC] orders appealable directly to
 
the Hawaii Supreme Court by an aggrieved party in a contested
 
case proceeding," which would help "utility companies and
 
consumers by expediting the appeal process for PUC decisions." 
H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1203-98, 1998 House Journal, at 1541. 
Regardless of the Legislature's desire to expedite the
 
appeals process in PUC cases, the Legislature specifically
 
provided that "[o]nly a person aggrieved in a contested case
 
proceeding provided for in this chapter may appeal from the
 
order." HRS § 269-15.5. 
A contested case is "a proceeding in which the legal
 
rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by
 
law to be determined after an opportunity for agency hearing." 
HRS § 91-1(5) (1993). HAR Chapter 61 ("Rules of Practice and

 The Hawai' i Legislature amended HRS § 269-15.5 in 2004 (effective
July 1, 2006) to change the appellate forum from the Hawai' i Supreme Court to
this court. 2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 202, § 28 at 928-29.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Procedure Before the Public Utilities Commission"), § 6-61-2 
defines "contested case" as having "the same meaning as in 
§ 91-1(5)." A proceeding is not a "contested case" if the 
proceeding is not required by statute or rule. Bush v. Hawaiian 
Homes Comm'n, 76 Hawai' i 128, 134, 870 P.2d 1272, 1278 (1994) 
("If the statute or rule governing the activity in question does 
not mandate a hearing prior to the administrative agency's 
decision-making, the actions of the administrative agency are not 
'required by law' and do not amount to 'a final decision or order 
in a contested case[.]'" (Emphasis omitted.)). "[D]iscretionary 
hearings are not contested cases because they are not required by 
law." Lingle, 107 Hawai' i at 184, 111 P.3d at 593. 
PUC issued its Dismissal Order pursuant to HRS § 91-8
 
5	 6
(1993) and HAR §§ 6-61-159, 6-61-162, and 6-61-164 (1992).  The
 
5 HRS § 91-8 provides:
 
§91-8 Declaratory rulings by agencies.  Any interested
person may petition an agency for a declaratory order as to the
applicability of any statutory provision or of any rule or order
of the agency. Each agency shall adopt rules prescribing the form
of the petitions and the procedure for their submission,
consideration, and prompt disposition. Orders disposing of
petitions in such cases shall have the same status as other agency
orders.
6 HAR §§ 6-61-159, 6-61-162, and 6-61-164 provide:
 
§6-61-159 Who may apply. On the petition of an interested
person, the commission may issue a declaratory order as to the
applicability of any statute or any rule or order of the
commission.
 
§6-61-162 Commission action. (a) Within forty-five days
after the submission of a petition for declaratory ruling, the
commission shall:
 
(1)	 Deny the petition in writing, stating the reasons for
that denial;
(2)	 Issue a declaratory order on the matters contained in
the petition; or
(3)	 Set the matter for hearing, as provided in subchapter
3.
 
(b) If the matter is set for hearing, the commission shall
render its findings and decision, unless otherwise indicated at
the time of the hearing, within thirty days after the close of the
hearing or, if briefs are filed, thirty days after the last brief
is filed.
 
(continued...)

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
administrative rules establish that a hearing on a petition for a 
declaratory ruling is a discretionary hearing and, therefore, not 
a contested case. HAR § 6-61-159 provides that an interested 
person may petition PUC to issue a declaratory order. Pursuant 
to HAR § 6-61-162, PUC may deny the petition, issue a declaratory 
order, or set the matter for hearing. HAR § 6-61-164 provides 
examples of reasons why PUC may deny the petition or refuse to 
issue a declaratory order.7 Because a hearing on a petition for 
a declaratory order before PUC is discretionary and not required by law, the Dismissal Order was not a contested case. Lingle, 
107 Hawai' i at 184, 111 P.3d at 593. Accordingly, because HRS 
§ 269-15.5 only applies to contested cases, Tawhiri Power was not 
entitled to appeal the Dismissal Order directly to this court. 
Tawhiri Power should have filed an appeal to the 
circuit court pursuant to HRS §§ 91-8 and 91-14. In Lingle, the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court held that "orders disposing of petitions 
for declaratory rulings under HRS § 91-8 are appealable to the 
6(...continued)
§6-61-164 Refusal to issue declaratory order. The
 
commission may, for good cause, deny the petition or refuse to
issue a declaratory order by giving specific reasons for that
determination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the commission may so refuse where:
 
(1)	 The question is speculative or purely hypothetical and
does not involve existing facts or facts that can be
expected to exist in the near future;
 
(2)	 The petitioner's interest does not give it standing to
maintain an action if petitioner were to seek judicial
relief;
 
(3)	 The issuance of the declaratory order may affect the
interest of the State in pending litigation or in
litigation that may reasonably be expected to arise;
 or
 
(4)	 The matter is not within the jurisdiction of the
commission.
7
 Additionally, HAR § 6-61-165 provides in part that "[a]lthough in the
usual course of disposition of a petition for a declaratory ruling no formal
hearing will be held, the commission may order a hearing."

circuit court pursuant to HRS § 91-14." Lingle, 107 Hawai' i at 
186, 111 P.3d at 595.
 
Because Tawhiri Power did not have the right to appeal
 
directly to this court, we lack jurisdiction over Tawhiri Power's
 
appeal.
