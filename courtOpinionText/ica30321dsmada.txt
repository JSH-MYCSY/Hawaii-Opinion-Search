NO. 30321
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
LAWRENCE DEMELLO, JR., Defendant-Appellant
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 2P108-02074)
ORDER GRANTING APRIL 6, 2010 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION WITHOUT PREJUDICE
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellant Lawrence
DeMello, Jr.'s (Appellant DeMello), April 6, 2010 motion to
dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction without
prejudice and (2) the record, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over Appellant DeMello's appeal from the Honorable
Kelsey T. Kawano's January 5, 2010 judgment of conviction
pursuant to Hawai# i Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 641-12 (Supp. 2009),
and, thus, Appellant DeMello's April 6, 2010 motion has merit.
"Appeals from the district court, in criminal cases,
are authorized by HRS ยง 641-12, which . . . provides in pertinent
part that appeals upon the record shall be allowed from all final
decisions and final judgments of district courts in all criminal
matters."  State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai #i 446, 449, 923 P.2d 388,
391 (1996) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  
However, the January 5, 2010 judgment in this case is not final,
because, although the January 5, 2010 judgment indicates the
district court's intent to sentence Appellant DeMello to
restitution, and the district court has not yet entered an order
or judgment that determines the specific amount of restitutionNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-that Appellant DeMello must pay.  Under similar circumstances in
an appeal from a district court judgment, the intermediate court
of appeals has held that:
[j]udgments of conviction are not final unless they
include the final adjudication and the final sentence. 
In the instant case, the sentence imposed was not the
final sentence because the district court expressly
left open the possibility that its sentence of Kilborn
might include an order requiring Kilborn to pay
restitution.  The court did not finally decide whether
it would order Kilborn to pay restitution and, if so,
in what amount.  Consequently, the December 5, 2003
Judgment is not final and, because it is not final, it
is not appealable.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
appeal from the December 5, 2003 Judgment is dismissed
for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
State v. Kilborn, 109 Hawai# i 435, 442, 127 P.3d 95, 102 (App.
2005).  Similarly in the instant case, the January 5, 2010
judgment and a March 31, 2010 order indicate that the district
court has intended to sentence Appellant DeMello to pay
restitution in an amount that the district court would determine
at a later date.  Consequently, the January 5, 2010 judgment is
not final, and, thus, the January 5, 2010 judgment is not
appealable under HRS ยง 641-12 (Supp. 2009).
Absent an order or judgment that specifically
determines the amount of restitution that Appellant DeMello must
pay as a part of his sentence, the sentence in this case is not
yet complete, and we lack appellate jurisdiction under HRS ยง 641-12. 
Therefore,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant DeMello's April 6,
2010 motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate
jurisdiction without prejudice is granted, and appellate court
case number 30321 is dismissed.  This order of dismissal does not
preclude Appellant DeMello from asserting a new appeal under aNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

makes Appellant DeMello's judgment of conviction final by
entering an appealable written order or judgment that determines
the amount of restitution that Appellant DeMello is required to
pay as a part of his sentence.
