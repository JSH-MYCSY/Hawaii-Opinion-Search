BENOIT MARIE BERNARD BASTIEN, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
DESIREE MARIE MORALES, Defendant-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(FC-D NO. )8-1-0590)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
Upon review of record, it appears that we do not have
jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant Benoit Marie Bernard
Bastien's (Appellant Bastien) appeal from the Honorable Keith E.
Tanaka's January 5, 2010 "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
with Respect to Property Division Submitted for Decision"
(Interlocutory Order) because, under the present circumstances,
the Interlocutory Order is not an appealable order pursuant to
Hawai i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 571-54 (2006).»
In family court cases "[a]n interested party aggrieved
by any order or decree of the court may appeal to the
intermediate appellate court for review of questions of law and
fact upon the same terms and conditions as in other cases in the
circuit court[.]"  HRS § 571-54.  In circuit court cases,
aggrieved parties may appeal from "final judgments, orders or
decrees[.]"  HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009).
Hawaii divorce cases involve a maximum of four
discrete parts: (1) dissolution of the marriage; (2) child
custody, visitation, and support; (3) spousal support;  and
(4) division and distribution of property and debts .  Black
v. Black, 6 Haw. App. [493], 728 P.2d 1303 (1986).  In
Cleveland v. Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977),
the Hawaii Supreme Court held that an order which finally
decides parts (1) and (4) is final and appealable even if
part (2) remains undecided.  Although we recommend that,NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-except in exceptionally compelling circumstances, all parts
be decided simultaneously and that part (1) not be finally
decided prior to a decision on all the other parts, we
conclude that an order which finally decides part (1) is
final and appealable when decided even if parts (2), (3),
and (4) remain undecided;  that parts (2), (3), and (4) are
each separately final and appealable as and when they are
decided, but only if part (1) has previously or
simultaneously been decided;  and that if parts (2), (3),
and/or (4) have been decided before part (1) has been
finally decided, they become final and appealable when part
(1) is finally decided.
Eaton v. Eaton , 7 Haw. App. 111, 118-19, 748 P.2d 801, 805 (1987)
(footnote omitted; emphases added).  The Interlocutory Order
relates to part (4) and the issue of dividing property in this
divorce case.  The record on appeal does not contain a judgment,
decree or order that finally determines part (1) of this divorce
case by dissolving the marriage.  Therefore, under the holding in
Eaton, the Interlocutory Order  is not an appealable order
pursuant to HRS § 571-54.  Absent an appealable judgment, decree
or order, Appellant Bastien's appeal is premature.  
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. 30325
is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
