IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JON BUONO, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 07-1-0243)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jon Buono (Buono) appeals from the
 
judgment entered on January 7, 2010 by the Circuit Court of the
 
1
Fifth Circuit (circuit court)  convicting him of unauthorized
control of a propelled vehicle in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes ยง 708-836 (Supp. 2005).
 
On appeal, Buono asserts one point of error, that the 
circuit court erred in denying his motion to dismiss pursuant to 
Rule 48 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). Buono 
specifically challenges the circuit court's ruling that, due to court congestion, the seventy-seven days between August 18, 2008 
and November 3, 2008 should be excluded from calculating the six 
month period under HRPP Rule 48.

 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) counters 
that HRPP Rule 48 was not violated, arguing that: the circuit 
court properly excluded the seventy-seven days because another 
trial ongoing before the circuit court unexpectedly extended into 
an extra week and Buono's counsel consented to rescheduling trial 
in the normal course to November 3, 2008; in the alternative, the 
seventy-seven days could be excluded for "good cause" under HRPP 
Rule 48(c)(8); and the period between August 3, 2009 and 
September 21, 2009 is excluded under HRPP 48(c)(1) and (3). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised therein, as well as
 
the relevant case law and authority, we resolve Buono's point of
 
error as follows:
 
(1) Under HRPP Rule 48(c)(2), "periods that delay the
 
commencement of trial and are caused by congestion of the trial
 
docket when the congestion is attributable to exceptional
 
circumstances" are excluded in computing the time for trial
 
commencement. The circuit court ruled that the seventy-seven day
 
period between August 18, 2008 and November 3, 2008 was excluded
 
due to court congestion because Buono's August 18, 2008 trial
 
date was continued as a result of the circuit court presiding
 
over another trial that unexpectedly ran into a third week. 
Excluding the seventy-seven day period, the circuit court found
 
160 days chargeable to the State, short of a HRPP Rule 48
 
violation.
 
A trial court's findings of fact (FOFs) in deciding an HRPP
Rule 48(b) motion to dismiss, are subject to the clearly
erroneous standard of review . . . . However, whether those
facts fall within HRPP Rule 48(b)'s exclusionary provisions
is a question of law, the determination of which is freely
reviewable pursuant to the "right/wrong" test.

The circuit court erred when it concluded that the
 
other trial pending before it constituted court congestion for
 
purposes of excluding the seventy-seven days under HRPP Rule 48. 
As set forth in HRPP Rule 48(c)(2), a period is excluded when
 
congestion of the trial docket is due to exceptional
 
circumstances. "In order for court congestion to qualify as
 
'exceptional,' as opposed to usual, there must be a showing of
 
deviation from the norm." State v. Caspino, 73 Haw. 256, 257,
 
831 P.2d 1334, 1335 (1992); see also State v. Kahawai, 9 Haw.
 App. 205, 831 P.2d 936 (1992). "Although it is fair to expect
 
the state to provide the machinery needed to dispose of the usual
 
business of the courts promptly, it does not appear feasible to
 
impose the same requirements when certain unique, nonrecurring
 
events have produced an inordinate number of cases for court
 
disposition." State v. Lord, 63 Haw. 270, 272, 625 P.2d 1038,
 
1039 (1981) (quoting commentary to the ABA Standards Relating to
 Speedy Trials) (emphasis added).
 
The supreme court has held for purposes of HRPP Rule 
48(c)(2) that there were exceptional circumstances causing court 
congestion in circumstances far different than this case. 
See 
State v. Baron, 80 Hawai
'i 107, 110, 905 P.2d 613, 616 (1995) 
(two judges were reassigned, one judge retired, one judge was 
temporarily assigned to another court, potential replacement 
judges were on vacation, and there was a marked increase in jury 
trial demands); State v. Herrera, 63 Haw. 405, 407, 629 P.2d 626, 
628 (1981) (the normal condition of the trial court's criminal 
division was affected because two of the four judges submitted 
their resignations and their workload was reduced so they could 
complete prior assignments, replacement judges were in place at 
different times, the number of judges was increased due to the 
workload, a newly assigned criminal judge had a limited schedule 
in order to complete his family court cases, new judges had 
limited assignments to familiarize themselves with the 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assignments, and there was an increase in the number of
 
indictments from fifteen to twenty-one cases per week to twenty-
three to twenty-five cases per week); Lord, 63 Haw. at 272-73,
 
625 P.2d at 1039-40 (there were two judges to handle both
 
criminal and civil cases and defendant's trial was continued
 
because there was "an inordinate number of criminal indictments
 
returned by the grand jury").
 
The instant case is unlike Baron, Herrera and Lord. 
Here, where one other trial unexpectedly extended into an
 
additional week, there was no exceptional circumstance meeting
 
the requirements of HRPP 48(c)(2). This was not a unique,
 
nonrecurring event or one that deviates from the norm. 
Therefore, it was error for the circuit court to exclude the
 
seventy-seven day period on this basis.
 
We agree in part, however, with the State's argument
 
that there was consent by Buono's counsel. Under HRPP 48(c)(3),
 
"periods that delay the commencement of trial and are caused by a
 
continuance granted at the request or with the consent of the
 
defendant or defendant's counsel" are excluded. (Emphasis
 
added). Buono's counsel objected to the circuit court's
 
determination that there was court congestion such that neither
 
party would be charged with the continuation period. However,
 
when asked if he wanted an expedited trial date or one in the
 
normal course, he responded "in the normal course" and the
 
circuit court thus set trial for November 3, 2008. In this
 
circumstance, we conclude that Buono's counsel consented to the
 
period that delayed trial between an expedited trial setting and
 
a trial setting in the normal course. The record does not
 
reflect when an expedited trial would have been set or the number
 
of days between an expedited trial and the trial set in the
 
normal course for November 3, 2008. We therefore remand to the
 
circuit court for further proceedings to make such findings, and
 
the period between an expedited trial setting and the November 3,
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2008 trial setting should be excluded in computing the time for
 
trial commencement for purposes of deciding Buono's motion to
 
dismiss.
 
(2) The State argues that the seventy-seven day period
 
may alternatively be excluded under HRPP Rule 48(c)(8) for "good
 
cause." The State did not argue "good cause" before the circuit
 
court and the circuit court did not make any such determination
 
in denying Buono's HRPP Rule 48 motion to dismiss. We therefore
 
do not reach this issue.
 
(3) With regard to the State's argument that the period
 
between August 3, 2009 and September 21, 2009 is excluded, that
 
issue was not addressed by the circuit court germane to Buono's
 
HRPP Rule 48 motion to dismiss, which was heard and decided on
 
August 4, 2009.2 We thus do not reach this issue. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the judgment entered on
 
January 7, 2010 is vacated and this case is remanded for further
 proceedings consistent with this decision. On remand, the
 
circuit court may also address the State's arguments that we do
 
not reach above.

 At the August 4, 2009 hearing, the circuit court did charge an eight
day period between August 3, 2009 and August 11, 2009 to the State based on a
motion to continue filed by the State. However, that period was not the focus
of Buono's motion to dismiss. Rather, the seventy-seven day period between
August 18, 2008 and November 3, 2008 was the determining factor.
