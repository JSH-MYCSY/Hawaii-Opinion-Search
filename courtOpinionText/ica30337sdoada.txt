OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TERRANCE E. ATWOOD, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 07-1-0635(4))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this interlocutory appeal, Defendant-Appellant
 
Terrance E. Atwood (Atwood) appeals from the Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Defendant's Motion to
 
Dismiss Count One (Order Denying Dismissal), filed on December
 
16, 2009, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit
 Court).

In an Indictment filed on October 12, 2007, Atwood was
 
charged with two counts, including Theft in the First Degree, by
 
deception, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708­
830.5(1)(a) (Supp. 2010), and with intent to deprive the
 
complainant of property, the value of which exceeded $20,000.00
 
(Count One), as follows:
 
That during or about the period of May 14, 2006,
through February 26, 2007, inclusive, in the Court of Maui,
State of Hawaii, TERRANCE E. ATWOOD did obtain or exert
control over the property of another, to wit, Jenwei Luu and

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
My Thi Do, to wit, United State [sic] Currency, the value of
which exceeded Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00), by
deception and with the intent to deprive Jenwei Luu and My
Thi Do of the property, thereby committing the offense of
Theft in the First Degree in violation of Section 708­830.5(1)(a) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.
 
On October 28, 2009, Atwood filed a motion to dismiss
 
Count One. After a hearing, the Circuit Court denied Atwood's
 
motion and issued the Order Denying Dismissal. Atwood was
 
permitted to file this interlocutory appeal.
 
In his points of error on appeal, Atwood contends the
 
Circuit Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss Count One
 
because: (1) the Circuit Court failed to consider or require the
 
mens rea necessary for theft by deception; and (2) the testimony
 
provided to the grand jury was insufficient to establish probable
 
cause because the evidence failed to establish the mens rea
 
necessary for theft by deception. Atwood also contends that
 
contractors are regulated pursuant to HRS Chapters 436, 436B, and
 
444, and, therefore, should not be criminally prosecuted under
 
the Hawaii Penal Code for Theft in the First Degree for
 
activities subject to such regulation. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Atwood's contentions as follows:
 
The applicable standard for our review is as follows:
 
A grand jury indictment must be based on probable
cause. Probable cause is established by a state of
facts as would lead a person of ordinary caution or
prudence to believe and conscientiously entertain a
strong suspicion of the guilt of the accused.
 
In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to
establish probable cause before the grand jury, every
legitimate inference that may be drawn from the
evidence must be drawn in favor of the indictment and
 neither the trial court nor the appellate court on
review may substitute its judgment as to the weight of
the evidence for [that of] the Grand Jury. 
The evidence to support an indictment need not be
sufficient to support a conviction.

State v. Yip , 92 Hawai' i 98, 105, 987 P.2d 996, 1003 (App. 1999) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
HRS § 708-830.5(1)(a) provides: 
§ 708-830.5 Theft in the first degree.  (1) A 
person commits the offense of theft in the first
degree if the person commits theft:
 (a) Of property or services, the value of
which exceeds $20,000;
 
Theft is defined, in relevant part, as:
 
§ 708-830 Theft.  A person commits theft if the
person does any of the following:
 
. . . .
 (2) 	 Property obtained or control exerted
through deception. 
A person obtains, or
exerts control over, the property of
another by deception with intent to
deprive the other of the property.
 
HRS § 708-800 further provides that:
 
"Deception" occurs when a person knowingly:
 (1) 	 Creates or confirms another's impression which
is false and which the defendant does not
 believe to be true;
 (2) 	 Fails to correct a false impression which the
person previously has created or confirmed;
 (3) 	 Prevents another from acquiring information
pertinent to the disposition of the property
involved;
 (4) 	 Sells or otherwise transfers or encumbers
 property, failing to disclose a lien, adverse
claim, or other legal impediment to the
enjoyment of the property, whether that
impediment is or is not valid, or is or is not a
matter of official record; or
 (5) 	 Promises performance which the person does not
intend to perform or knows will not be
performed, but a person's intention not to
perform a promise shall not be inferred from the
fact alone that the person did not subsequently
perform the promise.
 The term "deception" does not, however, include
falsity as to matters having no pecuniary
significance, or puffing by statements unlikely to
deceive ordinary persons in the group addressed.
"Puffing" means an exaggerated commendation of wares

or services in communications addressed to the public
or to a class or group.
 
The Circuit Court's use of civil contract law was 
error, as Atwood argues. However, such error was harmless 
because the Circuit Court properly found that probable cause to 
indict Atwood existed based on the fact that Atwood 
misrepresented that he was a licensed contractor, Atwood 
misrepresented his prior work, Luu relied on Atwood's 
misrepresentation, and Luu paid Atwood money for the project 
which cost $95,930.00. The evidence before the Grand Jury and 
every legitimate inference drawn from that evidence demonstrates 
that Atwood obtained $95,930.00 by deception of Luu with intent 
to deprive Luu of the money. Atwood knowingly created an 
impression that he was a licensed contractor by stating that he 
was a licensed contractor. Based on Atwood's misrepresentation 
of being a licensed contractor, Luu agreed to hire Atwood. Luu 
then gave Atwood money, totaling $95,930.00. There was 
sufficient evidence to indict Atwood for Theft in the First 
Degree. Yip, 92 Hawai' i at 105, 987 P.2d at 1003. 
Atwood argues that under section 5 of the definition of
 
deception in HRS § 708-800, he cannot be indicted for Theft in
 
the First Degree because he only failed to perform a contractual
 
obligation and there was no proof that he did not intend to
 
perform the contract when it was made. However, this argument
 
ignores sections 1 and 2 of the definition of deception which
 
prohibits creating or confirming an impression which is false. 
The fact that a contract may have been formed does not foreclose
 
criminal liability for other means of deception as specified by
 
HRS § 708-800. Any contract and subsequent performance under the
 
contract can be viewed as a furtherance of a continuous theft
 
offense; Atwood obtained more money from Luu by performing some
 
work and then requesting additional money. HRS § 708-801(6)
 
(amounts involved in thefts committed pursuant to one scheme or
 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
course of conduct may be aggregated in determining the class or 
grade of the offense); State v. Stenger, 122 Hawai' i 271, 289, 
226 P.3d 441, 459 (2010) (theft by deception may be a continuing offense) (citing State v. Martin, 62 Haw. 364, 616 P.2d 193 
(1980)). Therefore, evidence that Atwood did not intend to 
perform the contract at the time it was made is not required to 
indict Atwood for Theft in the First Degree under the theory 
asserted by the prosecution. 
Atwood's claim that HRS Chapters 436, 436B, and 444
 
prohibit prosecution of Theft in the First Degree, by deception,
 
is without merit. HRS Chapter 436 regarding Abstract Makers was
 
repealed in 1977 and is not relevant to this case. Atwood points
 
to HRS § 436B-26.5, which provides for imposition of a civil
 
fine, HRS § 444-22, which prohibits an unlicensed contractor from
 
recovering for work or material performed, and HRS § 444-23.5,
 
which allows for forfeiture of property used by an unlicensed
 
person, to argue that civil remedies for unlicensed contractor
 
work are adequate. However, provisions of HRS Chapters 436B and
 
444 specify that they are in addition to criminal actions. HRS 
§ 436B-26.5(j) (sanctions authorized are separate from and in
 
addition to other civil and criminal remedies as provided by
 
statute); HRS § 444-36 (regulated industries complaints office
 
shall report criminal violations of the chapter to the county
 
prosecutor's office or department of the attorney general).
 
Atwood also points out that under HRS § 436B-27(b), an
 
unlicensed contractor who engages in activity requiring a license
 
is guilty of a misdemeanor, as evidence that he cannot be
 
prosecuted for theft by deception. We reject this argument. In
 
State v. Brown, 108 Ohio App.3d 489, 671 N.E.2d 280 (1995), the
 
court held that prosecution for theft by deception was not barred
 
by a statute that prohibited a person from holding himself out as
 
an attorney that was not licensed to practice law. 108 Ohio
 
App.3d at 493, 671 N.E.2d at 282. The court in Brown reasoned
 
5 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the statute defining theft by deception had an additional
 
element of obtaining money by deception which was not present in
 
the statue barring false representation as an attorney. Id. at
 
493-94, 671 N.E.2d at 282-83. 
Similarly, Theft in the First Degree, by deception,
 
pursuant to HRS §§ 708-830.5 & 708-830(2), requires obtaining or
 exerting control over property of another by deception, something
 
that is not required to establish a violation of HRS Chapters
 
436B or 444. Therefore, Atwood may be indicted for Theft in the
 
First Degree, by deception.
 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court's December 16, 2009
 
Order Denying Dismissal is affirmed.
