NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(collectively, Defendants) and against Gapasin and Addway
 
(collectively, Plaintiffs) and dismissed with prejudice all
 
claims asserted in Plaintiffs' Complaint for Malicious
 
Prosecution and Wrongful Execution (the Complaint).
 
On appeal, Plaintiffs contend the circuit court
 
committed reversible error
 
(1) when the court dismissed the Complaint on the
 
ground that Plaintiffs failed to request attorneys' fees and
 
costs in the original action, Pascual, et al. v. Gapasin, et al.,
 
Civil No. 97-2600, (Original Action) because Addway was not a
 
party to the Original Action and could not have recovered
 
attorneys' fees in that action;
 
(2) by dismissing Plaintiffs' claim for Wrongful
 
Execution, which claim did not require Plaintiffs to have
 
requested fees and costs in the Original Action; and
 
(3) in converting Defendants' Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Complaint for 
Malicious Prosecution and Wrongful Execution (Motion to Dismiss) 
into an HRCP Rule 56(b) motion for summary judgment because 
Plaintiffs were never afforded any notice or opportunity to 
present factual evidence in opposition to summary judgment. 
Plaintiffs ask this court to vacate the circuit court's
 
"Order Granting (1) Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Complaint for
 
Malicious Prosecution and Wrongful Execution Filed on
 
September 22, 2008, Filed on November 3, 2009, and (2) Joinder in
 
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Complaint for Malicious Prosecution
 
and Wrongful Execution Filed on September 22, 2008 by Plaintiffs,
 
Which Motion was Filed by Defendants' Attorney on November 3,
 
2009 Filed on November 12, 2009" (Order) and to remand the case
 
for further proceedings on the Complaint.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
 
Plaintiffs' points of error as follows: 
(1) Plaintiffs' first point of error is without merit
 
because the record on appeal clearly indicates that the circuit
 
court did not grant the Motion to Dismiss based on the fact that
 
Plaintiffs failed to request attorneys' fees in the Original
 
Action. The circuit court granted the Motion to Dismiss because
 
(1) Gapasin was not the prevailing party in the Original Action
 
and therefore could not sustain his claim for Malicious
 
Prosecution and (2) Plaintiffs' Wrongful Execution claim was a
 
collateral attack on what had occurred in the Original Action.
 
(2) As discussed above, the circuit court dismissed
 
Plaintiffs' claim for Wrongful Execution because the claim was a
 
collateral attack on the Original Action. Therefore, Plaintiffs'
 
second point of error is without merit.
 
(3) On appeal, Plaintiffs argue that (a) aside from
 
the Order, there is no other indication in the record that it was
 the circuit court's intention to convert Defendants' HRCP
 
Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss into an HRCP Rule 56(b) motion
 
for summary judgment and (b) there is no indication in the record
 
that the circuit court considered any facts or assertions outside
 
the pleadings in this case, meaning that the Motion to Dismiss
 
could not be considered as a motion for summary judgment.
 
The circuit court explicitly informed the parties that
 
it had considered facts outside the pleadings and would therefore
 
convert Defendants' HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss into an
 
HRCP Rule 56(b) motion for summary judgment. On November 3,
 
2009, Defendants filed the Motion to Dismiss, to which Defendants
 
attached as exhibits the following documents from the Original
 
Action: the docket, the Second Writ of Execution, the Return [of
 
Service] on Serving Officer's Second Writ of Execution, and the
 
3

order granting Plaintiffs' motion to quash the Second Writ of 
Execution. The circuit court heard the Motion to Dismiss on 
December 12, 2009, affording Plaintiffs sufficient time to 
"object to the matters outside" of the pleadings that were 
presented by Defendants in their motion or to "seek a continuance 
pursuant to HRCP Rule 56(f) to obtain materials to oppose" the 
motion. Jou v. Nat'l Interstate Ins. Co. of Hawaii, 114 Hawai' i 
122, 131, 157 P.3d 561, 570 (App. 2007). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
 
January 15, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
