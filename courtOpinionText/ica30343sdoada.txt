(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant JS-L ("Mother") appeals from the

On appeal,  Mother asserts that the Family Court erred
in: (1) refusing to grant Plaintiff's Motion for Therapeutic
 Reunification, filed February 22, 2008 ("February 22, 2008 Motion
 for Therapeutic Reunification"); (2) denying Plaintiff's Rule

 In her opening brief, Mother addresses various orders not
identified in her Notice of Appeal. Defendant-Appellee IS ("Father") urges us
to disregard Mother's challenge to orders other than the January 12, 2010Order Denying February 25, 2008 Motion re Custody, Visitation, and Safeguards.Those orders, however, and the subsequent findings of fact ("FOF") andconclusions of law ("COL"), all relate directly to the order from which Motherappealed. Therefore, we will address Mother's arguments with regard to each
of the orders. See Haw. R. App. P. 4(a)(3); Ueoka v. Szymanski, 107 Hawai' i

 Custody, Visitation, and Safeguards"); (4) denying Plaintiff's
 Motion for Expert Assessment of Minor Child and for Leave to
 Conduct Investigation, filed February 25, 2008 ("February 25,

 Plaintiff's Motion for Disqualification of Family Court Judge,
 filed November 18, 2008 ("November 18, 2008 Motion for

 Dianne Gerard's Report, filed November 19, 2008, "and various
 related oral motions" ("November 19, 2008 Motion to Strike"); (7)
 denying Plaintiff's Motion for Relief from Order on "Material
 Change in Circumstances" and Motion to Apply H.R.S. § 571-46 as
 Amended by Act 114 (2008), filed February 13, 2009 ("February 13,
 2009 Motion for Relief from Order and to Apply HRS § 571-46");

 Motion re Custody, Visitation, and Safeguards; and (9) rendering
 various FOF and COL in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
 Law, filed April 8, 2010 ("April 8, 2010 FOF/COL").
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, having given due consideration to the
 arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, and
 utilizing the grouping of the related points of error structure
 adopted by Mother in her opening brief to facilitate analysis, we
 resolve Mother's points of error as follows:
3
 
A.	 Issues related to Dr. Gerard (Points of Error 1, 2, 6,
and 9)
 
Mother contends that the Family Court's refusal to
 
allow her to call Dr. Gerard as a witness, to subpoena Dr.
 
Gerard's records, and to take Dr. Gerard's deposition denied her
 
3
 Mother lists numerous FOF and COL that she claims to challenge
within each of the four points-of-error groupings. She makes no argument,
however, concerning the bulk of those challenged FOF or COL. Her challenge to
those unaddressed FOF and COL are therefore deemed waived. See Haw. R. App.
P. 28(b)(7).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the opportunity to contest Dr. Gerard's report ("Report") and to
 
submit evidence related to the case.4 Specifically, Mother
 
contends that the court "did not allow any discovery of evidence"
 concerning HS, "and then held it against [Mother] that she
 produced no evidence." 
Mother's claims with regard to Dr. Gerard ultimately
 
fail for two reasons. First, Mother fails to draw any connection
 between the Family Court's decision to not allow discovery of Dr.
 Gerard and her Report and the court's ruling on the motion for
 which the Report was prepared. The Report was prepared
 specifically to address three very limited issues related to the
 February 22, 2008 Motion for Therapeutic Reunification. See
 
supra note 4. Because neither party sought to re-schedule a
 hearing after receipt of the Report, the Family Court never ruled
 on the remainder of the motion. Therefore, Mother has
 established no connection between the Family Court's decision and
 any injury that Mother might have suffered.
 
Second, Mother is unable to demonstrate that the Report
 
had any bearing on any other ruling in the case. With regard to
 the order from which the appeal is taken, and which is the focus
 of Mother's argument, the Family Court explained that the
 March 4, 2005 Findings and Order After Hearing ("March 4, 2005
 Order") entered by the Superior Court of California, Marin
 County, was "the existing custody order in the case" and could
 not, therefore, be modified "unless there has been a material
 
4
 The issue of Dr. Gerard's Report arose in the context of the
agreed-upon resolution of Mother's February 22, 2008 Motion for Therapeutic
Reunification, which she sought to have heard on three days' notice. Father requested a continuance to allow him to file a memorandum in response. The parties discussed Mother's motion at the February 25, 2008 hearing andstipulated, instead, to have Dr. Gerard provide a report addressing (i)whether it would be in the parties' minor child's ("HS") best interest to moveMother's visitation from O' ahu to Kaua' i, (ii) whether it would be in HS's best
interest to commence "therapeutic reunification therapy/therapeuticvisitation" with Mother, and (iii) the impact on HS and Mother's relationshipif either (i) or (ii) were initiated. Based on "the discussion and oral agreement reached during the February 25, 2008 hearing," the June 10, 2008Order on Plaintiff's Motion for Therapeutic Reunification ordered that Dr.Gerard's preparation and distribution of the Report would not constitutewaiver of the psychologist-client privilege or serve as a basis for any partyto call Dr. Gerard as a witness, exercise any right to cross-examine her, orsubpoena any of her records pertaining to HS's treatment. In addition, theorder provided that after receipt of Dr. Gerard's Report, any party might re­schedule a hearing on the Motion for Therapeutic Reunification.

change in circumstances since the March 4, 2005 Order was entered
 
and a modification of the March 4, 2005 Order is [determined to
 be] in [HS's] best interest." Since the Report was not
 introduced into evidence during the trial, the Family Court found
 that there was no need for it to consider, and it did not
 consider, the Report.
5 Consequently, Mother's due process right
 
to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner
 before governmental deprivation of a significant liberty interest
 was not implicated in this case by the Family Court's rulings
 concerning Dr. Gerard and her Report.
 
As to those FOF that relate to Mother's failure to
 
introduce evidence, Mother does not explain what information she
 might have found if she had been permitted to examine or conduct
 discovery of Dr. Gerard. Nor does she describe why she believes
 that Dr. Gerard had knowledge of the information that she sought
 or why she could not introduce such information through the
 examination or discovery of other witnesses. 
Therefore, the Family Court did not abuse its
 
discretion in refusing to grant the February 22, 2008 Motion for
 Therapeutic Reunification; denying the June 13, 2008 Motion to
 Reconsider; denying the November 19, 2008 Motion to Strike; or in
 rendering FOF 22–25, 30, 78, 81, 83, 89, 92, 94, 100–01, 104–06,

B.	 The recusal/disqualification issue (Points of Error 5
and 9)
 
"Decisions on recusal or disqualification present
 
5
 Mother challenges the Family Court's finding that the Report was
not considered, asserting that the court elsewhere found that Dr. Gerard was
"capable of protecting [HS]'s well-being at th[at] time." Rather than
 reflecting a "sweeping endorsement of Dr. Gerard's participation in the case,"
however, the Family Court's reference to Dr. Gerard (which the court said
related as well to HS's counsel, David Donner) related narrowly to Mother's
request for an assessment of HS and the court's conclusion that an assessment
was unnecessary at the time. That the Family Court found that HS's interests
were sufficiently represented by her lawyer and her therapist so as to make a
further assessment unnecessary does not demonstrate that it was clearly
erroneous for the court to find that it had not considered Dr. Gerard's Report
in resolving the February 25, 2008 Motion re Custody, Visitation, and
Safeguards. Neither has Mother identified any facts to support her conclusion
that the Report had "poisoned the well against [Mother] for all purposes
. . . ."

perhaps the ultimate test of judicial discretion and should thus 
lie undisturbed absent a showing of abuse of that discretion." State v. Ross, 89 Hawai' i 371, 375, 974 P.2d 11, 15 (1998). 
"[M]ere erroneous or adverse rulings by the trial judge do not spell bias or prejudice and cannot be made the basis for disqualification." Peters v. Jamieson, 48 Hawai' i 247, 264, 397 
P.2d 575, 586 (1964). As Mother presents nothing more than alleged erroneous or adverse rulings as the basis for her November 18, 2008 Motion for Disqualification, the Family Court did not err in denying the motion or in rendering FOF 142 or COL 28, 29, 33–35, 39–41, 43, or 44 in the April 8, 2010 FOF/COL. See Chen v. Hoeflinger, 127 Hawai' i 346, 362, 279 P.3d 11, 27 
(App. 2012) (judicial bias cannot be based solely on prior adverse rulings in the same case). 
C.	 Change of circumstance issues (Points of Error 3, 7, 8
and 9)
 
1.	 Finality of the California Orders
 
Hawai'i appellate courts have long held that a party 
seeking to modify a final custody order must first show that a 
material change in circumstances has occurred since the final custody order was entered. See Nadeau v. Nadeau, 10 Haw. App. 
111, 121, 861 P.2d 754, 759 (1993) (explaining that a parent requesting a change in custody must show a change in circumstances since the entry of the prior custody order); see also Turoff v. Turoff, 56 Haw. 51, 55–56, 527 P.2d 1275, 1278 (1974) (determining that, where a parent requests a change in custody, the "question is whether substantial change has occurred since the initial Decision and Order requiring modification or change in the award of custody of the minor child"); cf. In re Guardianship of Doe, 93 Hawai' i 374, 388, 4 P.3d 508, 522 (App. 
2000) ("A person seeking a change in visitation must show a material change in circumstances since the previous visitation order.")
6 California courts recognize a similar requirement. In 
6
 Mother observes that the Hawai' i Supreme Court avoided holding
that a change of circumstances must be established to modify custody in Doe v. 
Doe, 98 Hawai' i 144, 153, 44 P.3d 1085, 1094 (2002), and has never embraced
"this 'changed circumstances' rule" since enactment of HRS § 571-46. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
re Marriage of Burgess, 913 P.2d 473, 481-82 (Cal. 1996)
 
("Ordinarily, after a judicial custody determination, the
 noncustodial parent seeking to alter the order for legal and
 physical custody can do so only on a showing that there has been
 a substantial change of circumstances so affecting the minor
 child that modification is essential to the child's welfare.") 
Mother argues, however, that the Family Court erred by
 
ruling that the November 22, 1999 Stipulation and Order Re:
 Modification ("November 22, 1999 Stipulated Order") and the
 March 4, 2005 Order issued by the Superior Court of California
 for the County of Marin (collectively, the "California Orders")
 were final orders requiring that Mother show a material change of
 circumstances to modify custody. 
Although Mother rests her argument on the basis of 
California case law and its differentiated treatment of certain non-final stipulated and otherwise permanent custody orders,
7 
Hawai'i recognizes a similar distinction between temporary and 
permanent custody orders and the effect that each has on the changed circumstances requirement. Aoki v. Aoki, 105 Hawai' i 
403, 411, 98 P.3d 274, 282 (App. 2004) ("With respect to the legal and physical custody of children, temporary decisions involve different considerations than permanent decisions.") In Hawai'i, however, temporary custody orders are issued pre-decree, 
while permanent custody orders are issued as part of the decree itself or follow thereafter. Aoki, for instance, involved a 
proposed modification of a pre-decree custody order, which 
Therefore, she urges us to "reconsider and overrule the language in Nadeau v. 
Nadeau . . . and In re Guardianship of Doe . . . requiring proof of a change
of circumstances." The supreme court noted in Doe v. Doe that Nadeau and In 
re Guardianship of Doe were inapposite "because the parties were requesting a
modification in custody and were not challenging the original custodydetermination in the context of a post-hearing motion, as was Mother." 98 Hawai'i at 153, 44 P.3d at 1094. To the contrary, this case involves a
modification of custody, similar to that sought in Nadeau and In re 
Guardianship of Doe. In addition, and unlike the case in Doe v. Doe, theFamily Court in this case afforded Mother an evidentiary hearing at which topresent her case for modification. Therefore, we decline to reconsider oroverrule those cases. 
7
 In California, the changed-circumstances test does not apply when
custody was the product of a parties' stipulation and the order did not
reflect a clear, affirmative indication that the parties intended that the
result be viewed as final. Montenegro v. Diaz, 27 P.3d 289, 295 (Cal. 2001). 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
expressly awarded "temporary joint legal custody" and "temporary
 
physical custody." Id. As such, "a material change in
 
circumstances was not a prerequisite to a different 'permanent'
 award." Id.
 
In the instant case, Mother and Father were married on
 
February 11, 1996, and were divorced on December 6, 1996. The
 November 22, 1999 Stipulated Order, albeit issued pursuant to
 stipulation of the parties, was issued post-decree and made no
 reference to "temporary" custody or any hearings to follow.
 Mother's counsel subsequently explained that Mother entered into
 the November 22, 1999 Stipulated Order because "[w]hen the
 opportunity arose to accept a joint custody settlement rather
 than risk losing [HS] altogether at a trial, [Mother] opted to do
 what she felt was the safest bet for [HS] at the time, given the
 circumstances." 
The March 4, 2005 Order is even more clear in that it 
is both post-decree and bears no indication that it resulted from a stipulation. Indeed, the order includes the words "After Hearing" in its title. Nothing in the order or its attachments suggest that it was anything but a final order to which the changed circumstances rule would then attach. See In re 
Guardianship of Doe, 93 Hawai' i at 388, 4 P.3d at 522 (pre-trial 
visitation order reinstated post-trial was the "previous visitation order" from which Mother was required to show a material change in circumstances). 
In sum, Mother presents no basis upon which we might
 
conclude that the Family Court erred in holding that the post-
decree California Orders were final orders requiring that Mother
 show a material change of circumstances to modify custody.
 
2. 	HRS § 571-46, best interest of the child, and
changed circumstances
 
Mother contends that the 2008 amendments to HRS § 571­
46 relieved parents of any obligation to establish changed
 
circumstances and that a plain reading of the amended statute
 only requires the court to determine the best interest of the
 child. We agree that the court must determine the best interest
 of the child, but we are not persuaded that the 2008 amendments
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
require us to abolish the application of the change of
 
circumstances rule to the modification of post-decree child
 custody orders.
8
 
Analytically, in any event, we discern little of actual
 
significance in requiring a demonstration of changed
 circumstances as part of the post-decree best interest of the
 child analysis. See Marriage of Burgess, 913 P.2d at 482. "The
 
changed-circumstance rule is not a different test, devised to
 supplant the statutory test, but an adjunct to the best-interest
 test." Burchard v. Garay, 724 P.2d 486, 488 (Cal. 1986). If a
 
custody arrangement was previously determined to be in the
 child's best interest, whether the consequence of a stipulation
 or an evidentiary hearing, then, logically, some change in
 circumstances must have occurred for the court to conclude that
 an alternative arrangement is now in the child's best interest. 
Moreover, requiring such a determination as a threshold matter
 promotes judicial economy. See id. ("The rule thus fosters the
 
dual goals of judicial economy and protecting stable custody
 arrangements.") 
Explicitly requiring that changed circumstances be
 
identified as a threshold issue in the best interest of the child
 analysis merely incorporates the law of the case principle that
 the parties may not relitigate issues that have previously been
 determined between them in the same case. See Wong v. City and
 
Cnty. of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 395, 665 P.2d 157, 162 (1983). 
Since an existing post-decree custody order issued after a
 hearing already reflects the court's determination of the child's
 best interest, the non-custodial parent will not be able to
 establish that the child's best interest requires a change in
 custody if she cannot establish that the context in which the
 motion arises is materially different from the context as of the
 time of the prior decision. 
Accordingly, the Family Court did not err in requiring
 
8
 By far, the most significant aspect of these amendments enumerated
a multitude of factors to be considered in determining the best interest of
the child. See 2008 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 114, § 2 at 304-07. Such additional
 
refinement, while perhaps providing some indicia of what might constitute a
material change in circumstances, in no way suggests that the change of
circumstances rule should now be invalidated.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
that Mother demonstrate changed circumstances before it would
 
proceed to the remainder of its best-interest-of-the-child
 analysis.
 
3. Material change in circumstances
 
Mother contends that the court erred in issuing FOF 44­
127, and COL 7 because she "undoubtedly established a material
 change of circumstances" and asserts sixteen facts which she
 alleges amount to a material change of circumstances to support
 that contention. The Family Court's April 8, 2010 FOF explicitly
 addressed a majority of the sixteen asserted facts and found that
 Mother failed to show that a material change in circumstances had
 occurred since the entry of the March 4, 2005 Order.
 
Based on our careful review of the record of these
 
proceedings, we conclude that the Family Court's findings of fact
 are grounded in substantial evidence and, therefore, are not
 clearly erroneous.
 
The only relevant alleged facts listed by Mother that
 
the court did not explicitly address are those numbered 5 and 6,
 which allege that "[t]here is a California court order
 prohibiting [IS's father] from being in [IS's girlfriend's
 daughter's] presence"; and "[t]hat order is ignored by [IS and
 his father]."
9 Mother, however, failed to introduce the alleged
 
order into the record or to establish any connection between the
 allegations (which related to HS's grandfather and IS's
 girlfriend's daughter) and HS; thus, there was no evidence before
 the Family Court to establish whether the alleged order
 constituted a material change in circumstances. It was not
 clearly erroneous for the Family Court to conclude that Mother
 had failed to show that a material change in circumstances had
 occurred since the entry of the March 4, 2005 Order, and,
 therefore, the court did not err in denying Mother's February 25,
 2008 Motion re Custody, Visitation, and Safeguards.
 
9
 We decline to pass on the Family Court's evaluation of IS's
girlfriend's testimony. "It is well-settled that an appellate court will not
pass upon issues dependent upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of
the evidence; this is the province of the trier of fact." In re Doe, 95
Hawai'i 183, 190, 20 P.3d 616, 623 (2001) (ellipsis, brackets, internal
quotation marks, and citations omitted). 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Findings of fact by the Family Court are presumptively 
correct and the party seeking to overturn them has the burden of 
pointing out specifically wherein the findings are clearly erroneous. Rogers v. Pedro, 3 Haw. App. 136, 139, 642 P.2d 549, 
552 (1982). Aside from restating her alleged change in circumstances, Mother has failed to provide the court with any arguments or evidence that would negate any of the Family Court's FOFs or COLs. Accordingly, the Family Court's FOFs are not clearly erroneous. Furthermore, the Family Court's COLs are not wrong, but rather are supported by the Family Court's FOFs and reflect an application of the correct rule of law. Chun v. Bd. 
of Trs. of Emps.' Ret. Sys. of the State of Haw., 106 Hawai' i 
416, 430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005). 
Therefore, the Family Court did not err in the terms of
 
its order regarding the February 25, 2008 Motion re Custody,
 Visitation, and Safeguards; in denying the February 13, 2009
 Motion for Relief from Order and to Apply HRS § 571-46; in its
 January 12, 2010 Order Denying February 25, 2008 Motion re
 Custody, Visitation, and Safeguards; or in rendering FOF 9, 14,
 15, 45–47, 53, 54, 63, 65, 67–73, 78, 81, 83, 87, 89, 92, 94,
 100, 101, 104–06, 109, 111, 113, 116, 117, 120, 121, 127, 129,
 134, 135, 137, 138–40, or 142, or COL, 2–9, 11–14, 16, 17, 19,
 20, 23–25, 28, 29, 33–35, 39–41, 43, or 44 in the April 8, 2010
 FOF/COL. 
D.	 The Evaluation/Investigation Issue (Points of Error 4
and 9)
 
Mother's final argument on appeal is that the Family
 
Court erred in denying her February 25, 2008 Motion for Expert
 
Assessment/Investigation. Mother argues that "[g]iven all that
 [HS] has experienced and the deterioration in her relationship
 with her mother, it is axiomatic that good cause existed for such
 an evaluation." Mother does not identify any experience to which
 she refers, but presumably it includes Mother's abduction and
 concealment of HS for more than three years, which Mother
 explained was the consequence of her belief that HS was being
 abused by her Father. 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
While any parent's firmly held belief that someone was 
and may still be abusing his or her child and that his or her 
relationship with that child is deteriorating is of grave significance to the affected parent, it is not therefore "axiomatic" that another assessment or evaluation of the child is necessary. Mother's single-paragraph argument on appeal does not make the case that the Family Court disregarded rules or principles of law or practice or that its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of reason. See Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai' i 
41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006). 
To the contrary, the Family Court's decision was well-
grounded. The July 8, 2008 Order Denying Plaintiff's
 February 25, 2008 Motion for Expert Assessment of Minor Child and
 for Leave to Conduct Investigation reflects that the court
 considered a variety of sources, including (i) Minor's Opposition
 to Plaintiff's Request That She Undergo a Psychological
 Evaluation and Appointment of Robert Geffner as a Neutral
 Evaluator, filed on April 7, 2008, and (ii) Minor's Counsel's
 Joinder in Defendant's Memorandum in Response to Plaintiff's
 Reply to Defendant's Opposition to Motion for an Assessment of
 the Child, and Re What Issues are yet to be Determined on Their
 Merits, Including Custody, Visitation, Exposure to Domestic
 Violence, Suspected Child Sexual Abuse and Neglect, etc., filed
 on June 5, 2008, in concluding that it was "not in the best
 interest of [HS] to be subjected to further assessments,
 evaluations, and/or forensic interviews."
 
Mother summarily argues on appeal that "Dr. Geffner's
 
credentials are impeccable, and the critical questions left
 unanswered in this case are very germane to [HS's] welfare."
 Standing alone, the credentials of Mother's proffered expert have
 nothing to do with the best interest of HS, nor do they have any
 effect on a finding of good cause. Nowhere does Mother explain
 what "critical questions" remain in this case or why good cause
 exists to further assess HS. Thus, Mother fails to provide a
 sufficient basis for us to find error.
 
Therefore, the Family Court did not err in denying the
 
February 25, 2008 Motion for Expert Assessment/Investigation or
