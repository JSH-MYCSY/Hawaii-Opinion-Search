APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0081)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over this appeal that Defendant-Appellant 
Association of Apartment Owners of Sands of Kahana (Appellant AOAO Sands of Kahana) has asserted from the Honorable Joel E. August's January 13, 2010 "Order Granting Plaintiff William T. Vinson's Motion for Summary Judgment Filed on November 4, 2009, and Denying Defendant Association of Apartment Owners of Sands of Kahana's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Complaint Filed on February 3, 2009, Filed on November 13, 2009" (the January 13, 2010 summary judgment order) because the circuit court has not reduced the January 13, 2010 summary judgment order to a separate judgment that resolves all claims against all parties in this case pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2009) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). The supreme court has promulgated HRCP Rule 58, which specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." (Emphases added.) The supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994) The separate judgment must "either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An 
appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 
(footnote omitted). Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 
Hawai
'i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation omitted; 
emphasis added). For example, the supreme court has explained that, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) [(regarding dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set forth on a separate document.'"

The January 13, 2010 summary judgment order is not a
 
judgment, but, instead, it is an interlocutory order. On
 
April 12, 2010, the appellate court clerk filed the record on
 appeal for Appeal No. 30345, at which time the record on appeal
 did not contain a separate judgment that resolves all claims in
 this case. Absent a separate, appealable judgment, Appellant
 AOAO Sands of Kahana's appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. 30345 is dismissed
 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
