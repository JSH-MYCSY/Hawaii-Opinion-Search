IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
PAUL ROGER MARINAS PATRON, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 2P108-1210)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Paul Roger Marinas Patron
 
("Patron") appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or
 
Order ("Judgment"), filed on December 16, 2009, in the District
 Court of the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division ("District
 Court").
1 After a bench trial, the District Court convicted
 
Patron of Assault in the Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii
 
2
Revised Statutes ยง 707-712(1)(a) (1993),  and sentenced him to
thirty days in jail.
 
On appeal, Patron argues that (1) the District Court 
plainly erred in allowing the case to proceed to trial, where his counsel was unprepared; and (2) he was denied effective assistance of counsel, where his counsel (a) failed to obtain discovery until the morning of trial and move for a trial continuance, and (b) failed to move to dismiss the charge after more than 180 days had elapsed from the date of the incident to the date of trial, in violation of Hawai
'i Rules of Penal

 HRS ยง 707-712(1)(a) provides: "A person commits the offense of
assault in the third degree if the person . . . [i]ntentionally, knowingly, or
recklessly causes bodily injury to another person[.]"

Procedure ("HRPP") Rule 48.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Patron's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The District Court did not plainly err by failing
 
to continue trial sua sponte. After conferring with counsel for
 both parties, the District Court determined that it would proceed
 to trial on the instant matter, stating that it was the court's
 "understanding . . . that the parties are prepared to proceed
 today on . . . the assault case[.]"
3 Defense counsel did not
 
indicate that she was unprepared for trial. Cf. State v. Torres,
 
54 Haw. 502, 502-07, 510 P.2d 494, 495-98 (1973) ("[T]here is no
 per se rule regarding constitutionally adequate time in which
 . . . counsel may prepare."). 
(2) Patron's assistance of counsel was not ineffective.
 (a) Patron does not meet his burden of showing that his 
counsel's assistance was ineffective. Despite asserting that counsel failed to review the file until the morning of trial or obtain discovery, Patron does not demonstrate that "such errors or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense." State v. 
Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998) (quoting 
State v. Fukusaku, 85 Hawai' i 462, 480, 946 P.2d 32, 50 (1997)). 
(b) Patron's argument that his counsel's incomplete
 
preparation caused her to neglect to move to dismiss under HRPP
 Rule 48 is unavailing. Had counsel done so, the District Court
 would have properly concluded that, excluding various periods of
 time pursuant to HRPP Rule 48(c) and (d), no more than 180 days
 elapsed from the time he was arrested to the time of trial. Haw.
 R. Pen. Proc. 48; see State v. Coyaso, 73 Haw. 352, 356, 833 P.2d
 66, 68 (1992) (stating that "the prosecutor, the court and the
 accused share responsibility for carrying out the speedy-trial
 requirements of Rule 48" (quoting State v. English, 68 Haw. 46,
 53, 705 P.2d 12, 17 (1985)). Therefore, Patron was not deprived

 The District Court continued trial on an additional charge against
Patron.

of a potentially meritorious defense.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the December 16, 2009 Notice
 
of Entry of Judgment and/or Order filed in the District Court of
 the Second Circuit, Wailuku Division, is affirmed.
