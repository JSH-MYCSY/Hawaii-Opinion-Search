IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
GRICOR NAZARIAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-1277)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Gricor Nazarian (Gricor) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence filed on
 
January 21, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(circuit court).1
 
On appeal, Gricor contends the circuit court erred by
 
denying his Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea because he (1) "did
 
not knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily waive his rights in
 
pleading guilty" and (2) "presented a fair and just reason for
 
his request to withdraw his plea."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as

well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Gricor's appeal is without merit.
 
To withdraw a plea before sentencing, Gricor must first 
present a fair and just reason for withdrawal and second must 
show that the "State has not relied upon the plea to its 
substantial prejudice." State v. Gomes, 79 Hawai 'i 32, 36, 897 
P.2d 959, 963 (1995) (quoting State v. Adams, 76 Hawai 'i 408, 
411, 879 P.2d 513, 516 (1994)). If Gricor "cannot carry the 
threshold burden of showing a 'fair and just reason' for 
withdrawing the plea, the following issue of the State's 
detrimental reliance upon the plea is of no consequence." State 
v. Topasna, 94 Hawai 'i 444, 451, 16 P.3d 849, 856 (App. 2000). 
"The two fundamental bases for showing a 'fair and just reason' 
for withdrawing a guilty plea are (1) that the defendant did not 
knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive the rights 
relinquished upon pleading guilty, or (2) that changed 
circumstances or new information justify withdrawal of the plea." 
Id. at 452, 16 P.3d at 857. 
Because "[a] trial judge is constitutionally required 
to ensure that a guilty plea is voluntarily and knowingly 
entered[,] . . . the court should make an affirmative showing by 
an on-the-record colloquy between the court and the defendant 
wherein the defendant is shown to have a full understanding of 
what the plea of guilty connotes and its consequences." State v. 
Solomon, 107 Hawai 'i 117, 126, 111 P.3d 12, 21 (2005) (quoting 
State v. Williams, 68 Haw. 498, 499, 702 P.2d 1010, 1012 (1986)). 
"Additionally, when a trial court accepts a guilty 
plea, [Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP)] Rule 11 requires 
the court to first address the defendant personally in open court and then determine that the plea is voluntary." Solomon, 107 
Hawai
'i at 127, 111 P.3d at 22.

On May 4, 2009, the circuit court addressed Gricor in
 
open court:
 
THE COURT: Okay. Your attorney has handed me a two-
page written guilty plea form with a two-page letter about a
proposed plea agreement from Mr. Cook [State's attorney] to
Mr. Burke [Gricor's attorney] about your case. That's
 attached. On page 2 of the guilty plea form, about halfway
down, there is a signature. Is that your signature?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: 
Yes, sir.
 
THE COURT: All right. And did you sign this after
going over the whole thing with Mr. Burke?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: Yes, sir. 
THE COURT: You understand you're in court today
pleading guilty to one count of Theft in the First Degree?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: Yes, sir.
 THE COURT: You understand that is a class B felony so
you face a maximum possible punishment of 10 years in prison
and up to a 25,000-dollar fine?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: Yes, sir.
 
THE COURT: Do you understand what that charge is all
about, what you're being charged with?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: Yes, sir.
 
THE COURT: And do you understand that anytime
somebody pleads guilty, it means they're choosing to do that
and are giving up the right to have a trial in this matter.
If there were a trial, the prosecutor, Mr. Cook, would bring
in witnesses and other evidence and try to prove this charge
against you beyond a reasonable doubt. Your attorney,
Mr. Burke, would be able to ask questions or cross-examine
all the State's witnesses, challenge all of their evidence.
You could bring witnesses on your behalf. You could testify
if you wanted to. If it was a trial in front of a jury and
you decided you didn't want to testify, I would tell the
jurors they couldn't hold your silence against you when they
decided the case.
[2]
 You'd also be able to help your lawyer
pick or select the jury. But anytime somebody pleads
guilty, it means they're choosing to do that and are giving
up the right to have a trial, confront witnesses, and the
like. Do you understand all of that?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: 
Yes, sir.

 Although the circuit court did not explicitly inform Gricor that he
was waiving his privilege against self-incrimination, the circuit court did
inform Gricor that if he went to trial, he would not have to testify if he did
not want to, which is effectively his privilege against self-incrimination.

THE COURT: All right. Now, is anyone or anything
forcing you or pressuring you to plead guilty?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: No.
 
THE COURT: Okay. I also have to tell you, whether it
applies to you or not because I have to tell everybody the
same thing, if you're not a United States citizen, pleading
guilty can have immigration consequences, including the
possibilities of deportation, denial of naturalization as a
United States citizen, and denial of future admission into
the United States. Do you understand all that?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: Yes. 
* * *
 
[THE COURT:] Apart from what I have just said to you,
has anybody promised you or assured you of anything?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: No. 
. . . .
 
[THE COURT:] Apart from what I have just told you,
has anybody promised you or assured you of anything
regarding how this case is going to be handled,
Mr. Nazarian? 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: No. 
THE COURT: Okay. All right, you've had a chance to
discuss this whole thing with your attorney, Mr. Burke?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: (Nods head)
 THE COURT: And are you satisfied with his advice and
representations?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: Yeah.
 THE COURT: Okay, Mr. Nazarian, as to the single count
of Theft in the First Degree, what is your plea to that
charge?
 
DEFENDANT GRICOR NAZARIAN: Guilty.
 
The above colloquy demonstrates that the circuit court
 
complied with HRPP Rule 11 and that Gricor's plea and waiver of
 
rights was done knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. 
The record indicates that although Gricor was torn
 
between accepting the plea agreement or allowing his wife to face
 
possible negative immigration consequences, Gricor nonetheless
 
entered his plea voluntarily. The record does not indicate that
 
the circuit court "clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or
 
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the

substantial detriment of a party litigant." State v. Crisostomo, 
94 Hawai 'i 282, 287, 12 P.3d 873, 878 (2000) (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Probation Sentence filed on January 21, 2010 in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.

'i, March 7, 2011.
