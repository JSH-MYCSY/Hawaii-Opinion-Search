STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
NOLAN L.K. CRABBE, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-1175)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth, and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Nolan L.K. Crabbe (Crabbe) appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on January 27,
 
1
2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court). 
A jury convicted Crabbe of Robbery in the Second Degree, in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 708-841(1)(a) (Supp.
 
2010). 
On appeal, Crabbe contends the circuit court erred (1)
 
in failing to instruct the jury on the included offense of Theft

in the Fourth Degree and this court should reverse State v. 
Haanio, 94 Hawai' i 405, 16 P.3d 246 (2001), which holds that 
failure to give such an instruction would be harmless in this case; (2) by denying his request to continue the trial to allow 
him to interview a prosecution witness; and (3) by denying his 
motion for a new trial, which was based on the court's failure to 
continue the trial. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Crabbe's appeal is without merit.
 
Assuming arguendo the circuit court erred in failing to 
instruct the jury on the included offense of Theft in the Fourth 
Degree, such error was harmless because the jury convicted Crabbe 
of the charged offense of Robbery in the Second Degree. Haanio, 
94 Hawai' i at 415-16, 16 P.3d at 256-57. We must decline 
Crabbe's request to overturn this Hawai' i Supreme Court decision. 
The circuit court did not err (1) in refusing to 
continue the trial because Crabbe said he needed more time to 
interview a prosecution witness and (2) by denying Crabbe's 
motion for a new trial. State v. Lee, 9 Haw. App. 600, 603-04, 
856 P.2d 1279, 1281-82 (1993); State v. Yamada, 108 Hawai' i 474, 
478, 122 P.3d 254, 258 (2005). Crabbe made no attempt to contact 
the prosecution witness prior to trial, refused the circuit 
court's offer of a recess to allow defense counsel to speak with 
the witness, was able to cross-examine the witness at trial, and 
fails to show how interviewing the witness prior to trial would 
have aided his defense. Assuming arguendo there was error, it 
was harmless. 
Therefore,
