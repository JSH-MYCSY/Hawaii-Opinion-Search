STATE OF HAWAI I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BRADLEY D.M. PAI, Defendant-Appellant»
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(CR. NO. 09-1-0381K)
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
AND DENYING MOTION TO REFUND FILING FEE
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellant Bradley S.M.
Pai's (Appellant Pai) May 6, 2010 (a) motion to dismiss this
appeal and (b) motion to refund the filing fee that Appellant Pai
paid for this appeal, and (2) the record, it appears Hawaii
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11 (Supp. 2009) does not authorize
us to assume appellate jurisdiction over Appellant Pai's appeal
from the Honorable Elizabeth A. Strance's February 8, 2010 "Order
Regarding Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint" (the
February 8, 2010 order) because the circuit court did not enter a
judgment of conviction with a sentence against Appellant Pai.
"Any party deeming oneself aggrieved by the judgment of
a circuit court in a criminal matter, may appeal to the
intermediate appellate court, subject to chapter 602 in the
manner and within the time provided by the rules of the court." 
HRS § 641-11.  "The sentence of the court in a criminal case
shall be the judgment."  Id.  The circuit court has not entered
any sentence against Appellant Pai, and, thus, HRS § 641-11 does
not authorize Appellant Pai's appeal at this time.  State v.
Johnston, 63 Haw. 9, 11, 619 P.2d 1076, 1077 (1980).  Absent anNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI »I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-appealable judgment, we lack jurisdiction over Appellant Pai's
appeal.  
By asserting the instant appeal, Appellant Pai has
forced the intermediate court of appeals to utilize its resources
to process Appellant Pai's appeal.  Therefore, Appellant Pai's
request for a refund of his filing fee lacks merit.  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Pai's May 6, 2010
motion to dismiss this appeal is granted, and we dismiss the
appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Pai's 
May 6, 2010 motion to refund his filing fees for this appeal is
denied.
