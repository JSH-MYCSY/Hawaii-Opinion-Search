IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
BRIAN L. SAKAMAKI and DONNA J. WALDEN,
Trustee of the Donna J. Walden Revocable Living Trust
dated September 14, 1988, Plaintiffs-Appellees, 
v.
 
GLACS LLC, a Hawaii Limited Liability Company, et al.,
Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-1601)
 
ORDER GRANTING MARCH 23, 2010 MOTION TO
DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION AND DENYING
 
MARCH 23, 2010 MOTION FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/ 
Appellees Brian L. Sakamaki (Appellee Sakamaki) and Donna J. 
Walden's (Appellee Walden) March 23, 2010 motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction and motion for an award of attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Rule 38 of the Hawai
'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), (2) Defendants/Counterclaim-Plaintiffs/Appellants GLACS, LLC (Appellant GLACS), and Kokua Home Care, LLC's (Appellant Kokua Home Care), March 31, 2010 memorandum in opposition to Appellees Sakamaki and Walden's March 23, 2010 motions and (3) the record, it appear that we lack jurisdiction over Appellants GLACS and Kokua Home Care's appeal from the Honorable Gary W.B. Chang's February 4, 2010 "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment" and "Order Regarding Defendants GLACS and Kokua Home Care LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment on Complaint for Declaratory Relief" (the two February 4, 2010 interlocutory orders), because the circuit court has not reduced the two February 4, 2010 interlocutory orders to a separate judgment that resolves all claims in this case pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2009) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals 
from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). The supreme court has promulgated HRCP Rule 58, which specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." HRCP Rule 58 (emphasis added). Based on this requirement, the supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d at 1334, 1338 (1994). 
The separate judgment must "either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An appeal from an order that is not 
reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. 
at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848), doctrine (the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b), the two February 4, 2010 interlocutory orders do not satisfy the requirements for appealability under these exceptions. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 
Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two 
requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 
P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641­1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). We note, in particular, that the two February 4, 2010 interlocutory orders resolve issues that relate directly to the merits of the parties' substantive claims, and, thus, the two February 4, 2010 interlocutory orders are not appealable under the collateral order doctrine. Consequently, absent a separate judgment, Appellants GLACS and Kokua Home Care's appeal from the two February 4, 2010 interlocutory orders

appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction.
 
Although we lack jurisdiction over this appeal, we
 
decline Appellees Sakamaki and Walden's request for an award of
 
attorney's fees and costs pursuant to HRAP Rule 38. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees Sakamaki and
 
Walden's March 23, 2010 motion to dismiss appellate court case
 number 30357 for lack of jurisdiction is granted, and this appeal
 is dismissed.
 
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees Sakamaki
 
and Walden's March 23, 2010 motion for an award of attorney's
 fees and costs pursuant to HRAP Rule 38 is denied.
