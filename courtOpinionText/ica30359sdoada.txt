IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
JACQUELINE RIGSBY, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
WILLIAM E. RIGSBY, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 61854)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Jacqueline Rigsby ("Jacqueline")
 
appeals from (i) the January 4, 2010 Order Denying Plaintiff's
 
Motion for Post Decree Relief ("January 4, 2010 Order Denying
 Plaintiff's Motion"), (ii) the January 4, 2010 Order Denying
 Request for Reconsideration Filed December 22, 2009 ("January 4,
 2010 Order Denying Reconsideration"), and (iii) the February 16,
 2010 Order Denying Plaintiff's Second Request for Reconsideration
 Filed January 22, 2010 ("February 16, 2010 Order Denying Second
 Request for Reconsideration"), filed in the Family Court of the
 First Circuit ("Family Court").

The January 4, 2010 Order Denying Plaintiff's Motion
 
denied Jacqueline's September 3, 2009 Motion and Affidavit for
 Post-Decree Relief ("September 3, 2009 Post-Decree Motion"),
 under which Jacqueline sought an increase in alimony, and granted
 Defendant-Appellee William E. Rigsby's ("William") oral motion to
 terminate William's spousal support obligation. The January 4,
 2010 Order Denying Reconsideration denied Jacqueline's
 December 22, 2009 Request for Reconsideration under which
 Jacqueline sought reconsideration of the Family Court's oral
 announcement that the court would deny Jacqueline's September 3,
 2009 Post-Decree Motion and grant William's oral motion to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
terminate spousal support. The February 16, 2010 Order Denying
 
Second Motion for Reconsideration denied Jacqueline's January 22,
 2010 Second Request for Reconsideration under which Jacqueline
 sought reconsideration of the January 4, 2010 Order Denying
 Plaintiff's Motion.
 
On appeal, Jacqueline asserts multiple points of error,
 
which can be summarized as follows: the Family Court erred by
 denying her request for alimony modification while granting
 William's motion to terminate his alimony obligation because to
 do so was unfair and inconsistent with the court's prior rulings
 in the case; William has a history of failing to comply with
 court-ordered child support and alimony obligations; the Family
 Court's articulated reason for denying Jacqueline's request for
 alimony modification and instead granting William's motion to
 terminate alimony was not supported by substantial evidence; the
 costs incurred by William in his defense against Jacqueline's
 claims were unnecessary; and William did not support his claim
 for a material change in financial circumstances.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Jacqueline's points of error as follows:
 
I. Jurisdiction
 
In our August 25, 2010 Order Denying Defendant Appellee
 
William E. Rigsby's August 2, 2010 Motion to Dismiss Appeal 
("August 25, 2010 Order"), we concluded that Jacqueline's
 March 2, 2010 notice of appeal was timely filed as to the
 February 16, 2010 Order Denying Second Request for
 Reconsideration, Haw. R. App. P. 4(a), and that, therefore, we
 held only limited jurisdiction over this appeal. Order Den.
 Def.-Appellee William E. Rigsby's Aug. 2, 2010 Mot. Dismiss
 Appeal, at 2-3 (Haw. Ct. App. Aug. 25, 2010).
 
Accordingly, as we held in our August 25, 2010 Order,
 
"pursuant to HRS § 571-54, we have jurisdiction over
 [Jacqueline's] appeal . . . to the limited extent that she seeks
 appellate review of the [February 16, 2010 Order Denying Second

    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Request for Reconsideration]" as though the January 22, 2010
 
Second Request for Reconsideration was brought under HFCR Rule
 60(b). Id. (emphasis added).
 
II. HFCR Rule 60(b) Analysis
 
The appeal of a denial of an HFCR Rule 60(b) motion
 
brings up for review only whether the trial court abused its
 discretion in denying the motion itself; it does not bring up for
 review the merits of the underlying order or judgment. See 11
 
C
HARLES ALAN WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND
 
PROCEDURE § 2871 (2d ed. 1995). A family court's grant or denial
 
of a motion under HFCR Rule 60(b) is reviewed for abuse of
 discretion. De Mello v. De Mello, 3 Haw. App. 165, 169, 646 P.2d
 
409, 412 (1982).
 
An abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court
 
has clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded
rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial
detriment of a party litigant. In addition, the burden of
establishing abuse of discretion is on appellant, and a
strong showing is required to establish it.
 
In re RGB, 123 Hawai' i 1, 16–17, 229 P.3d 1066, 1081–82 (2010) 
(citations, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The record and Jacqueline's briefing provide no basis
 
to warrant relief under HFCR Rule 60(b). The Family Court stated
 
three reasons for denying Jacqueline's January 22, 2010 Second
 Request for Reconsideration: (i) the request was untimely under
 HFCR Rule 59(e); (ii) the request "does not present any new
 evidence that was not previously submitted by [Jacqueline] at the
 December 9, 2009 hearing"; and (iii) "a substantial portion of
 [the request] is not relevant to the relief sought in
 [Jacqueline's] Motion and Affidavit for Post Decree Relief filed
 on September 3, 2009." The first of the three reasons is
 inapplicable here because we treat the request as a motion for
 relief under HFCR Rule 60(b). The third reason appears
 insufficient in that a substantial portion of Jacqueline's Second
 Request for Reconsideration nevertheless did relate to the relief
 she sought.
2 The second reason, however, is sufficient to

that she was "essentially homeless," William's alleged failure to make

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
justify the Family Court's decision and leads us to conclude that
 
the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the January 22,
 2010 Second Request for Reconsideration.
 
The purpose of a motion for relief, like a motion for
 
reconsideration "is to allow the parties to present new evidence
 and/or arguments that could not have been presented during the
 earlier adjudicated motion." See Schiller v. Schiller, 120
 
Hawai'i 283, 288, 205 P.3d 548, 553 (App. 2009). It "is not a 
device to relitigate old matters . . . ." See id.; see also
 
J
AMES WM.  MOORE,  MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE ¶ 60.03[4] (3d ed. 2009) (the
 
standard for granting relief under Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b)
 differs only slightly; Rule 59(e) motions are subject to a
 somewhat "lower threshold of proof" than Rule 60(b) motions).
 
Jacqueline's opening brief does not address the Family
 
Court's conclusion that the January 22, 2010 Second Request for
 Reconsideration does not present any new evidence that was not
 previously submitted at the December 9, 2009 hearing. 
Instead,
 
the opening brief focuses on Jacqueline's claim that the court
 was inconsistent over the course of several rulings, which
 culminated with the December 9, 2009 hearing. As such, the issue
 is waived.
3 Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7); Jou v. Schmidt, 117
 
required alimony payments since 1966, and her ongoing medical– and dental–care
needs. The January 22, 2010 Second Request for Reconsideration argued that
the court, in denying an increase in alimony, had failed to consider a
declaration dated November 24, 2009, which, Jacqueline claimed, had a file-
stamped date of November 27, 2009, but was not received by the Family Court
until December 11, 2009. Additionally, the Second Request for Reconsideration
addresses at some length the evidence introduced by William in support of his
claim that support payments should be terminated. As such, the issues
addressed in the January 22, 2010 Second Request for Reconsideration appear
reasonably related to the issues addressed in the September 3, 2009 motion and
at the December 9, 2009 hearing.
 
3
 Furthermore, Jacqueline does not appeal from or address the Family
Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, filed April 1, 2010. As
 such, she does not challenge conclusion of law no. 9 where the court held
that:
 
Jacqueline's January 22, 2010, Second Reconsideration 
Order [sic] did not allege or establish that it was based on
newly discovered evidence or on legal claims that could nothave been discovered in advance of or presented at the timeof the December 9, 2009, hearing, notwithstanding her due
diligence. Therefore, the Second Reconsideration Motion did 
not allege or establish grounds for reconsideration of the
Court's January 4, 2010, Post-Decree Order. Sousaris [v. 
Miller, 92 Hawai' i 505, 513, 993 P.2d 539, 547 (2000)]. 
We are bound by the unchallenged conclusion. Wong v. Cayetano, 111 Hawai' i 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i 502, 504, 184 P.3d 817, 819 (2008). Irrespective of 
Jacqueline's failure to address the Family Court's "no new
 
4
evidence" determination,  we are presented with no basis upon
which to conclude that the Family Court abused its discretion in
 denying Jacqueline's January 22, 2010 Second Request for
 Reconsideration for the reasons expressed by the court in its
 February 16, 2010 Order Denying Second Request for
 Reconsideration.
 
III. Conclusion
 
Therefore, the February 16, 2010 Order Denying Second
 
Request for Reconsideration is affirmed. We lack jurisdiction to
 
consider the remainder of the issues raised and the orders
 appealed from.

 Even if we ignored Jacqueline's waiver of the issue and the
binding nature of the unchallenged conclusion and conducted our own
comparison, the only possible new evidence or argument in the January 22, 2010
Second Request for Reconsideration is Jacqueline's initial contention that the
Family Court failed to consider what she refers to as the November 24, 2009
Supporting Declaration which she says pre-dated the November 27, 2009
Supporting Declaration that was received and referred to in the December 9,
2009 hearing. According to Jacqueline, the November 24, 2009 Supporting
Declaration "shows a Hawaii Court LDB(FIO)file [sic] stamp of Nov. 27, but was
not received by the Family Court Division until Dec. 11, 2009, two full weeks
later, and two days after the Dec. 9 hearing (Ex. 'A')." (Emphasis removed).
The document attached as "Ex. 'A'," however, is not a declaration at all, but
an exhibit list with a received "LDB (FIO)" date of November 27, 2009, and a
family court received date stamp of December 11, 2009. The document itself
 addresses no argument and presents no information. In addition, absent the
referenced declaration, we cannot determine that the information addressed in
the January 22, 2009 Second Request for Reconsideration had any evidentiary
basis. Therefore, the reference to the November 24, 2009 Supporting
Declaration in the January 22, 2009 Second Request for Reconsideration is not
new evidence or argument.
