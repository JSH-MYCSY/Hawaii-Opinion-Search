appeals from the December 29, 2009 Judgment entered in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district

court)  convicting him of the offenses of Excessive Speeding in
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105 (2007 &

 HRS § 291C-105 provides, in pertinent part,
 
Excessive speeding.  (a) No person shall drive a
motor vehicle at a speed exceeding:
 
(1)	 The applicable state or county speed limit by
thirty miles per hour or more; or
 
(2)	 Eighty miles per hour or more irrespective of
the applicable state or county speed limit.
 
(b)	 For the purposes of this section, "the
applicable state or county speed limit" means:

(2007).
 
On appeal, Tennis contends that (1) the district court
 
erred by admitting the speed check card as a business record
 
under Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 803(b)(6),
 
(2) inadequate foundation was laid for the admission of the speed
 
check card, (3) admission of the speed check card was a violation
 
of his right to confrontation, and (4) testimony of Officer
 
Cullen Kau (Officer Kau) as to the speed was improperly admitted,
 
and (5) insufficient evidence of a reckless state of mind existed
 
for the reckless driving conviction.
 
The State concedes that, pursuant to State v. 
Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i 354, 227 P.3d 520 (2010), insufficient 
foundation was laid for admission of the speed check card as a business record, but argues that sufficient evidence exists for 
conviction on the lesser included offense of Noncompliance with 
Speed Limit under HRS § 291C-102(a)(1) (2007) and for conviction 
of the reckless driving offense. 
Based on a careful review of the points on appeal, the
 
arguments made, the record, and the applicable authority, we
 
resolve Tennis's contentions as follows.
 
The record reflects that Tennis objected to the
 
admission of the speed check card based on a lack of foundation
 
and that there was insufficient evidence presented to satisfy the
 
foundational requirements of Fitzwater for admissibility of the
 
2(...continued)
(1)	 The maximum speed limit established by county
ordinance;
 
(2)	 The maximum speed limit established by official
signs placed by the director of transportation
on highways under the director's jurisdiction;
 or
 
(3)	 The maximum speed limit established pursuant to
section 291C-104 by the director of
transportation or the counties for school zones
and construction areas in their respective
jurisdictions.
 
(c) Any person who violates this section shall be
guilty of a petty misdemeanor . . . .

speed check card. Consequently, it was error to admit evidence 
of the speed check card and the speedometer reading based 
thereon. Thus it appears that the State's concession in this 
regard was well taken. State v. Wasson, 76 Hawai' i 415, 418, 879 
P.2d 520, 523 (1994). Because we reach this conclusion, we do not address Tennis's other points of error on the excessive 
speeding charge. 
In the absence of admissible evidence that Tennis's
 
speed was in excess of thirty miles over the speed limit, there
 
was insufficient evidence supporting his conviction for Excessive
 
Speeding and that conviction must be reversed.
 
Our next inquiry is whether sufficient evidence existed 
for conviction of the lesser included offense of Noncompliance 
with Speed Limit, in violation of HRS § 291C-102(a)(1).
3 In 
Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i at 360, 227 P.3d at 526 (emphasis added), 
where the district court judge determined that the officer's 
pacing speed was a "reasonably accurate clocking and 
irrespective" of the speed check card, the reviewing court 
determined that "there was sufficient evidence to establish that 
Fitzwater was driving his vehicle 'at a speed greater than the 
maximum speed limit' in violation of HRS § 291C-102(a)(1), based 
on Fitzwater's admission during his testimony that he was driving 
in excess of the speed limit, as well as [Officer] Ah Yat's 
testimony[,]" 122 Hawai' i at 378, 227 P.3d at 544. Although the 
district court in the instant case did not similarly state an alternative basis for its conviction, it appears that any error 
3 HRS § 291C-102 provides, in pertinent part, 
§291C-102 Noncompliance with speed limit prohibited.
(a) A person violates this section if the person drives:
 
(1)	 A motor vehicle at a speed greater than the
maximum speed limit other than provided in
section 291C-105; or
 
(2) A motor vehicle at a speed less than the minimum
speed limit, where the maximum or minimum speed limit is
established by county ordinance or by official signs placed
by the director of transportation on highways under the
director's jurisdiction.

in the district court's reliance on the speed established by 
Officer Kau's testimony regarding his speedometer reading was 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to the lesser included 
speeding infraction where Officer Kau testified that he observed 
Tennis increase the distance between their two vehicles while he 
maintained a steady speed, Tennis admitted to traveling at a 
speed of "70, 73" miles per hour, and where the defense conceded 
"perhaps guilty of the lesser included, which is the basic 
speeding." See State v. Bullard, 124 Hawai' i 270, 276, 241 P.3d 
562, 568 (App. 2010) (admission of speed check card was harmless in light of testimony establishing defendant's acceleration away 
from other vehicles and concession that he was speeding at a rate 
of 70-75 miles per hour). 
We conclude, under the facts of this case, that the
 
erroneous admission of the speed check card was harmless beyond a
 
reasonable doubt with respect to the lesser included speeding
 
infraction.
 
As to sufficient evidence of a reckless state of mind 
for the reckless driving charge, "viewing the evidence in the 
light most favorable to the prosecution" to determine whether 
"substantial evidence exists to support the conclusion of the 
trier of fact" and "giv[ing] due deference to the right of the 
trier of fact 'to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and 
draw reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced[,]'" it 
appears that sufficient evidence existed of the mens rea of the 
reckless driving charge. State v. Agard, 113 Hawai' i 321, 324, 
151 P.3d 802, 805 (2007) (quoting State v. Bui, 104 Hawai' i 462, 
467, 92 P.3d 471, 476 (2004)) and In re Doe, 107 Hawai' i 12, 19, 
108 P.3d 966, 973 (2005) (quoting State v. Lubong, 77 Hawai' i 
429, 432, 886 P.2d 766, 769 (App. 1994)). In the case at bar, 
the testimony reflected that Tennis, in "moderate traffic," when 
it was "dark" at "night", at a of speed of "70" or "70, 73" 
miles per hour at the fastest, passed several vehicles without 
signaling--at one point crossing from lane 1 (fast lane) to lane 
3, then back to lane 1, then all the way to lane 4, cutting some 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
vehicles off, and at one point tailgating less than a car length 
behind a vehicle, which "may have caused an accident" had the car 
in front of him braked. The district court, in its ruling found 
that "Officer Kau's testimony is more credible[,]" noted 
"moderate traffic[,]" and Tennis's "changing multiple lanes in 
one swoop," where he "did not even use a lane signal change," and 
"came close to another vehicle". Similar to Agard, 113 Hawai' i 
at 328-29, 151 P.3d at 809-10, the evidence here, taken in the strongest light for the prosecution and giving due deference to 
the trial court to determine credibility, "reasonably 
demonstrate[s] that [Tennis's] disregard of the risk to others 
was conscious and 'involve[d] a gross deviation from the standard 
of conduct that a law abiding person would observe in the same 
situation[.]'" 
Therefore, the December 29, 2009 Judgment of the
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is
 
vacated as to the Excessive Speeding conviction, and we remand
 
the case for entry of a judgment that Tennis committed the
 
traffic infraction of Noncompliance with Speed Limit, in
 
violation of HRS § 291C-102(a)(1), and we affirm the Judgment as
 
to the Reckless Driving conviction.
