STATE OF HAWAI» I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
HAROLD U. JIM, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
PUNA DIVISION
 
(CITATION NO. 3DTC-07-007647)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Ginzoa, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Harold U. Jim (Jim) appeals from 
the January 25, 2010 Judgment and Notice entered in the District 
Court of the Third Circuit, Puna Division (district court),1 
convicting him of Driving Without a License, in violation of 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 286-102 (2007). 
On appeal, Jim contends2 that the district court erred 
in convicting him where (1) it erroneously admitted and relied 
upon the State's Exhibit 1, paragraph 3, which represented that 
Jim was not exempt from the requirement of a license and (2) it 
failed to dismiss the complaint based upon Article XII of the 
Constitution of the State of Hawai
» i and the Hawaiian Homes 
Commission Act of 1920 (HHCA).

 Counsel for the State and counsel for Jim failed to comply with
provisions of Hawai »i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28. Counsel 
are cautioned that future failure to comply with the rules may result in
sanctions. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Based on a careful review of the points on appeal, the
 
arguments made, the record, and the applicable authority, we
 
resolve Jim's contentions as follows:
 
1. Evidence of absence of a license exemption.
 
Jim asserts that the district court erred in convicting
 
him where it erroneously admitted and relied upon the State's
 
Exhibit 1, paragraph 3, which represented that Jim was not exempt
 
from the requirement of a license.
 
HRS § 286-102(a) reads now as it did at the time of
 
Jim's citation:
 
(a) No person, except one exempted under section 286-105,
one who holds an instruction permit under section 286-110,
one who holds a provisional license under section 286-102.6,
one who holds a commercial driver's license issued under
 section 286-239, or one who holds a commercial driver's
license instruction permit issued under section 286-236,
shall operate any category of motor vehicles listed in this
section without first being appropriately examined and duly
licensed as a qualified driver of that category of motor
vehicles.
 
The State offered into evidence State's Exhibit 1,
 
which was a certificate issued by the custodian of driver
 
licensing records that reflected that on the date in question, 
Jim did not have a driver's license and, in paragraph 3, was not
 
exempted from a license under Section 286-105. Jim objected to
 
admission of State's Exhibit 1 on the basis that the HRS § 286­
105 exemptions "cannot be ascertained except by actually looking
 
at the vehicle or determining how the vehicle is being used at
 
any given time" and further asserted that basis in closing
 
argument.
 
In his opening brief on appeal, Jim advances a
 
different argument, that (1) the court and the public could not
 
know what "implements of husbandry and road machines" are where
 
they are not statutorily defined, and (2) where there is
 
ambiguity, the rule of lenity should control such that the
 
statute should be construed in favor of the accused.3 The

in his opening brief. An argument not raised in the opening brief cannot be

arguments on appeal were not the arguments made before the 
district court, and, therefore, are deemed waived. State v. 
Moses, 102 Hawai» i 449, 456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003) ("[a]s a 
general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at trial, 
that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal"). 
2. Motion to Dismiss the Complaint.
 
In his second point of error, Jim contends that the 
district court erred by failing to dismiss the complaint as an 
unconstitutional exercise of police power based upon Article XII 
of the Constitution of the State of Hawai» i and the HHCA. In his 
motion to dismiss before the district court, Jim asserted that State v. Jim , 80 Hawai» i 168, 907 P.2d 754 (1995), did not 
address the matters he is raising; that the State's exercise of police power is "in conflict with the aspect of racial equality 
in light of Article XII" of the Hawai
» i Constitution, which 
states that "encumbrances authorized not be placed on Hawaiian 
home lands by officers other than those charged with the 
administration of such Act, shall not be increased, except with 
the consent of the United States" and where exercise of the 
State's police power here is such an additional encumbrance; and 
that exercise of the police power is a breach of a contract 
between the federal government and the State for the benefit of 
native Hawaiians by means of the HHCA where it interferes with 
the responsibility to preserve native Hawaiian racial equality 
and where the supremacy clause states that federal law shall 
prevail. Additionally, in the district court, Jim argued that 
his status as nobility in the Kingdom of Hawai» i was compromised 
because Article I, Sections 9 and 10 of the U.S. Constitution prohibit any State from granting any title of nobility. On 
appeal, Jim raises essentially the same arguments.

raised for the first time in a reply brief, and such argument is deemed
waived. See State v. Mark, 123 Hawai »i 205, 230, 231 P.3d 478, 503 (2010)
(citing In re Hawaiian Flour Mills, Inc., 76 Hawai »i 1, 14 n.5, 868 P.2d 419,
432 n.5 (1994)). HRAP Rule 28(d) (providing that "[t]he reply brief shall be
confined to matters presented in the answering brief").

As to the issue of a breach of contract that conflicts 
with racial equality of Native Hawaiians, Jim has not cited to 
any evidence in the record establishing that he was on Hawaiian 
Home Lands property at the time he committed this offense. 
Moreover, the exercise of police powers of the State in the 
instant case is not in conflict with provisions of the HHCA as 
encompassed in Article XII of the Hawai» i Constitution. See 
State v. Bereday, 120 Hawai» i 486, 493-94, 210 P.3d 9, 16-17 
(App. 2009) (citing State v. Jim, 80 Hawai» i 168, 171-72, 907 
P.2d 754, 757-58 (1995)). Additionally, the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution is not abridged and no consent of Congress 
is required where there is no breach of contract by the exercise 
of police powers in the matter at bar. Jim
, 80 Hawai» i at 
171-72, 907 P.2d at 757-58; see State v. Jim,  105 Hawai» i 319, 
330-31, 97 P.3d 395, 406-07 (App. 2004) (following the precedent 
of State v. Jim , 80 Hawai» i 168, 907 P.2d 754, to defeat a claim 
that the complaint for obstructing government operations should 
be dismissed where the act occurred on Hawaiian Home Lands and is 
a breach of "trust as embodied in Congress' Homestead Act" and 
violates equal protection). As to Jim's contention regarding his 
status as nobility, he presented no evidence of this status, and, 
more importantly, no authority supporting his claim. The 
district court did not err in denying his motion to dismiss the 
complaint. 
Therefore, the January 25, 2010 Judgment and Notice
 
entered in the District Court of the Third Circuit, Puna
 
Division, is affirmed.
