NO. 30368
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STEVE DAVIS, Claimant-Appellant,
v.
 
JAYAR CONSTRUCTION, INC., Employer-Appellee,
and
 
JOHN MULLEN AND COMPANY, INC., Insurance Adjuster-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2003-509 (2-02-11752))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant Steve Davis (Davis) appeals from a
 
November 12, 2009 order approving attorney's fees and costs and a
 
February 2, 2010 order denying Davis's motion for reconsideration
 
of the order approving attorney's fees and costs, both issued by
 
the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB). 
The
 
LIRAB's orders approved fees and costs incurred by Davis's
 counsel, but did so as a lien against compensation payable by
 
Employer-Appellee Jayar Construction, Inc., (Jayar), rather than
 
as directly payable by Jayar.
 
On appeal, Davis's sole point of error is that the
 
LIRAB erred in not holding Jayar liable for the fees and costs on
 
appeal "as the non-prevailing party." Jayar counters that the
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
LIRAB correctly ruled because Jayar "prevailed on the crucial
 
issue on appeal."
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Davis's point of
 
error as follows:
 
Davis contends that the costs of the appeal proceedings
 
before the LIRAB should have been assessed against Jayar under
 
Hawaii Revised Statute § 386-93(b) (2011), which states:
 
If an employer appeals a decision of the director or
appellate board, the costs of the proceedings of the appellate
board or the appellate court, together with reasonable attorney's
fees, shall be assessed against the employer if the employer
loses; provided that if an employer or an insurance carrier, other
than the employer who appealed, is held liable for compensation,
the costs of the proceedings of the appellate board or the
appellate court, together with reasonable attorney's fees, shall
be assessed against the party held liable for the compensation.
 
(Emphasis added). For fees and costs to be awarded against
 
Jayar, the statute thus requires that an "employer appeals" and
 
that the "employer loses."
 
In this case, there is no dispute that Jayar is the
 
employer and that it appealed from the Decision issued by the
 
Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations
 
(DLIR) on October 7, 2003. The question is whether Jayar lost
 
its appeal before the LIRAB. Resolving this issue turns on
 
whether Jayar prevailed "on the crucial issue." See Mitchell v.
 
BWK Joint Venture, 57 Haw. 535, 551, 560 P.2d 1292, 1301 (1977);
 Yamada v. Royal Hawaiian Macadamia Nut Co., 5 Haw. App. 521, 524­
25, 704 P.2d 914, 916-17 (1985). The LIRAB correctly determined
 
that Jayar did not lose its appeal. 
Davis was involved in a work accident on August 23,
 
2002, wherein he fell from a machine and struck his head. 
Subsequently, eight months later on April 23, 2003, he
 
experienced an episode of left-sided numbness, headaches, loss of

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
balance, and drifting to the left while walking, which has been
 
described in the record as hemiparesis or a transient ischemic
 
attack (TIA). The Director's Decision on October 7, 2003
 
concluded, in pertinent part, that:
 
Regarding claimant's 4/23/2003 hemiparesis and neurological
work up, the Director determines that this condition is causually
[sic] related to 8/23/2002 work injury. . . .
 
Regarding the matter of TTD, the Director determines that
[Davis] is disabled for work beginning 5/1/2003 on an open-ended
basis less the statutory three-day waiting period. . . . The
 Director concludes that [Davis'] 4/23/2003 hemiparesis was work
related.
 
Jayar appealed from the Director's decision and on
 
December 1, 2003, filed its initial conference statement,
 
identifying the issues as "1. [w]hether the transient ischemic
 
attack of April 23, 2003 is causally related to the August 23,
 
2002 industrial accident" and "2. [w]hat is the extent of
 
temporary total disability attributable to the industrial
 
accident August 23, 2002." The LIRAB's Pretrial Order dated
 
December 9, 2003 thereafter identified the "issues to be
 
determined" as:
 
a.	 Whether the symptoms Claimant experienced on or about
April 23, 2003 are causally related to the work injury
of August 23, 2002.
 
b. 	What is the period of temporary total disability [TTD]
resulting from the work injury of August 23, 2002.
 
Thereafter, several remands to the DLIR took place to
 
address certain issues, and when the case was back before the
 
LIRAB further amended pretrial orders were issued. As ultimately
 
addressed in the LIRAB's Third Amended Pretrial Order dated
 
February 25, 2005, and reflected in the LIRAB's Decision and
 
Order dated June 13, 2006, the issues on appeal before the LIRAB
 
were:
 
(1) Whether Claimant's transient ischemic attack
 
("TIA") or left-sided hemiparesis experienced on or about
April 23, 2003, was causally related to the work injury of
August 23, 2002; and
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) What is the period of temporary total disability
("TTD") resulting from the work injury of August 23, 2002.
 
The parties agreed to waive an evidentiary hearing and
 
to submit the case on the record and simultaneous written
 
memoranda. In its "Post Hearing Brief" filed April 17, 2006,
 
Jayar argued that (1) the April 23, 2003 TIA was not causally
 
related to the August 23, 2002 industrial accident, (2) no
 
liability existed for medical care for the April 23, 2003
 
incident which was not causally related to the August 23, 2002
 
industrial accident, (3) no TTD was due from May 4, 2003 to
 
July 21, 2003, which period was attributable to the April 23,
 
2003 incident, and (4) Jayar should receive a credit for the TTD
 
paid from May 4, 2003 through July 21, 2003. Jayar's conclusion
 
stated:
 
Based on the overwhelming evidence that Claimant's
April 23, 2003 incident was not causally related to his
August 23, 2002 industrial accident, Employer/Adjuster
respectfully requests that the [LIRAB] find and determine
that the Director erred in finding that Claimant's April 23,
2003 incident was causally related to Claimant's August 23,
2002 industrial accident, and that the Director erred in
finding that Employer/Adjuster was liable for related
medical care and TTD related to Claimant's April 23, 2003
incident.
 
On June 13, 2006, the LIRAB issued its Decision and
 
Order in which the LIRAB stated:
 
[W]e reverse the Director to conclude that Claimant's TIA or
left-sided hemiparesis on April 23, 2003, was not causally
related to the August 23, 2002 work injury. We modify the
Director's decision on the period of TTD resulting from the
August 23, 2002 work injury.
 
The LIRAB concluded: (1) that the TIA was not causally related to
 
the August 23, 2002 work injury; and (2) that Davis was entitled
 
to TTD from June 28, 2003, on an open-ended basis as a result of
 
the August 23, 2002, work injury, but that Davis was not entitled
 
to TTD benefits for May 1, 2003 to June 24, 2003, because that
 
period was attributable to the TIA, which was not causally
 
related to the August 23, 2002 work incident.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
No further appeal was taken from the LIRAB's June 13,
 
2006 Decision and Order and thus it was the final determination
 
as to Jayar's appeal of the Director's Decision.
 
Based on the record in this case, the issues raised by
 
Jayar in its appeal from the Director's Decision, and the
 
Decision and Order issued by the LIRAB on Jayar's appeal, we
 
conclude that Jayar prevailed on the crucial issue in its appeal. 
See Mitchell, 57 Haw. 535, 560 P.2d 1292; Yamada, 5 Haw. App.
 
521, 704 P.2d 914. That is, Jayar prevailed given the LIRAB's
 
reversal of the Director's determination that the TIA or left-
sided hemiparesis on April 23, 2003, was causally related to the
 
August 23, 2002 work accident, and further, the LIRAB's
 
determination not to award TTD benefits for the period
 
attributable to the TIA.
 
THEREFORE,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the LIRAB's November 12, 2009
 
order approving attorney's fees and costs as a lien on
 compensation payable by Jayar, and the February 2, 2010 order
 
denying Davis's motion for reconsideration, are affirmed.
