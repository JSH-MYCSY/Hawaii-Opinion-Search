JAMES H. PFLUEGER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-0280)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
In this consolidated interlocutory appeal, Defendant-
Appellant James H. Pflueger (Pflueger or Defendant) appeals from
 
the (1) Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying
 
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss on Grounds of Double Jeopardy
 
(Double Jeopardy Order) filed on February 8, 2010 and (2)
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying
 
Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Insufficiency of the Evidence,
 
or in the Alternative, Due to Vagueness (Insufficiency of 
Evidence Order) filed on February 3, 2010 in the Circuit Court of
 
1
the Fifth Circuit  (circuit court) in State v. Pflueger, Cr. No.
08-1-0280.
 
Pflueger filed a Notice of Appeal from the Double
 
Jeopardy Order on March 3, 2010; the appeal was docketed as

No. 30369. This interlocutory appeal of the circuit court's 
Double Jeopardy Order is an immediately appealable collateral 
order. State v. Minn, 79 Hawai fi 461, 464, 903 P.2d 1282, 1285 
(1995) (While the appellate courts in Hawai fi "generally require 
the trial court's permission before bringing an interlocutory 
appeal, [the appellate courts] have held that such permission is 
not necessary where the trial court denies a pretrial motion to 
dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds."). 
On February 17, 2010, Pflueger filed a motion for leave
 
to file an interlocutory appeal from the Insufficiency of 
Evidence Order and for an extension of time to file the Notice of
 
Appeal. On March 29, 2010, the circuit court granted the motion
 
and certified the Insufficiency of Evidence Order for
 
interlocutory appeal. Pflueger filed a Notice of Appeal from the
 
Insufficiency of Evidence Order on April 1, 2010; the appeal was
 
docketed as No. 30419.2
 
On appeal, Pflueger contends:
 (1) In appeal No. 30369, the circuit court's Finding
 
of Fact (FOF) 15 in its Double Jeopardy Order is erroneous
 because the court found that the conduct for which Pflueger had
 
been convicted in 2003 was limited to the period of time between
 
February 2002 and December 31, 2002 and involved grading on the
 
3
south side of the Ka Loko  Reservoir (Reservoir) on the island of
Kauai and was not based on any grading in 1997-98 on the north
 
side of the Reservoir.
 
(2) In appeal No. 30369, the circuit court's
 
Conclusions of Law (COLs) 4 and 5 in its Double Jeopardy Order
 
are wrong because the conduct for which Pflueger was prosecuted
 
and convicted in 2003 was not "separate" from the conduct at
 
issue in the present prosecution and double jeopardy therefore
 
bars the instant prosecution.

 An order to consolidate appeal Nos. 30369 and 30419 was filed on
December 22, 2010 by this court.

 In the record on appeal, Ka Loko is also referred to as Kaloko and
Koloko.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
(3) In appeal No. 30419, the circuit court erred when
 
it held that the grand jury had sufficient evidence to establish
 
probable cause that Pflueger committed the offense of
 
Manslaughter as charged in Counts 1 through 7 of the indictment. 
In connection therewith, Pflueger argues that in the
 
Insufficiency of Evidence Order, FOF 2 was erroneous and COL 10
 
was wrong.
 
(4) In appeal No. 30419, the circuit court erred in
 
holding that Pflueger did not sustain his burden of showing that
 
as applied in this case, the manslaughter statute is vague. In
 
connection therewith, Pflueger argues that in the circuit court's
 
Insufficiency of Evidence Order, FOF 3 was erroneous and COLs 11
 
through 15 were wrong.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On November 21, 2008, a grand jury indicted Pflueger on 
seven counts of Manslaughter arising out of the March 14, 2006 
breach of the Reservoir that caused the deaths of seven people. 
The Reservoir is on property owned in part by Pflueger and in 
part by the Mary Lucas Trust, of which Pflueger was a trustee 
from the 1970s through 2004. The State of Hawai fi (State) 
alleged that when Pflueger covered or ordered others to cover the Reservoir's emergency spillway in late 1997 or early 1998 and did 
not uncover it in spite of warnings that it was not safe to leave 
it covered, he recklessly caused the deaths of the seven people 
who were in the path of the water when the dam breached. 
A. 1997 Notice of Grading Violation (First Notice)
 
4
On October 20, 1997,  Portugal and Associates, Inc., on
behalf of Pflueger, filed a grubbing permit application to grub5
 
4
 The application is dated October 20, 1997; the County of Kauai
Department of Public Works Investigator's Report refers to an application date
of October 22, 1997. Both dates appear to refer to the same application
prepared by Portugal and Associates, Inc. 
5
 In a memo to the file, John Buist (Buist), a County civil engineer,
explained "that grubbing work is the removal of the root structure of the
existing vegetation and that grading was the alteration of the existing ground
elevations, which influences natural drainage patterns."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
four acres to plant trees in the vicinity of the Reservoir. 
Because the application did not include grubbing plans, the
 
County of Kauai Department of Public Works (County) did not
 
process the application. The County conducted a field
 
investigation on November 7, 1997 and observed grading/grubbing 
activity of the hilltop, as well as the presence of two scrapers,
 
three bulldozers, and one excavator. On November 12, 1997,
 
Portugal and Associates, Inc. submitted to the County a
 
supplemental "vicinity map showing area to be grubbed,"
 
indicating an area above the Reservoir. On or about November 16,
 
1997, the County received a citizen's complaint about "grading
 
activity of a hilltop" in the vicinity of the Reservoir. On
 
November 18, 1997, the County issued Pflueger a "Notice of
 
6
Grading Violation for TMK: 5-1-002:001"  (First Notice), alleging
"[g]rading in excess of 100 cubic yard [sic] without a permit."
 
The grading in question was on the north side of the Reservoir,
 
where the dam was located. The alleged grading violated Kauai
 
County's Revised Code of Ordinance, Title VIII, Chapter 22,
 
Article 7, "An Ordinance Regulating and Controlling Grading,
 
Grubbing, and Stockpiling and Soil Erosion and Sedimentation
 
within the County of Kauai."
 
The notice instructed Pflueger that he was to comply
 
with the following:
 
1.	 Inform your contractor to stop work immediately with
the exception of work to correct any hazards to public
safety and health.
 
2. 	You are advised to provide temporary and remedial
mitigative measures to correct erosion and
sedimentation problems that may or have occurred.
 
Pflueger was given seven days to respond, and he was to
 
remedy the violation by December 19, 1997. However, according to
 
November 19, 2008 grand jury testimony by Wallace Kudo (Kudo), a
 
County civil engineer, the County did not follow up on the
 
notice. There was no further action on this First Notice until
 
6
 TMK (Tax Map Key) 5-1-002:001 (also referred to as TMK 5-1-2-1 or
5-1-02-01) refers to the property on which the Reservoir is located.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the County referred the notice to the County Attorney's Office on
 
May 31, 2002 and the Prosecutor's Office on June 19, 2002.
 
B. 2003 Notice of Grading Violation (Second Notice)
 
On June 21, 2002, following receipt of a complaint of a 
possible grading violation on Pflueger's Pila fa property, County 
and State personnel conducted an aerial site inspection of Pflueger's properties. 
In Kudo's January 13, 2003 Investigator's Report of the
 
aerial inspection, he wrote: "We observed cleared areas in the
 
vicinity of [the Reservoir] that appeared to be either a grubbing
 
or grading violation. The disturbed area is on the southerly
 
side of the reservoir." (Emphasis added.) The inspection team
 requested a follow-up onsite inspection.
 
A field inspection followed on July 3, 2003 to confirm
 
the grading at the south end of the Reservoir. Kudo's
 
Investigator's Report of the field inspection estimated that over
 
800 cubic yards of earth material had been recently moved from
 
the south side of the Reservoir. It appears that Kudo
 
erroneously thought the First Notice was for grading on the south
 
side of the Reservoir, because in a July 3, 2002 e-mail to his
 
supervisor, Ian Costa (Costa), regarding the field visit, Kudo
 
stated that "[w]e did observe recent grading activity at the
 
[Reservoir] that needs to be permitted. The grading at the
 
[R]eservoir is a continued violation of the . . . 1998 grading
 violation notice." (Emphasis added.) In a further status report
 
to Costa, Kudo wrote: 
We believe the area was graded and grubbed in 1998. Our
 
initial violation notice is dated November 18, 1997. We
 have given Pflueger (7) calendar days to correct the grading
violation upon receipt of the Second Notice of Grading
Violation which is dated July 11, 2002. This violation will
 be referred to our County Attorney's Office if we do not
receive a response.
 
The County sent Pflueger a "Second Notice of Grading
 
Violation, TMK: 5-1-02-01 Vicinity of [the Reservoir]" (Second
 
Notice) dated July 11, 2002. In the Second Notice, the County
 
stated:
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
This is a follow-up to our field investigation on
July 3, 2002 of the subject property and our notice of
grading violation dated November 18, 1997, a copy of which
is enclosed for your information and use. The subject
violation notice was received on 11/21/01. Although the
December 19, 1997 deadline has elapsed, we are still waiting
for your actions to correct the grading violation.
 
On behalf of the Mary Lucas Trust, Stringer Tusher and
 
Associates, an architectural firm, retained Belt Collins, an
 
engineering firm, to consult about remediation work at the north
 
and south sides of the Reservoir and to respond to the Second
 
Notice. On July 29, 2002, Belt Collins responded to the Second
 
Notice in a letter to the County:
 
It is our understanding that the 1997 notice relates
to grading of the northern slope of the [R]eservoir. We
 
understand that this slope has become naturally revegetated
and will not contribute to future erosion. In July of this
year, you observed a disturbed area that is not fully
vegetated. This area is on the south side of the
 [R]eservoir.
 
(Emphasis added.) Belt Collins stated its intent to implement an
 
Erosion Control Plan and provided a map which clearly marked the
 
"1997 Grading as "Revegetated" on the north side of the Reservoir
 
and the "2001-2002 Grading" on the south side of the Reservoir. 
Paul Wallrabenstein, a civil engineer formerly employed by Belt
 
Collins, testified before the grand jury that Belt Collins did
 
remediation work on the southern end of the Reservoir and some
 
regrading work on the north side of the Reservoir, but the
 
regrading work was a significant distance from the spillway. 
Belt Collins' response to the Second Notice affirmatively states
 
that the 1997 grading violation is separate from the 2002 grading
 
violation.
 
C. 2003 No Contest Plea
 
The State filed criminal Complaint CR. No. HC03-33
 
(District Court Complaint) on February 5, 2003 in the District
 
Court of the Fifth Circuit, Hanalei Division, (district court)
 
charging Pflueger with the offense of grading without a permit:
 
During the period of February 2002 through
December 31, 2002, in the County of Kauai, State of Hawaii,
JAMES PFLUEGER, intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, did
grading in excess of (100) cubic yards of material on any
one (1) site or did exceed five (5) feet in vertical height
 
6
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
or depth at its deepest point, on the property identified as
Tax Map Key No. 5-1-02-01, without a permit; thereby
committing the offense of grading without a permit . . . .
Additionally, pursuant to Section 22-7.20(b) of the Kauai
County Code, JAMES PFLUEGER did commit a new offense of
grading without a permit on each day that he failed to
comply with the County of Kauai's, Revised Code of
Ordinances, Title VIII, Chapter 22, Article 7, "An Ordinance
Regulating and Controlling Grading, Grubbing, Stockpiling
and Erosion and Sedimentation within the County of Kauai."
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
On March 12, 2003, Pflueger entered a no contest plea
 
to the charge in the District Court Complaint of "Violation of a
 
Grading Ordinance on or about February 1, 2002 in violation of
 
County of Kauai Code Section 22-07."
 
D. 2008 Manslaughter Indictment
 
On November 21, 2008, a grand jury indicted Pflueger on
 
seven counts of Manslaughter, in violation of HRS § 707-702(1)(a)
 
7
(1993 & Supp. 2002),  and one count of Reckless Endangering in
the First Degree, pursuant to HRS § 707-713 (1993).
8
 
On October 23, 2009, Pflueger filed a Motion to Dismiss
 
on Grounds of Double Jeopardy (Double Jeopardy Motion). On
 
November 9, 2009, he filed a Motion to Dismiss for Insufficiency
 
of the Evidence or, in the Alternative, Due to Vagueness
 
(Insufficiency of Evidence Motion).
 
The circuit court heard both motions on January 13,
 
2010. On February 3, 2010, the circuit court entered the
 
Insufficiency of Evidence Order, denying Pflueger's motion to
 
dismiss. On February 8, 2010, the circuit court entered the
 
Double Jeopardy Order, also denying Pflueger's motion to dismiss.
 
Pflueger timely appealed.
 
7
 HRS § 707-702(1)(a) provides:
 
HRS §707-702 Manslaughter. (1) A person commits the
offense of manslaughter if:
(a) He recklessly causes the death of another person[.]
8
 The circuit court granted Pflueger's motion to dismiss with prejudice
Count 8, Reckless Endangering in the First Degree, as barred by the statute of
limitations. The State did not appeal the dismissal.

II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Motion to Dismiss based on Double Jeopardy
 
A motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy is a 
question of constitutional law reviewed de novo under the 
right/wrong standard. Whiting v. State, 88 Hawai fi 356, 358, 966 
P.2d 1082, 1084 (1998). "We review questions of constitutional law by exercising our own independent constitutional judgment 
based on the facts of the case." State v. Rogan, 91 Hawai
fi 405, 
411, 984 P.2d 1231, 1237 (1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
B. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law
 
Pretrial findings of fact are reviewed under the 
clearly erroneous standard. State v. Locquiao, 100 Hawai
fi 195, 
203, 58 P.3d 1242, 1250 (2002). "A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to 
support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in 
support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left 
with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been 
made." State v. Okumura, 78 Hawai
fi 383, 392, 894 P.2d 80, 89 
(1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Pretrial conclusions of law are reviewed under the de novo standard. 
Locquiao, 100 Hawai
fi at 203, 58 P.3d at 1250 (quoting State v. 
Harada, 98 Hawai fi 18, 22, 41 P.3d 174, 178 (2002)). "A 
conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court's findings 
of fact and that reflects an application of the correct rule of 
law will not be overturned." Dan v. State, 76 Hawai fi 423, 428, 
879 P.2d 528, 533 (1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
C. Insufficiency of Grand Jury Evidence
 
[The Hawaif i Supreme Court] has previously stated that
"[a] motion to dismiss an indictment because of the
incompetency of evidence before a grand jury is addressed tothe discretion of the trial court. The decision of the trial court will not be reversed unless there has been abuse 
of such discretion." State v. Corpuz, 67 Haw. 438, 440, 690
P.2d 282, 284 (1984). "The trial court abuses its 
discretion when it clearly exceeds the bounds of reason ordisregards rules or principles of law or practice to the 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
substantial detriment of a party litigant." State v. 
Furutani, 76 Hawaif i 172, 179, 873 P.2d 51, 58 (1994)
(citations omitted). 
State v. Araki, 82 Hawai fi 474, 481, 923 P.2d 891, 898 (1996). 
"A grand jury indictment must be based on probable
cause." State v. Okumura, 59 Haw. 549, 550, 584 P.2d 117,
119 (1978). Probable cause is established by "a state of
facts as would lead a person of ordinary caution or prudence
to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion
of the guilt of the accused." State v. Chung, 75 Haw. 398,
409-10, 862 P.2d 1063, 1070 (1993). "The evidence to
 
support an indictment need not be sufficient to support a
conviction." State v. Ganal, 81 Hawaif i 358, 367, 917 P.2d
370, 379 (1996). "In reviewing the sufficiency of the
evidence to establish probable cause before the grand jury,
'every legitimate inference that may be drawn from the
evidence must be drawn in favor of the indictment and
 neither the trial court nor the appellate court on review
may substitute its judgment as to the weight of the evidence
for [that of] the Grand Jury.'" Id. (quoting State v. Kuba,
68 Haw. 184, 191, 706 P.2d 1305, 1310-11 (1985)).
 
State v. Ontai, 84 Hawai fi 56, 63, 929 P.2d 69, 76 (1996). 
D.	 Vagueness of the Manslaughter Statute as Applied
 
Due process of law requires that a penal statute state
with reasonable clarity the act it proscribes and provide
fixed standards for adjudging guilt, or the statute is void
for vagueness. Statutes must give the person of ordinary
intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what conduct
is prohibited so that he or she may choose between lawful
and unlawful conduct.
 
State v. Tripp, 71 Haw. 479, 482, 795 P.2d 280, 282 (1990)
 
(citations omitted). "Interpretation of a statute is a question
 
of law which we review de novo." Kikuchi v. Brown, 110 Hawai fi 
204, 207, 130 P.3d 1069, 1072 (App. 2006) (internal quotation
 marks and citation omitted).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 PFLUEGER IS NOT PROTECTED UNDER DOUBLE JEOPARDY
 
FOR THE 2008 MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE.
 
Pflueger contends in appeal No. 30369 that the circuit
 
court should have granted his Double Jeopardy Motion because the
 
evidence showed that the conduct he was convicted of in 2003 was
 
a continuing violation of the 1997-98 grading violation and
 
therefore the 2008 Manslaughter charges constituted the "same
 
conduct." State v. Feliciano, 107 Hawai
fi 469, 477, 115 P.3d 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
648, 656 (2005). Specifically, Pflueger contends that FOF 15 is
 
erroneous and COLs 4 and 5 are wrong.
 
FOF 15 provides:
 
15. The conduct that formed the basis of the 2003
 
conviction was illegal grading that occurred in 2002 on the
south side of the [R]eservoir, and was not based on any
grading in 1997-98 on the north side of the [R]eservoir,
involving the spillway.
 
COLs 4 and 5 provide, in part:
 
4. Under the "same conduct" test, the State does
not violate the double jeopardy clause under the State
Constitution in the prosecution of the instant case. In the
 Kauai County's prosecution in 2003, the [District Court
Complaint] in Cr. No. HCO3-33, to which [Pflueger] pled no
contest, clearly specifies the time frame as "During the
period of February 2002 through December 31, 2002" and was
based entirely on grading that was done in 2002 on the
southerly side of the [Reservoir]. 
5. In the instant case, there are acts, which
include the allegation that sometime in late 1997 through
early 1998, [Pflueger] filled/covered the spillway and/or
ordered or otherwise caused others to fill/cover the
spillway, that are the focus of this prosecution. As much
 as these acts are outside that time frame of Cr. No.
 HCO3-33, [Pflueger] has not been subjected to double
jeopardy based on the instant prosecution, even if the same
conduct test could ever bar a manslaughter prosecution for
deaths that occurred in 2006, based on a 2003 illegal
grading conviction (a question the court need not reach
here, as even if such a bar were possible, the 1997-98
grading was not the subject of the 2003 conviction).
Furthermore, the alleged filling/covering of the spillway
was done on the northern side of the [Reservoir] while the
grading that occurred in 2002, which was the subject of the
2003 conviction, took place on the southern side.
Therefore, the 2003 prosecution and instant prosecution
involve separate acts and [Pflueger] has not been subjected
to double jeopardy as the two prosecutions involved
different conducts under the "same conduct test" (even were
that test applicable to a manslaughter prosecution for
deaths that occurred in 2006, based on a 2003 illegal
grading conviction).
 
1. Protection under Double Jeopardy Clause
 
The United States and Hawai fi Constitutions protect 
persons against being tried twice for the same offense. The 
Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made 
applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, 
provides in relevant part: "No person shall . . . be subject for 
the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb." 
Likewise, Article 1, section 10 of the Hawai fi Constitution 
10
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
provides, in relevant part: "No person shall be . . . subject
 
for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy[.]"
 
The purpose behind barring multiple prosecutions for 
the same offense is to prevent the state, with all its resources 
and power, from subjecting an individual to the embarrassment, 
expense, and ordeal of another trial and forcing the person to 
live in a continuous state of anxiety and insecurity. State v. 
Kalaola, 124 Hawai fi 43, 51-52, 237 P.3d 1109, 1117-18 (2010) 
(citing to Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S. 
Ct. 221, 223 (1957)). The double jeopardy clause is intended to 
ensure "that individuals are not subjected to multiple 
prosecutions for a single act." State v. Lessary, 75 Haw. 446, 
457, 865 P.2d 150, 155 (1994) (emphasis added). 
Courts have applied double jeopardy protection to three
 
types of situations: (1) "a second prosecution for the same
 offense after acquittal," (2) "a second prosecution for the same
 
offense after conviction," and (3) "multiple punishments for the
 
same offense." Id. at 454, 865 P.2d at 154 (quoting North
 
Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 2076
 (1969)). The present case is focused on protection against "a
 
second prosecution for the same offense after conviction," where
 
Pflueger pled no contest in 2003 to charges of illegal grading. 
"There is a conviction if the prosecution resulted in . . . a
 
plea of . . . nolo contendere accepted by the court." HRS § 701­
110(3) (1993).
 
The Hawai
fi Supreme Court has held that the Hawai fi 
Constitution's double jeopardy clause provides greater 
protections against multiple prosecutions for the same conduct 
than is provided by the United States Constitution. Lessary, 75 
Haw. at 461, 865 P.2d at 157. To provide that protection, our supreme Court adopted the "same conduct" test set out in Grady v. 
9
Corbin, 495 U.S. 508, 521, 110 S. Ct. 2084, 2093 (1990) :  "[T]he
 
9
 Although Grady was overruled by United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688,
 
113 S. Ct. 2849 (1993), in which the United States Supreme Court reestablished
(continued...)
 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Double Jeopardy Clause bars any subsequent prosecution in which
 
the government, to establish an essential element of an offense
 
charged in that prosecution, will prove conduct that constitutes
 
an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted." 
Lessary, 75 Haw. at 457-58, 865 P.2d at 155.
 
In adopting the "same conduct" test, the Hawai fi 
Supreme Court stated: 
The double jeopardy clause of the Hawaif i Constitution 
prohibits the State from pursuing multiple prosecutions of
an individual for the same conduct. Prosecutions are for
 the same conduct if any act of the defendant is alleged to
constitute all or part of the conduct elements of the
offenses charged in the respective prosecutions. 
Id. at 461, 865 P.2d at 157. 
While the "same conduct" test protects a person from
 
multiple prosecutions for the same act, it does not
 
"unnecessarily restrict[] the ability of the State to prosecute
 
individuals who perform separate acts that independently
 
constitute separate offenses." Id. at 459, 865 P.2d at 156.
 
The State charged Lessary with Abuse of a Family or
 
Household Member, Unlawful Imprisonment in the First Degree, and
 
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree. Id. at 447-48, 865
 
P.2d at 151-52. Lessary allegedly drove to his estranged wife's
 place of work, went into her office, grabbed her by her head and
 
hair, threw her against a wall, threatened her and a co-worker
 
with a pair of scissors, dragged her out to his car, and
 
threatened her with the scissors again to force her into the car. 
Id. at 448-49, 865 P.2d at 152.
 
Lessary pled no contest to Abuse of a Family or
 
Household Member, and the question facing the supreme court was
 
whether double jeopardy protected him from being prosecuted for
 
the other two charges. Id. at 448-50, 865 P.2d at 151-52. The
 
State conceded that the "same conduct" test barred prosecution of
 
9(...continued)
the "same elements" test as the sole protection against double jeopardy, the
Hawaifi Supreme Court in Lessary declined to follow Dixon. Lessary, 75 Haw.

the unlawful imprisonment charge, id. at 460, 865 P.2d at 156, so
 
the only issue remaining was to apply the "same conduct" test to
 
determine if the conduct element of the terroristic threatening
 
charge was proved by acts independent of the acts used to prove
 
the conduct element in the abuse charge. Id. at 460-61, 865 P.2d
 
at 157.
 
The Abuse of a Family or Household Member conduct
 
element is "physically abusing a family or household member." 
Id. at 460, 865 P.2d at 157. The State used the acts of throwing
 
the victim against the wall and dragging her out to the car to
 
prove the abuse conduct element. Id. The terroristic
 
threatening conduct element is "threatening to cause bodily
 injury to another person." Id. at 460-61, 865 P.2d at 157. The
 
State indicated it would use Lessary's brandishing the scissors
 at the victim to prove the conduct element. Id. at 461, 865 P.2d
 
at 157. 
Because the act used to prove the terroristic
 
threatening conduct element (brandishing the scissors) was not
 the same as the acts used to prove the Abuse of a Family or
 
Household Member conduct element (throwing victim against wall
 
and dragging victim to car), the supreme court held that the two
 
offenses were not based on the "same conduct" and, therefore,
 
Lesssary was not protected under the double jeopardy clause. Id.
 
at 461, 865 P.2d at 157.
 
The supreme court also rejected Lessary's argument that 
"because the alleged threats were so closely intertwined with the acts of abuse, they constituted the 'same conduct.'" Id. 
Lessary was, in essence, arguing for the supreme court to apply the "same episode" test, which is based on "whether the alleged 
conduct was so closely related in time, place, and circumstances 
that a complete account of one charge cannot be related without 
referring to details of the other charge." Id. As explained by 
the supreme court, "the Hawai
fi Constitution does not require 
application of the 'same episode' test." Id.

2.	 Application of "same conduct" test to the instant
case
 
We apply the "same conduct" test set forth in Lessary
 
and Grady to the instant case. Under the "same conduct" test,
 
prosecution of the 2008 Manslaughter charge is barred by double
 
jeopardy if the acts for which Pflueger was prosecuted in 2003
 
are the same acts that will be used to prove the 2008 charge.
 
The conduct elements of grading without a permit, as
 
stated in the District Court Complaint, were that Pflueger,
 
during the period of February 2002 through December 31, 2002 on
 
the property identified as Tax Map Key No. 5-1-02-01: (1)
 
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly (2) did grading in excess
 
of one hundred cubic yards of material on any one site or in
 
excess of five feet in vertical height or depth at its deepest
 
point (3) without a permit.
 
The conduct elements of Manslaughter are that a person
 
(1) recklessly (2) causes the death (3) of another person. HRS
 
§ 707-702(1)(a). The State contended that it would rely on acts
 
different from those used to prove the conduct element of the
 
2003 conviction to prove the conduct elements of Manslaughter.
 
(a)	 2003 No Contest Plea to the District Court
 
Complaint
 
The State filed the District Court Complaint on
 
February 5, 2003, charging Pflueger with the petty misdemeanor
 
offense of grading without a permit between February and
 
December 31, 2002. Pflueger's March 12, 2003 no contest plea to
 
"Violation of a Grading Ordinance on or about February 1, 2002 in
 
violation of County of Kauai Code Section 22-07" indicates that
 
the act of grading without a permit was used to prove the conduct
 
element of the District Court Complaint. Also, the record
 
indicates, and Pflueger concedes in his opening brief in appeal
 
No. 30369, that the 2002 illegal grading was conducted on the
 
southern end of the Reservoir while the 1997 illegal grading was
 
conducted on the northern side.
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pflueger argues, notwithstanding the evidence that the 
2003 conviction was for illegal grading in 2002, that the "same 
conduct" test "requires a court to consider all potentially 
relevant sources of information in identifying the conduct at 
issue in a prior prosecution." He suggests that Lessary supports 
this conclusion because the Hawai fi Supreme Court looked outside 
the complaint to the transcript of the trial court. He also cites to Grady for the same proposition, noting that the United 
States Supreme Court based its analysis on conduct alleged in the 
state's bill of particulars. Finally, he cites to cases from 
other circuits to support the argument that, based on Grady, the 
court must look to the "entirety of the conduct," United States 
v. Uselton, 927 F.2d 905, 909 (6th Cir. 1991), for which Pflueger
 
was convicted in the 2003 case.
 
We agree with Pflueger that the circuit court is not
 
prohibited from, and in fact must, look to the "entirety of the
 
conduct" that was considered as the basis for the first
 
conviction. But we also conclude the circuit court carried out
 
such a review. The circuit court's FOFs 1 through 14 in its
 
Double Jeopardy Order are replete with information from sources
 
other than the District Court Complaint regarding the conduct and
 
acts leading up to the 2003 charges. The circuit court
 
considered that information and found in FOF 15 that "[t]he
 
conduct that formed the basis of the 2003 conviction was illegal
 
grading that occurred in 2002 on the south side of the
 
[R]eservoir, and was not based on any grading in 1997-98 on the
 
north side of the [R]eservoir, involving the spillway."
 
(b) 2008 Manslaughter Indictment
 
On November 21, 2008, a grand jury indicted Pflueger on
 
seven counts of Manslaughter, pursuant to HRS § 707-702(1)(a). 
In the State's Bill of Particulars, filed October 16, 2009, the
 
State contended that Pflueger was reckless when he "covered the
 
[Reservoir]/Kaloko Dam emergency spillway and/or caused it to be
 
covered; he left it covered and did not uncover it or cause it to
 
be uncovered despite warnings and/or requests that he should do
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
so; he increased the water level in the Reservoir and caused the
 
water level to be increased" and this conduct caused the deaths
 
of seven people.
 
The alleged illegal act of covering the spillway in
 
1997-98 and not subsequently uncovering it is not the same act as
 
illegally grading another section of the property sometime
 
between February and December 2002. The act of modifying the
 
water systems is also not the same act of illegal grading that
 
constituted the 2003 conviction. Hence, the acts the State
 
intends to use to prove the conduct element of the Manslaughter
 
charges are separate from the act used to prove the conduct
 
element of the 2003 conviction, and double jeopardy is not
 
invoked. 
Finally, we note that the double jeopardy clause is
 
generally invoked in cases where all the elements of the offenses
 
have been committed at the time of the first prosecution. In
 
such cases, the purpose behind the double jeopardy clause is
 
clear: 
One of the central objectives of the double jeopardy
prohibition against successive trials is to prevent
the state, with its unlimited resources, from using
the first trial in the appellate process to pinpoint
the inadequacies of its case. The double jeopardy
clause forbids a second trial for the purpose of
affording the prosecution "another opportunity to
supply evidence that it failed to muster in the first
trial."

Maldonado, 108 Hawai fi 436, 121 P.3d 901 (2005) (Double jeopardy 
protects a person "from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense." 
(Internal quotation marks and citation omitted.)) 
In the instant case, there is no danger that the State,
 
in 2003, was using that illegal grading prosecution to pinpoint
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
inadequacies in preparation for its 2008 Manslaughter case
 
because in 2003, the dam had not been breached and there had been 
no deaths.
 
B.	 THERE WAS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BEFORE THE GRAND
 
JURY TO ESTABLISH PROBABLE CAUSE THAT PFLUEGER
 COMMITTED THE OFFENSE OF MANSLAUGHTER
 
Pflueger contends the circuit court erred when it found
 
in FOF 2 and concluded in COL 10 of its Insufficiency of Evidence
 
Order (the same language appears in both paragraphs) that
 
"[t]here is sufficient evidence to support the grand jury's
 
finding of probable cause for the offense of Manslaughter as
 
charged in Counts 1 through 7 of the Indictment and Reckless
 
Endangering in the First Degree as charged in Count 8 of the
 
Indictment."
 
The grand jury's duty is to determine whether there is 
probable cause that a crime has been committed and criminal 
proceedings should begin. State v. Bell, 60 Haw. 241, 243, 589 
P.2d 517, 519 (1978), overruled on other grounds by State v. Chong, 86 Hawai
fi 282, 949 P.2d 122 (1997). The grand jury also 
has the duty to protect an individual from unwarranted prosecution. Chong, 86 Hawai
fi at 289, 949 P.2d at 129 (quoting 
Bell, 60 Haw. at 256-57, 589 P.2d at 526 (Kidwell, J., concurring)). The grand jury proceeding is not meant to be a 
mini-trial; the adversarial nature of a trial "is more properly 
reserved for the actual trial phase of prosecution." State v. 
O'Daniel, 62 Haw. 518, 520, 616 P.2d 1383, 1386 (1980) (quoting Bell, 60 Haw. at 244, 589 P.2d at 519). The grand jury does not 
weigh the evidence or strength of the case. "The function of a 
grand jury . . . does not entail a duty to weigh the 
prosecution's case against that of the defense, or even to 
determine that the prosecution's case is supported by competent 
evidence." Chong, 86 Hawai
fi at 289, 949 P.2d at 129 (quoting 
Bell, 60 Haw. at 256-57, 589 P.2d at 526 (Kidwell, J., concurring)). 
17
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pflueger incorrectly asserts that the circuit court's 
ruling on sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law 
reviewed de novo. Pflueger confuses sufficiency of the evidence, 
reviewed for abuse of discretion, Araki, 82 Hawai fi at 481, 923 
P.2d at 898, with sufficiency of the indictment, reviewed de novo as a question of law. State v. Moore, 82 Hawai
fi 202, 215, 921 
P.2d 122, 135 (1996). 
In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, the 
Hawaifi Supreme Court has held that "a motion to dismiss an 
indictment because of the incompetency of evidence before a grand 
jury is addressed to the discretion of the trial court." Araki, 
82 Hawai fi at 481, 923 P.2d at 898 (internal quotation marks, 
citation, and brackets omitted). 
In reviewing for sufficiency of the evidence, a court 
determines whether "sufficient legal and competent evidence" has 
been presented to the grand jury to establish "probable cause 
that a suspect has violated the law." State v. Kuba, 68 Haw. 
184, 190-91, 706 P.2d 1305, 1310 (1985). "Probable cause is established by a state of facts as would lead a person of 
ordinary caution or prudence to believe and conscientiously 
entertain a strong suspicion of the guilt of the accused." 
Ontai, 84 Hawai
fi at 63, 929 P.2d at 76 (internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted). Probable cause does not require the presentation of evidence that proves a defendant's guilt. 
Suspicion is not proof. Hence, to sustain an indictment, it
is not necessary to establish guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt, by clear and convincing evidence or even by a
preponderance of the evidence. It is not necessary to
establish guilt at all. It is merely necessary to establish
a situation where a strong suspicion of guilt would be
believed and conscientiously entertained by a man of
ordinary caution or prudence.
 
State v. Freedle, 1 Haw. App. 396, 400, 620 P.2d 740, 743 (1980).
 
The evidence required to support an indictment may be 
less than the evidence required to support a conviction, State v. 
Ganal, 81 Hawai fi 358, 367, 917 P.2d 370, 379 (1996), but the 
State still must produce "at least some evidence" of any "material element of the offense." Ontai, 84 Hawai
fi at 64, 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
929 P.2d at 77. Pflueger contends that "none of the evidence
 
presented in purported support of [the] allegations establishes a
 
'strong suspicion'" that he "knew of and disregarded a
 
substantial and unjustifiable risk that the decedents' deaths (or
 
anyone else's) would result." He argues that there was an
 
"absence of evidence to establish the required mens rea [of
 
recklessness]" and, therefore, the grand jury's finding of
 
probable cause is unwarranted.
 
"A person acts recklessly with respect to a result of
 
his conduct when he consciously disregards a substantial and
 
unjustifiable risk that his conduct will cause such a result." 
HRS § 702-206(3)(c) (1993). The State presented four days of
 
testimony before the grand jury, producing 20 witnesses and 207
 
exhibits and creating a record of 607 pages. This testimony
 
attempted to show, in part, that Pflueger knew of and disregarded
 
a substantial and unjustifiable risk that he was putting people's
 
lives at risk when he covered the spillway -- the Reservoir's
 
only emergency system to alleviate the pressure of too much water
 
in the Reservoir.
 
Because it is rarely possible to prove a defendant's 
state of mind by direct evidence, "the mind of an alleged 
offender may be read from his or her acts or conduct and the 
inferences fairly drawn from all of the circumstances." State v. 
Pudiquet, 82 Hawai fi 419, 425, 922 P.2d 1032, 1038 (App. 1996) 
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, there 
need not be direct evidence to create the "strong suspicion" that 
Pflueger was reckless. The grand jury can infer this "strong 
suspicion" of guilt from the testimony presented, determining 
that there is at least "some evidence," even by inference, to 
sustain its finding of probable cause. 
The State presented evidence of a fax sent from Michael
 
Dyer, a realtor with Kilauea Management Co., to Pflueger on
 
June 4, 1998. The fax read:
 
It looks to me as if the Ka Loko spillway is covered
with 8 to 10 feet of new fill. The reservoir is about 1 to
 
2 feet above the old full level. It would probably take at
 
19
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
least several months for Ka Loko to fill to the new level. 
Then I think water will flow over a broad area in the middle
 of your earth dam . . . just an eyeball guess.
 
I suggest you consider digging back down to the old
concrete spillway, setting a small culvert on the spillway
and then backfilling it to your current level. You would
 probably also need to cut a new overflow ditch to the valley
below your dam.
 
The grand jury also heard testimony from Thomas Hitch
 
10
(Hitch),  the owner of Kilauea Irrigation Co., as read by Agent
Lau, a Special Agent for the Department of the Attorney General. 
Hitch had testified that the portion of the road that crossed 
the spillway was concrete, making it very noticeable. He
 
explained that the spillway was the "only safety valve over the
 
entire reservoir . . . that's what dam construction is all about. 
It's common sense." Hitch had spoken with Pflueger in early 1998
 
after he saw that the spillway had been covered: "I said, Jimmy,
 
you can't -- you know, you can't fill in the spillway. It's our
 
only safety factor. And he said, Hey, mind your own business,
 
Hitch. It's my reservoir and I'll do what I want."
 
The State presented evidence to the grand jury that
 
proved people lived, worked and traveled on the land downstream
 
from the dam. The State submitted aerial photographs taken in
 
2006 showing homes located near the flood path and photographs
 
taken in 2006 showing Kuhio Highway in the downstream path of the
 
dam. The State presented evidence that Pflueger was aware that a
 
pipeline diverted water from the Reservoir to downstream users
 
and evidence that water from the Reservoir was used by farmers
 
downstream. The State also presented evidence that the Reservoir
 
contained 370 million gallons of water when it breached.
 
In reviewing the evidence before the grand jury, "every
 
legitimate inference that may be drawn from the evidence must be
 
drawn in favor of the indictment and neither the trial court nor
 
the appellate court on review may substitute its judgment as to
 
the weight of the evidence for that of the Grand Jury." Araki,
 
10 At the time of the grand jury hearing, Hitch was in southeast Asia.

Kuba, 68 Haw. at 191, 706 P.2d at 1310-11). 
Looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to 
the State, we conclude the State presented evidence to the grand 
jury that would, either through direct evidence or by inference, 
"lead a person of ordinary caution or prudence to believe and 
conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion of the guilt of the 
accused," Ontai, 84 Hawai fi at 63, 929 P.2d at 76; specifically, 
that Pflueger acted with a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death could result. The circuit 
court did not abuse its discretion when it found that there was 
"sufficient evidence to support the grand jury's finding of 
probable cause for the offense of Manslaughter." 
C.	 THE CIRCUIT COURT DID NOT ERR IN FINDING PFLUEGER
 
DID NOT SUSTAIN HIS BURDEN OF SHOWING THAT THE
 MANSLAUGHTER STATUTE WAS VAGUE AS APPLIED.
 
Pflueger contends, in the alternative, that the
 
Manslaughter statute, HRS § 707-702(1)(a), is unconstitutionally
 
vague as applied. He argues the Insufficiency of Evidence Order
 
FOF 3 is erroneous and COLs 11 through 15 are wrong.
 
FOF 3 provides:
 
3. The Manslaughter statute ([HRS] § 707-702) and
the Reckless Endangering in the First Degree statute ([HRS]
§ 707-713) are sufficiently definite and provide adequate
notice to the Defendant of the conduct prohibited by them
and of the crimes with which he is charged. Both statutes
 provide persons of ordinary intelligence an adequate
description of the prohibited conduct and notice of how to
avoid committing illegal acts.
 
COLs 11 through 15 provide:
 
11. Statutory enactments are presumptively
constitutional. Doe v. Doe, 116 [Hawaif i] 323, 172 P.3d
1067 (2007). 
12. A party claiming a statute is unconstitutional
"has the burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a
reasonable doubt." State v. Mallan, 86 [Hawaif i] 440, 950
P.2d 178 (1998). 
13. A criminal statute must "state with reasonable
 
clarity the act it proscribes" and "provide fixed standards
for adjudging guilt." In other words, it must provide a
person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to
 
21
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
know what conduct is prohibited. State v. Tripp, 71
[Hawaifi] 479, 795 P.2d 280 (1990). 
14. A criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague
"if a person of ordinary intelligence cannot obtain an
adequate description of the prohibited conduct or how to
avoid committing illegal acts." State v. Bui, 104 [Hawaif i]
462, 92 P.3d 471 (2004). 
15. Defendant has not sustained his burden of
 
showing the Manslaughter or Reckless Endangering in the
First Degree statutes are unconstitutional beyond a
reasonable doubt, and the Court finds both are
constitutional.
 
The Hawai fi Supreme Court has addressed vagueness 
challenges by applying the following principle:
 
A criminal statute must be sufficiently definite to give
notice of the required conduct to one who would avoid its
penalties, . . . [b]ut . . . most statutes must deal with
untold and unforeseen variations in factual situations, and
the practical necessities of discharging the business of
government inevitably limit the specificity with which
legislators can spell out prohibitions. Consequently, no
more than a reasonable degree of certainty can be demanded.
Nor is it unfair to require that one who deliberately goes
perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct shall take
the risk that he may cross the line.
 
State v. Kalani, 108 Hawai fi 279, 287, 118 P.3d 1222, 1230 (2005) 
(emphasis in original omitted) (quoting State v. Marley, 54 Haw.
 
450, 460, 509 P.2d 1095, 1103 (1973)). "[W]here possible, we
 
will read a penal statute in such a manner as to preserve its
 
constitutionality." State v. Richie, 88 Hawai fi 19, 31, 960 P.2d 
1227, 1239 (1998) (quoting State v. Bates, 84 Hawai fi 211, 220, 
933 P.2d 48, 57 (1997)).
 
The Hawai fi Supreme Court has long held that 
"(1) legislative enactments are presumptively
constitutional; (2) a party challenging a statutory schemehas the burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond areasonable doubt; and (3) the constitutional defect must be
clear, manifest, and unmistakable." State Organization of 
Police Officers (SHOPO) v. Society of Professional 
Journalists-University of Hawai' i Chapter, 83 Hawaif i 378, 
389, 927 P.2d 386, 397 (1996) (citing Pray v. Judicial 
Selection Comm'n, 75 Haw. 333, 340, 861 P.2d 723, 727 (1993)). See also [State v. Kam, 69 Haw. 483, 496, 748 P.2d 
372, 380 (1988); State v. Mueller, 66 Haw. 616, 626-27, 671
P.2d 1351, 1358 (1983)]. 
State v. Mallan, 86 Hawai fi 440, 446, 950 P.2d 178, 184 (1998). 
22
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Pflueger argues that his burden of proof to show
 
unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt does not apply to
 
vagueness challenges. He contends that Mallan, which the circuit
 
court cited to in COL 12, is inapplicable because Mallan involved
 
the right to privacy, not vagueness of a statute. In Mallan, the
 
appellant argued that he had a constitutional right to possess
 
marijuana and the statute criminalizing his possession of
 
marijuana violated his rights. Id. at 443 & 445, 950 P.2d at 181
 
& 183. The supreme court clearly stated that statutes are
 presumed constitutional and "the party attacking the statute must
 
show with convincing clarity that the statute is
 
unconstitutional." Id. at 466, 950 P.2d at 204. When a party
 
challenges the constitutionality of a statute, on whatever
 
grounds, it remains the party's burden to overcome the
 
presumption of constitutionality.
 
Pflueger also maintains that State v. Kam, 69 Haw. 483,
 
748 P.2d 372 (1988), supports his argument that it is not his
 
burden to prove unconstitutionality of a statute beyond a
 
reasonable doubt. Again, he misinterprets the supreme court's
 
analysis. In Kam, the supreme court reiterates the principle
 
that statutes are presumptively constitutional and the burden is
 
on the party challenging the statute to show the alleged
 
unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 496, 748
 
P.2d at 380. The court addresses the vagueness issue and finds
 that the statute in question is not vague. Id. at 488, 748 P.2d
 
at 375. Nowhere does the court suggest that a different burden
 of proof was applied. Notwithstanding his argument, Pflueger has
 
the burden of proof to show that the Manslaughter statute is
 
unconstitutionally vague.
 
Pflueger also contends that because there was no prior
 
case law citing facts similar to his case, he therefore lacked
 
notice that the Manslaughter statute could apply to his alleged
 
reckless conduct. However, he cites to no case law to support
 
his contention. 
23
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Pflueger also argues that because all reported Hawai fi 
Manslaughter cases involved situations where the culpable action 
of the defendant occurred almost simultaneously with the fatal 
result of the victim's death, the law requires that the death 
happen contemporaneously to the culpable action by the defendant. 
He cites to no Hawai fi case law to support a requirement that the 
Manslaughter statute is restricted to cases where the death occurs contemporaneously with the culpable action. He does cite 
to a Texas case, Collins v. State, 890 S.W.2d 893 (Tex. Ct. App. 
1994); however, this case does not support his contention that 
the Hawai
fi Manslaughter statute is void for vagueness as 
applied. In Collins, the mother ingested drugs during pregnancy, resulting in prenatal injury to the fetus that became apparent 
after the child's birth. Id. at 895. The state charged the 
mother with reckless injury to a child. Id. The Texas appellate 
court held that the mother's harmful conduct with respect to the 
fetus was not criminal conduct at the time she ingested the drugs 
because the child injury statute was limited to conduct against a 
person who has been born and is alive. Id. at 897-98. Because 
there was nothing in the Texas statute to give the mother notice that her prenatal conduct would violate the child injury statute 
if her conduct resulted in painful withdrawal symptoms by the 
child after birth, the court held that the statute was 
"impermissibly vague as applied to [the mother's] conduct." Id. 
at 898. 
In the instant case, the Manslaughter statute puts one 
on notice that it is a violation of the statute to commit any conduct in conscious disregard of the substantial risk of another 
person's death. The statute is not void for vagueness.
