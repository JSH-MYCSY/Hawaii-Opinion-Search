NO. 30373
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
JIMI MCKENNEY, Plaintiff-Appellant, v. STATE OF HAWAI' I,
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, Defendant-Appellee, and
JOHN DOES 1-10; JANE DOES 1-10; DOE CORPORATIONS and OTHER
ENTITIES 1-10, Defendants.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Third-Party Plaintiff/Appellee v.
PAUL FRENCH, Third-Party Defendant/Appellee 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 05-1-2304)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over this appeal that Plaintiff-Appellant Jimi
 
McKenney (McKenney) has asserted from the Honorable Gary W.B.
 
Chang's February 4, 2010 "Order Denying Plaintiff Jimi McKenney's
 
Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal Filed September 18, 2009"
 
(the February 4, 2010 order) because the February 4, 2010 order
 
is not an appealable final order pursuant to Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009).
 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the intermediate 
court of appeals from "final
 judgments, orders, or decrees[.]" 
(Emphasis added.) Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in 
the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641­
1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate 
document." (Emphasis added.) Based on this requirement, the 
Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that "[a]n appeal may be 
taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the 
appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1334, 1338 (1994). A judgment must "either resolve all claims 
against all parties or contain the finding necessary for 
certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An appeal from an 
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will 
be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." 
Alford v. City & County of Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 
809, 815 (2005) (emphasis added). For example, the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has held that, "[a]lthough RCCH [Rule] 12(q) 
[(regarding dismissal for want of prosecution)] does not mention the necessity of filing a separate document, HRCP [Rule] 58, as 
amended in 1990, expressly requires that 'every judgment be set 
forth on a separate document.'" Price v. Obayashi Hawaii 
Corporation, 81 Hawai' i 171, 176, 914 P.2d 1364, 1369 (1996) 
(emphasis added). 
In contrast, "the separate judgment requirement 
articulated in Jenkins is inapposite in the post-judgment 
context." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 158, 80 P.3d 974, 
979 (2003). Thus, "[a]n order denying a motion for post-judgment relief under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable final order under 
HRS § 641-1(a)." Id. at 160, 80 P.3d at 981 (citation omitted). 
Although the circuit court entered a entered a
 
September 18, 2009 order dismissing this case for lack of
 
prosecution, the circuit court has not yet reduced the
 
September 18, 2009 dismissal order to a separate judgment. While

McKenney moved the circuit court to set aside the September 18, 
2009 dismissal order, "a motion for reconsideration, pursuant to 
HRCP Rule 60(b), is authorized only in situations involving final 
judgments." Cho v. State, 115 Hawai' i 373, 382, 168 P.3d 17, 26 
(2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); Crown Props., Inc. v. Fin. Sec. Life Ins. Co., Ltd., 6 Haw. App. 105, 
112, 712 P.2d 504, 509 (1985) ("A Rule 60(b), HRCP, motion is 
authorized only in situations involving final judgments."); 
Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cochran, 8 Haw. App. 256, 262, 799 P.2d 
60, 65 (1990) ("Rule 60(b) applies to motions seeking to amend 
final orders in the nature of judgments."). Without a judgment 
in the instant case, "relief pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b) was not 
available[.]" Cho v. State, 115 Hawai' i at 383, 382, 168 P.3d at 
27. 
Although the February 4, 2010 order ended the 
proceedings for McKenney's motion to set aside the September 18, 2009 dismissal order, "an order is not final if the rights of a 
party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained 
for further action." Cho v. State, 115 Hawai' i at 383, 382, 168 
P.3d at 27 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Absent a final judgment, the February 4, 2010 order is not an 
order that the circuit court entered pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b), 
but, instead, the circuit court entered the February 4, 2010 
interlocutory order pursuant to the circuit court's inherent 
authority to revise "any . . . order or other form of 
decision . . . at any time before the entry of judgment 
adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all 
the parties." HRCP Rule 54(b). The February 4, 2010 order will 
not be eligible for appellate review until a party appeals from 
an appealable final judgment or order. Cf. Ueoka v Szymanski, 
107 Hawai' i 386, 396, 114 P.3d 892, 902 (2005) ("An appeal from a 
final judgment brings up for review all interlocutory orders not 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appealable directly as of right which deal with issues in the
 
case." (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).
 
Absent an appealable final judgment or order, we lack
 
jurisdiction over appellate court case number 30373. 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
