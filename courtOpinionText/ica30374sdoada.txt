BARDWELL JOSEPH EBERLY, Defendant-Appellant/Cross-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 06-1-1359 and CRIMINAL NO. 08-1-1565)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Bardwell Joseph Eberly (Eberly)
 
appeals from (1) the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (06-1­
1359 Judgment) filed on February 2, 2010, in the Circuit Court of
 the First Circuit (Circuit Court), in Cr. No. 06-1-1359, and (2)
 the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (08-1-1565 Judgment)
 
filed on the same date, in Cr. No. 08-1-1565 (collectively,
 
1
Judgments).  The cases were consolidated on appeal. 
On July 11, 2006, a Felony Information was filed in Cr.
 
No. 06-1-1359 charging Eberly with: 
(1) Count 1 - Unauthorized
 
Control of Propelled Vehicle, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 708-836 (UCPV); (2) Count 2 - Promoting a
 
Dangerous Drug in the 3rd Degree, in violation of HRS § 712-1243 
(Promoting 3rd), stemming from Eberly's knowing possession of
 
methamphetamine; (3) Count 3 - Unlawful Use of Drug

Paraphernalia, in violation of HRS § 329-43.5(a) (Drug
 
Paraphernalia); and (4) Count 4 - Promoting 3rd, stemming from
 
Eberly's knowing possession of cocaine. The offenses charged in
 
Cr. No. 06-1-1359 were committed on or about July 5, 2006.
 
During the pendency of Cr. No. 06-1-1359, Eberly was
 
released to a residential substance abuse treatment program. 
However, in February 2008, Eberly was terminated from the program
 
after he tested positive for cocaine and left the facility. A
 
bench warrant was issued for his arrest.
 
On October 6, 2008, a Felony Information was filed in
 
Cr. No. 08-1-1565 charging Eberly with: (1) Count 1 - Promoting
 
3rd, stemming from Eberly's knowing possession of cocaine; and
 
(2) Drug Paraphernalia. The offenses charged in Cr. No. 08-1­
1565 were committed on October 2, 2008, the date upon which
 
Eberly was arrested on the outstanding bench warrant.
 
On October 29, 2009, Eberly changed his plea from not
 
guilty to guilty in both cases. Eberly moved for and was granted
 
supervised release to a drug treatment facility. The State filed
 
motions for sentencing of a repeat offender in both cases and for
 
an extended term in the Cr. No. 08-1-1565.
 
The Circuit Court sentenced Eberly to a five-year term
 
of incarceration as to each count in Cr. No. 06-1-1359, sentences
 
to be served concurrently with each other and the sentences in
 
Cr. No. 08-1-1656, and a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment
 
of one year and eight months for Count 1, UCPV, with credit for
 
time served. The court sentenced him to five years of
 
incarceration as to each count in 08-1-1565, sentences to be
 
served concurrently with each other and the sentences in Cr. No.
 
06-1-1359, with credit for time served.
 
On appeal, Eberly contends that the Circuit Court erred
 
by sentencing Eberly as a repeat offender notwithstanding the
 
court's statement, in its conclusion of law, that Eberly was

qualified as a "first time drug offender" under HRS § 706-622.5
 
(Supp. 2008).2
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Eberly's point of error as follows:
 
We reject Eberly's argument that he is qualified for 
first-time drug offender status under HRS § 706-622.5, 
notwithstanding that he was a repeat drug offender, because he 
changed his pleas in both cases on the same day. See State v. 
Koch, 107 Hawai' i 215, 223-24, 112 P.3d 69, 77-78 (2005) (holding 
that defendant who committed multiple offenses of, inter alia, 
Promoting 3rd on separate occasions, 10 months apart, and who was 
charged and convicted in separate proceedings, was not a first-
time drug offender within the meaning of HRS § 706-622.5 because 
he was sentenced in both cases on the same day; "[s]entencing 
Koch in succession on the same date did not transform the two 
separate adjudications of guilt into a single criminal offense, 
thereby rendering him a first-time drug offender"); see also 
State v. Rodrigues, 68 Haw. 124, 706 P.2d 1293 (1985). 
Accordingly, the Circuit Court reached the right result, albeit 
for another reason. See id. at 224, 112 P.3d at 78; see also 
State v. Propios, 76 Hawai' i 474, 486, 879 P.2d 1057, 1069 (1994) 
("In any event, . . . the trial court reached the right result 
for the wrong reasons."); Lee v. Heftel, 81 Hawai' i 1, 2 n.2, 911 
P.2d 721, 722 n.2 (1996); State v. Pinero, 75 Haw. 282, 290, 859 P.2d 1369, 1373 (1993) (all cited in Koch).

 In 2009, HRS § 706-622.5(2) was amended in respects that are not
relevant to this case.
