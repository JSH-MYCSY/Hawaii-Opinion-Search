NO. 30376
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
HEINZ PINK, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
TERESA CASTRO, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT CIRCUIT
 
WAIALUA DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC-09-1-2589)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Heinz Pink (Pink) appeals pro se
 
from (1) the Judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Teresa
 
Castro (Castro) as to her counterclaim for breach of contract,
 
which was entered in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 
1
Waialua Division (District Court)  on February 17, 2010, and
(2)
 the underlying findings of fact and conclusions of law, which
 
were entered on November 12, 2009. He appears to argue that the
 District Court (1) was motivated by personal animus towards Pink;
 
(2) erred in its findings of fact by failing to recognize that
 
Castro had forged aspects of the contracts at issue; and
 
(3) erred in its findings of fact by failing to find that Castro

fraudulently induced Pink into signing a Section 8  rental
agreement.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and
 
arguments made by the parties, and in consideration of the record
 
in this case and the applicable statutory and case authorities,
 
we resolve Pink's appeal as follows.
 
We are hampered in the review of this case by the 
briefs filed by Pink as they are in wholesale noncompliance with 
the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure. Our appellate courts 
have "consistently adhered to the policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where 
possible," Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 
Hawai'i 408, 420, 32 P.3d 52, 64 (2001) (internal quotation marks 
and citation omitted; emphasis supplied), and have in several instances addressed the merits of an appeal, the nonconformance 
of the appellate briefs notwithstanding. see, e.g., Housing Fin. 
& Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85-86, 979 P.2d 1107, 
1111-12 (1999); O'Connor v. Diocese of Honolulu, 77 Hawai' i 383, 
386, 885 P.2d 361, 364 (1994). This is especially true where, as 
here, the litigant is pro se. 
However, Pink's opening brief does not advance 
meaningfully coherent legal arguments. Fundamental amongst the 
defects is the fact that, although Pink appears to challenge the 
findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the District 
Court, he has failed to direct this court to the evidence 
presented to the District Court that supports his allegations of 
error. As the Hawai' i Supreme Court observed long ago, 
Appellant has the burden of sustaining his allegations
of error against the presumption of correctness and
regularity that attend the decision of the lower court.
[T]he burden of showing error is on the plaintiffs in error.
We necessarily approach a case with the assumption that no
error has been committed upon the trial and until this
assumption has been overcome by a positive showing the
prevailing party is entitled to an affirmance.

516, 518 (1967) (punctuation altered).
 
Moreover, our review of the record finds support for
 
the District Court's finding that the parties signed the
 
Section 8 rental agreement. Under the applicable statutes,
 
regulations, and contract principles this rental agreement
 
controlled. 24 Code of Federal Regulations, §§ 982.308, 983.305,
