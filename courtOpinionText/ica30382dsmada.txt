NO. 30382
  The Honorable Simone C. Polak presided over this case in the1
District Court of the Second Circuit. IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI #I
JOHN P. DUNBAR, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI# I, Respondent-Appellee
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 2DTI-09-025858)
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant John P.
Dunbar (Appellant Dunbar) has asserted from the District Court of
the Second Circuit's1 January 22, 2010 judgment against Appellant
Dunbar for  noncompliance with the speed limit in violation of
HRS § 291C-102 (2007), because the appeal is untimely under
Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP).
Noncompliance with the speed limit in violation of HRS
§ 291C-102 (2007) is punishable by only a fine pursuant to HRS
§ 291C-161 (2007), and, thus, it constitutes a "'[t]raffic
infraction' . . . for which the prescribed penalties do not
include imprisonment[.]"  HRS § 291D-2 (2007).  "No Traffic
infraction shall be classified as a criminal offense."  HRS
§ 291D-3(a) (2007).  Under HRS Chapter 291D, contested traffic
citations are adjudicated at a hearing before a district court. 
An adjudication in favor of the State of Hawai #i may be followed
by a trial de novo before the district court conducted "pursuant
to the Hawaii rules of evidence and the rules of the district
court[.]"  HRS § 291D-13(a) (2007).  Rule 19(d) of the Hawai #i
Civil Traffic Rules (HCTR) provides that "[a]ppeals from
judgments entered after a trial may be taken in the manner
provided for appeals from district court civil judgments."  HCTR
Rule 19(d).  Appeals from district court civil judgments are
authorized by HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009) and, pursuant toNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
-2-HRAP Rule 4(a)(1), an appellant must file a notice of appeal
within thirty days after entry of the judgment.
Appellant Dunbar did not file his March 9, 2010 notice
of appeal within thirty days after entry of the January 22, 2010
judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) requires.  Therefore, Appellant
Dunbar's appeal is untimely.  "As a general rule, compliance with
the requirement of the timely filing of a notice of appeal is
jurisdictional, . . . and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion
if we lack jurisdiction."  Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai# i 10,
13, 897 P.2d 937, at 940 (1995) (citations, internal quotation
marks, and brackets omitted); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or
judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional
requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules.").  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, July 22, 2010.
