APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
(CASE NO. 2DTI-09-025858)
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ)  
Upon consideration of Petitioner-Appellant John P.
Dunbar's August 4, 2010 Motion for Reconsideration, the papers in
support, and the records and files herein, it appears that: (1)
pursuant to Rule 40(a) of the Hawai #i Rules of Appellate
Procedure, the motion for reconsideration is untimely; and (2)
notwithstanding Appellant's assertion that he sought to timely
file his notice of appeal, it was not filed until March 9, 2010,
well after the appeal deadline.  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the motion for
reconsideration is denied.  
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 16, 2010.
