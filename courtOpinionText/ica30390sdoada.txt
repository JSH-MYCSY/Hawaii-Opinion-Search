in violation of HRS § 134-8(c) (2011);  Count 7, Burglary in the
First Degree in violation of HRS § 708-810(1)(c) (1993); Count 8,
 
Robbery in the First Degree in violation of HRS § 707-840(1)(b)
 
(Supp. 2012); and Count 9, Kidnapping in violation of HRS § 707­
720 (1993 and Supp. 2012). Lindsey was sentenced to a term of
 
life imprisonment with the possibility of parole for Count 1,
 
terms of twenty years incarceration each for Counts 2, 8, and 9,
 
terms of ten years incarceration for Counts 3 and 7, and terms of
 
five years incarceration for Counts 4 and 5. The sentences for
 
Counts 2-9 were to be served consecutively to Count 1.
 
On appeal, Lindsey argues three main points: 
(1) the 
Circuit Court erroneously violated his speedy trial rights under 
Rule 48 of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP), and the 
United States and Hawai' i Constitutions; (2) he was substantially 
prejudiced by the Circuit Court's error in replacing Juror #9 
with an alternate on the third day of trial, because no effort 
was made to allow examination of that juror prior to the 
substitution, and no record or admissible factual basis was 
adduced to sustain the trial court's necessary finding that the 
juror was unable or disqualified to perform her duties; and (3) 
the Circuit Court erroneously deprived him of his statutory right 
to file a motion under HRPP Rule 33, where his inability to 
timely file such motion was caused by ineffective assistance of 
counsel, as well as the trial court's allowance of multiple 
withdrawal and substitutions of counsel preventing timely filing 
of any such motion. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, as well as the
 
relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Lindsey's points of
 
error as follows:
 
2
 Lindsey was found not guilty of Count 6, Terroristic Threatening
in the First Degree under HRS § 707-716(1)(d) (Supp. 2009).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) Lindsey has failed to establish a violation of his 
right to a speedy trial. HRPP Rule 48(b) "can be invoked only 
by a motion to dismiss made by the defendant." State v. 
McDowell, 66 Haw. 650, 651, 672 P.2d 554, 556 (1983) (abrogation on other grounds recognized by State v. Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 
56, 276 P.3d 617, 625 (2012)). Lindsey does not dispute that he filed no written motion to dismiss. Without citation to 
persuasive authority, Lindsey claims that he brought an oral 
motion asserting his speedy trial rights and made repeated 
objections to the continuances of trial sufficient to invoke HRPP 
Rule 48. However, the failure to cite to HRPP Rule 48 or to 
explicitly move to dismiss failed to alert the State of the need 
to litigate the causes for the periods of delay or alert the 
Circuit Court of the need to determine the facts relevant to a 
ruling under that rule and Lindsey does not point to any efforts 
on his part to demand such a ruling. Therefore, he has waived 
any claim to relief under HRPP Rule 48 and has failed to show 
plain error on this record. 
Lindsey has also failed to demonstrate that his 
constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated. Hawai' i 
courts have applied the four-part test articulated in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972) to determine whether an accused's 
constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated. State 
v. Almeida, 54 Haw. 443, 447, 509 P.2d 549, 552 (1973); State v. Dwyer, 78 Hawai' i 367, 371, 893 P.2d 795, 799 (1995). The four 
factors to be considered are: (1) length of delay; (2) reasons for the delay; (3) defendant's assertion of his or her right to a 
speedy trial; and (4) prejudice to the defendant. Id. 
Consideration of the four Barker factors together finds
 
that they weigh strongly toward the State. Lindsey did not move
 
to dismiss based on speedy trial grounds, although he did object
 
to the continuances granted. While the length of delay was
 
substantial, it was not purposeful and was based on valid
 
reasons. Barker, 407 U.S. at 531. Finally, Lindsey identifies
 
no prejudice apart from the length of his pretrial detention that
 
3

was caused by the delay. Thus, we conclude no plain error
 
occurred here.
 
(2) Lindsey's juror selection arguments fail. A "sound 
basis" supported by "sufficient facts demonstrating that [the] 
juror [] was unable to fulfill his duties" existed for dismissing 
Juror #9. State v. Crisostomo, 94 Hawai' i 282, 289, 12 P.3d 873, 
880 (2000). Mirroring the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCrP) Rule 24(c), HRPP Rule 24(c) has been interpreted as 
authorizing "the trial court, in its sound discretion, [to] 
remove an absent juror and substitute an alternate juror whenever 
facts are presented which convince the trial judge that the 
juror's ability to perform his or her duty as a juror is 
impaired." Crisostomo 94 Hawai' i at 288, 12 P.3d at 879 (quoting 
U.S. v. Rodriquez, 573 F.2d 330, 332 (5th Cir. 1978)) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). The Fifth Circuit in 
Rodriquez held that a juror's "absence manifestly interferes with 
the prompt trial of a case," and thus, "when a juror is absent 
from court for sufficiently long to interfere with the reasonable 
dispatch of business, there may be a 'sound' basis" upon which 
the trial judge exercised his discretion.
3 Rodriquez, 573 F.2d 
at 332. Citing Rodriguez, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that a 
trial court's concern about delay was a sound basis for replacing 
an absent juror. Crisostomo, 94 Hawai' i at 288-89, 12 P.3d at 
879-80. An absent juror is an immediately observable fact that does not require a hearing. Id. 
Mirroring the situation in Crisostomo, Juror #9 was
 
still at home when trial was set to begin for the day.
4 The

 In Rodriguez, before being replaced, the juror had informed the
 
court that he would be attending work, rather than returning to court that
day. 573 F.2d at 332.

 During the discussion at the September 23, 2009 proceeding, the
Circuit Court stated that it believed that Juror #9 lived in Kapolei. The juror in Crisostomo was in Ewa Beach when trial commenced for the day. It appears that Juror #9 called the Circuit Court at 8 a.m. It is not clear from the opinion when the trial court in Crisostomo became aware the subject jurorwas not present for the resumption of trial. 94 Hawai' i at 284, 12 P.3d at
882.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proceedings would have been further delayed if the court waited
 
for the juror to come in, and all of the other jurors, including
 
the alternate, were present. See Crisostomo at 288-289, 12 P.3d
 
at 879-880. Moreover, even after Juror #9 appeared, a hearing
 regarding her ability to serve would still be necessary causing
 
further delay. Juror #9's absence was itself the sound basis for
 
replacement.
 
Lindsey's argument that he was entitled to the 
particular jurors seated fails. The alternate juror was 
previously qualified by both parties and Lindsey fails to 
demonstrate any prejudice to him in allowing the alternate juror 
to be seated in place of Juror #9. Lindsey provides no evidence 
to refute the presumption that the alternate juror would be 
impartial and would follow the Circuit Court's instructions. See 
State v. Keohokapu, 127 Hawai' i 91, 112-13, 276 P.3d 660, 681-82 
(2012). The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that proceeding with one of the four available 
alternate jurors was the best course of action. 
(3) There was insufficient showing that trial counsel 
for Lindsey was ineffective. In order to be effective, the 
performance of defense counsel must be "within the range of 
competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases." State v. 
Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i 504, 514, 78 P.3d 317, 327 (2003) (internal 
quotation marks omitted). The "defendant has the burden of 
establishing ineffective assistance of counsel." State v. Silva, 
75 Haw. 419, 440, 864 P.2d 583, 593 (1993) (citation omitted). 
The mere fact that a HRPP Rule 33 motion for a new
 
trial was not filed despite Lindsey's desire to do so based on
 his claims of new evidence is not prima facie evidence of
 
ineffective assistance of counsel. Lindsey fails to meet his
 
burden of demonstrating that not bringing a motion for a new
 
trial was not a tactical decision on the part of his counsel, or
 
due to his counsel's belief that such a motion lacked sufficient
 
basis. This court has held that "[w]here an ineffective
 
assistance claim is based on counsel's failure to obtain a
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
witness, the defendant must produce affidavits or sworn 
statements describing the testimony of the proffered witnesses." 
State v. Forman, 125 Hawai' i 417, 425-26, 263 P.3d 127, 135-36 
(App. 2011) (citing State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 
1227, 1247 (1998)). No such sworn statements have been provided 
by Lindsey. 
Due to the lack of evidence included with the record,
 
we cannot evaluate Lindsey's argument that "in the interests of
 
justice," a new trial was appropriate due to newly discovered
 
evidence. Because Lindsey provides no evidence in support of his
 
claim that a new trial was warranted, we cannot say that his
 
counsel was ineffective in not moving for a new trial based on
 
his claim of new evidence.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the February 23, 2010 Final
 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered by the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit is affirmed, without prejudice to the filing
 
of a petition to examine Lindsey's claim of ineffective
 
assistance of counsel.
