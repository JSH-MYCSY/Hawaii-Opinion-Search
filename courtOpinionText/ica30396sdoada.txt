STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WADE MITSU YAMAMOTO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(1DTC-09-036457)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Wade Mitsu Yamamoto (Yamamoto)
 
appeals from the February 17, 2010 judgment and sentence, entered
 
by the Honolulu Division of the District Court of the First
 
1
 convicting him of the offense of
 Circuit (District Court),
Excessive Speeding in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (
HRS)
 
§ 291C-105 (2007).
 
On appeal, Yamamoto contends that: (1) the District
 
Court erred by admitting the speed check card as a business
 record under the Hawaii Rules of Evidence Rule 803(b)(6); (2) the
 
State failed to establish sufficient foundation for the
 
reliability of the speed check card; (3) the admission of the
 
speed check card violated Yamamoto's right to confrontation; and
 
(4)
 disregarding the inadmissible evidence, there is insufficient
 
evidence to sustain a conviction for Excessive Speeding.

The State concedes that, pursuant to State v. 
Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i 354, 227 P.3d 520 (2010), insufficient 
foundation was laid for admission of the speed check card as a 
business record, but argues that sufficient evidence exists for 
conviction on the lesser included offense of Noncompliance with 
Speed Limit under HRS § 291C–102(a)(1) (2007). 
Based on a careful review of the points on appeal, the
 
arguments made, the record, and the applicable authority, we
 
resolve Yamamoto's contentions as follows:
 
The record reflects that Yamamoto objected to the 
admission of the speed check card based on, inter alia, a lack of 
foundation and that there was insufficient evidence presented to 
satisfy the foundational requirements of Fitzwater for 
admissibility of the speed check card. Consequently, it was error 
to admit evidence of the speed check card and the speedometer 
reading based thereon. Thus, it appears that the State's 
concession in this regard was well taken. See State v. Wasson, 
76 Hawai' i 415, 418, 879 P.2d 520, 523 (1994). Because we 
reached this conclusion, we do not address Yamamoto's other 
points of error on the excessive speeding charge. In the absence 
of admissible evidence that Yamamoto's speed was in excess of 
thirty miles over the speed limit, there was insufficient 
evidence supporting his conviction for Excessive Speeding and 
that conviction must be reversed. 
Our next inquiry is whether sufficient evidence existed 
for conviction of the lesser included offense of Noncompliance 
with Speed Limit, in violation of HRS § 291C–102(a)(1). In 
Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i at 360, 227 P.3d at 526, where the 
district court judge determined that the officer's pacing speed was a "reasonably accurate clocking and irrespective" of the 
speed check card, the reviewing court determined that "there was 
sufficient evidence to establish that Fitzwater was driving his 
vehicle 'at a speed greater than the maximum speed limit' in

violation of HRS § 291-102(a)(1), based on Fitzwater's admission 
during his testimony that he was driving in excess of the speed 
limit, as well as [Officer] Ah Yat's testimony [,]" Id. at 378, 
227 P.3d at 544. Here, it appears that any error in the District 
Court's reliance on the speed established by Officer Lopes's 
testimony regarding her speedometer reading was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt as to the lesser included speeding infraction 
where Officer Lopes testified that the speed limit was 50 miles 
per hour, that she paced Yamamoto at a speed of well over 85 
miles per hour, Yamamoto passed at least four speed limit signs 
indicating the speed limit of 50 miles per hour, the officer 
observed Yamamoto changing lanes and cutting through traffic when 
he suddenly "took off", Yamamoto admitted that he "was going a 
little too fast", and Yamamoto admitted that he was traveling at 
a speed of "between 60 and 65" miles per hour. See State v. 
Bullard, 124 Hawai' i 270, 276, 241 P.3d 562, 568 (App. 2010); 
Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i at 378, 277 P.3d at 544. 
For these reasons, the District Court's February 17,
 
2010 Judgment and Sentence is vacated and the case is remanded
 with instructions to enter a judgment that Yamamoto committed the
 
traffic infraction of Noncompliance with Speed Limit, in
 
violation of HRS § 291C-102(a)(1).
