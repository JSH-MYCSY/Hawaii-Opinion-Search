NO. 30400
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JEFFREY LAMAR TUNLEY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CRIMINAL NO. 09-1-2151)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Jeffrey Lamar Tunley ("Tunley")
 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence ("Judgment")
 
filed on February 25, 2010, in the Family Court of the First
 Circuit ("Family Court").
1 Tunley was found guilty of Criminal
 
Contempt of Court in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS")
 ยง 707-1077 (1993), and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term
 of twenty days, with ten days ordered, and ten days suspended for
 one year. 
On appeal, Tunley contends (1) the Family Court erred
 
by failing to set forth the particular circumstances of the
 offense in the Judgment as required by HRS ยง 707-1077(5), (2)
 there was insufficient evidence to find him guilty of violating a

restraining order by approaching the complaining witness, (3) the
 
Family Court erred by admitting the distance measured by Officer
 Scott's strollometer into evidence without foundation for
 accuracy, (4) if the strollometer reading was properly admitted,
 there was insufficient evidence to support Tunley's conviction
 absent a showing that the margin of error was negligible, (5)
 there was insufficient evidence to establish that Tunley
 contacted the complaining witness in violation of the temporary
 restraining order, (6) the Family Court erred by sentencing
 Tunley to twenty days imprisonment for a de minimis infraction,
 and (7) the Family Court erred in denying Tunley the right to
 allocation before he was sentenced.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Tunley's appeal as follows:
 
The Family Court erred by failing to state the 
particular circumstances of the offense in the Judgment as required by HRS ยง 707-1077(5). Pursuant to HRS ยง 707-1077(5), the trial court must include the factual specifications in the judgment. State v. Lloyd, 88 Hawai
'i 188, 189, 964 P.2d 642, 643 
(1998). 
The Family Court further erred by failing to make any 
direct inquiry of Tunley's wish to address the court before imposing sentence. "The remedy for denial of a defendant's right to pre-sentence allocution is a remand for resentencing before a new sentencing judge." State v. Schaefer, 117 Hawai
'i 490, 498, 
184 P.3d 805, 813 (App. 2008). 
2

We need not address Tunley's other points of error 
until after the Family Court corrects the Judgment. See, Lloyd, 
supra, 88 Hawai 'i at 190, 964 P.2d at 644. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Judgment, filed on 
February 25, 2010 in the Family Court of the First Circuit, is vacated and the case is remanded (1) to the Family Court with specific instructions to enter a judgment stating the particular circumstances of the offense committed by Tunley, and (2) to a new sentencing judge thereafter for resentencing. Thereafter, Tunley is free to appeal said judgment and sentence in accordance with the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure.
