v.
NERISHA TAFUNA, Defendant-Appellant.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
KANE#OHE DIVISION
(CASE NO. 1DTA-10-00755)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
Defendant-Appellant Nerisha Tafuna (Tafuna) appeals
from the Judgment filed on February 24, 2010, in the District
Court of the First Circuit (District Court).1  Tafuna was charged
by complaint with operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
§ 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2009), as a first-time offender under HRS
§ 291E-61(b)(1) (Supp. 2009).  After a bench trial, the District
Court found Tafuna guilty as charged and imposed sentence. 
Tafuna did not challenge the sufficiency of the complaint in the
District Court.  
On appeal, Tafuna argues that (1) "[t]he District Court
erred in failing to sua sponte  dismiss the charge for failure toNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
2I.
We resolve Tafuna's arguments as follows:
A.
Tafuna's complaint was sufficient.  Because Tafuna
challenges the sufficiency of the complaint for the first time on
appeal, we apply the liberal construction rule:include the mens rea element"; and (2) "[HRS] § 806-28 (1993) [2]
violates due process under Art. I, § 5, of the [Hawai# i]
[C]onstitution."3  We affirm the District Court's Judgment.
Under the Motta/Wells post-conviction liberal construction
rule, we liberally construe charges challenged for the first
time on appeal.  Under this approach, there is a presumption
of validity for charges challenged subsequent to a
conviction.  In those circumstances, this court will not
reverse a conviction based upon a defective indictment or
complaint unless the defendant can show prejudice or that
the indictment or complaint cannot within reason be
construed to charge a crime.
 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai# i 383, 399-400, 219 P.3d 1170, 1186-
87 (2009)  (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets
omitted).  
We conclude that even if Tafuna had objected to the
sufficiency of the complaint in the District Court and the
liberal construction rule did not apply, the complaint was not
required to allege a mens rea in order to be sufficient.  State
v. Nesmith, No. CAAP-10-0000072 (Hawai# i App. June 22, 2011)
(holding that a complaint which did not allege a mens rea was
2 HRS § 806-28 provides in relevant part:
Characterization of the act.  The indictment need
not allege that the offense was committed or the act
done "feloniously", "unlawfully", "wilfully",
"knowingly", "maliciously", "with force and arms", or
otherwise except where such characterization is used in
the statutory definition of the offense. 
3 Article I, Section 5 of the Hawai# i Constitution provides
in relevant part:
Section 5.  No person shall be deprived of life,
liberty or property without due process of law[.]NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
3sufficient to charge the defendant with OVUII in violation of HRS
§ 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3), as a first-time offender under HRS
§ 291E-61(b)(1)).  Accordingly, it necessarily follows that
Tafuna's challenge to the sufficiency of the complaint must fail
under the liberal construction rule.
B.
We reject Tafuna's due process challenge to the
constitutionality of HRS § 806-28.  The Hawai #i Supreme Court has
"consistently held . . . that every enactment of the legislature
is presumptively constitutional, and a party challenging the
statute has the burden of showing unconstitutionality beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Schwab v. Ariyoshi, 58 Haw. 25, 31, 564 P.2d
135, 139 (1977).
Tafuna argues that if the elements of the offense must 
be alleged for a charge to be sufficient, then so must the mens
rea.  Tafuna, however, acknowledges that prior Hawai# i case law
is to the contrary, citing cases, including State v. Torres, 66
Haw. 281, 288-89, 660 P.2d 522, 527 (1983), and State v. Kane, 3
Haw. App. 450, 652 P.2d 642 (1982). 
In Torres, the Hawai #i Supreme Court considered the
sufficiency of an incest charge against Torres which alleged that
he "did commit an act of sexual intercourse" with his daughter.
Torres, 66 Haw. at 283 n.1, 660 P.2d at 524 n.1.  The statute
defining the incest offense did not specify a mental state and
the charge did not allege a mens rea.  Id. at 283-85, 660 P.2d at 
524-25.  The court acknowledged the prosecution's argument that
the charge was not deficient because HRS § 806-28 "expressly
provides that an indictment need not allege the crime was
committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, 'except where
such characterization is used in the statutory definition of the
offense.'"  Id. at 285, 660 P.2d at 625 (quoting HRS § 806-28).
Torres, however, argued that the charge was deficient on
constitutional due process grounds for failing to allege a
culpable state of mind.  Id. at 286, 660 P.2d at 525.  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
4The court rejected Torres's due process claim and
concluded that the incest charge was sufficient, reasoning as
follows:     
Our conclusion that the crime was unmistakably defined
despite the lack of an explicit averment of the mental state
accompanying the prohibited act rests on the nature of the
offense charged and the earlier conclusion that it is not a
crime that can be accidentally or innocently committed.  In
some situations knowledge or intent need not be alleged in
terms, and a pleading is good if it fairly imports knowledge
or intent.  Incest as charged here is an offense where
intent can be inferred because "sexual intercourse" under
the circumstances alleged could only be a wilful act.
Id. at 289, 660 P.2d at 527 (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted).4
In Kane, this court considered whether an indictment,
which, as authorized by HRS § 806-28, did not allege a mens rea,
violated Kane's constitutional rights.  Kane, 3 Haw. App. at 451,
454-55, 652 P.2d at 644-46.  We framed the issue as follows:
While HRS § 806–28 clearly authorizes the non-
allegation of the requisite state of mind in indictments
brought under HRS § 134–9, we must decide whether such an
indictment which takes advantage of HRS § 806–28's
permissiveness nonetheless violates Kane's rights under
article I, sections 10 and 14 of the Hawaii State
Constitution (1978).
Id. at 455, 652 P.2d at 646.  This court held that the indictment
gave Kane sufficient notice of the offense charged and did not
violate his constitutional rights.  Id. at 455-58, 652 P.2d at
646-48.  We concluded: "[T]he allegation in the indictment that
Kane 'did carry on his person a pistol or revolver without a
4 We note that while the court stated that intent could be
inferred because sexual intercourse under the circumstances
alleged "could only be a wilful act," it is possible to conceive
of situations, such as where two people are unaware they are
related, where acts of incest could be committed innocently or
unintentionally.  Thus, it is more accurate to say that intent
can inferred from the allegation that Torres engaged in
incestuous sexual intercourse because incest is rarely committed
innocently or unintentionally.  Similarly, because driving while
impaired by alcohol is rarely committed without a culpable mens
rea, an intentional, knowing, or reckless state of mind can be
inferred from the allegation that Tafuna operated or assumed
physical control of a vehicle while impaired by alcohol.   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
5permit or license to carry a firearm' was sufficient to imply
that Kane did so 'intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.' . . .
[A]n explicit allegation of Kane's state of mind was not required
in the indictment."  Id. at 458, 652 P.2d at 648.
In State v. McDowell, 66 Haw. 650, 650-51, 672 P.2d
554, 555 (1983), the Hawai #i Supreme Court adopted this court's
opinion in Kane in upholding the sufficiency of an indictment
that charged McDowell with possession of a sawed-off rifle.  The
supreme court cited HRS § 806-28 in support of its decision and
rejected the claim that a mens rea allegation in the indictment
was constitutionally required.  Id. at 651, 672 P.2d 554, 555. 
Based on Torres, McDowell, and Kane, we reject Tafuna's
claim that HRS § 806-28 is unconstitutional because it violates
due process.  Tafuna has failed to overcome the presumption that
the statute is constitutional as applied to her case.
