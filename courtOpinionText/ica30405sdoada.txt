LUCIANA BACCARAT HAUEN-LIMKILDE,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
MARTIN HAUEN-LIMKILDE,
Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-DIVORCE NO. 06-1-0423)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant (Father) appeals from the "Order Re
 
Child Support Issues" entered February 25, 2010 by the Family
 
1
Court of the Second Circuit  (family court).  Family court denied 
Father's request to reduce child support arrearage citing Hawai' i 
legal precedent that precluded it from retroactively modifying a 
child support order. 
On appeal, Father contends family court erred when it: 
(1)
 applied established legal precedent that Father argues should
 
be modified or reversed; and (2) failed to consider Father's

request to reduce child support arrearage under Hawai' i Family 
Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 60(b)(6). 
Upon careful review of the record and the opening brief
 
2
submitted by the Father  and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the Father, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude Father's
 
appeal is without merit.
 
A trial court's denial of a motion under HFCR Rule
 
60(b) is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. De
 
Mello v. De Mello
, 3 Haw. App. 165, 169, 646 P.2d 409, 412
 
(1982).
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decisions will not be set
aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. Thus,
we will not disturb the family court's decisions on appeal
unless the family court disregarded rules or principles of
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant and its decision clearly exceeded the bounds of
 reason.

(2001) (internal quotation marks, citations, brackets, and 
ellipsis omitted). 
Family court correctly concluded that the law is well
 
settled on the issue of retroactive modification of child support
 
orders. While family court may modify support payments
 
prospectively, such payments may not be modified retroactively.
