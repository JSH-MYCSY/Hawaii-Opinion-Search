FOLEY, PRESIDING J., LEONARD AND REIFURTH, JJ. 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY FOLEY, J. 
Defendant-Appellant Ray Cardona Andres (Andres) appeals 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on March 15, 
2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).1

 The Honorable Virginia Lea Crandall presided. 
FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Andres' sole point on appeal2
 is that the circuit court
erred in granting the Motion for Sentencing of Repeat Offender 
(Motion) filed by the State of Hawai
'i (State) and ordering that 
Andres was subject to the repeat offender sentencing provisions of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-606.5 (1993 & Supp. 2006). 
Andres contends the circuit court mistakenly relied on his prior 
federal conviction as a basis for granting the State's Motion. 
I.
 
On April 27, 2007, the State charged Andres with
 
Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree, in violation of
 
HRS § 712-1242(1)(b)(i) (Supp. 2010).
 
On May 21, 2008, the State filed the Motion, asking the
 
circuit court to sentence Andres as a repeat offender, pursuant
 
to HRS § 706-606.5(1), to a mandatory minimum term of three years
 
and four months of imprisonment, without the possibility of
 
parole. 
Andres filed a memorandum in opposition on January 21,
 
2009.
 
On July 9, 2009, the circuit court filed its Findings
 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Determining that Defendant
 Ray Cardona Andres Is Subject to Repeat Offender Sentencing
 
(FOF/COL/Order). The circuit court's determination that Andres
 
was subject to repeat offender sentencing pursuant to HRS § 706­
606.5 was based on Andres' prior federal conviction in 1991 for
 
"Attempt to Possess for Distribution Crystal Methamphetamine,
 
Schedule II controlled substance."
 
Andres' prior federal conviction was based on a 
November 28, 1990 charge in the United States District Court for 
the District of Hawai' i (district court) in Cr. No. 90-01779ACK

 Andres' opening brief fails to comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4)(ii)-(iii) in that he fails to state "where in
the record the alleged error occurred" and "where in the record the allegederror was objected to or . . . brought to the attention of the court."Andres' brief also fails to comply with Rule 28(b)(4)(C) by failing to quotethe finding or conclusion of the circuit court urged as error. Andres' counsel is warned that, pursuant to HRAP Rule 51, future non-compliance withHRAP 28 may result in sanctions against him.

for "attempt to possess for distribution a quantity in excess of
 
100 grams of crystal methamphetamine." Andres pled guilty on
 
March 4, 1991. The district court found Andres guilty on July 3,
 
1991 and entered the Judgment in a Criminal Case on July 8, 1991. 
The district court determined that Andres was subject to a range
 
of imprisonment from 121 to 151 months.
 
On November 30, 2009, in the instant case, a jury found
 
Andres guilty of Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree. 
The circuit court sentenced Andres on March 15, 2010 to ten years
 
of imprisonment and, after noting special circumstances, to a
 
reduced mandatory minimum of one year pursuant to HRS § 706­
606.5. The circuit court filed the Judgment on March 15, 2010,
 
and Andres timely appealed.
 
II.
 
The standard of review for statutory construction is 
well-established in this jurisdiction. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which the appellate court reviews 
de novo. State v. Heggland, 118 Hawai' i 425, 434, 193 P.3d 341, 
350 (2008). Where the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous, the appellate court's only duty is to give effect to 
the language's plain and obvious meaning. Id. 
III.
 
Andres contends the circuit court improperly found that
 
he was subject to repeat offender sentencing under HRS § 706­
606.5, which provides in relevant part:
 
§706-606.5 Sentencing of repeat offenders.  (1)
Notwithstanding section 706-669 and any other law to the
contrary, any person convicted of . . . any class B felony
. . . and who has a prior conviction or prior convictions
for the following felonies, including an attempt to commit
the same . . . or any felony conviction of another
jurisdiction, shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum
period of imprisonment without possibility of parole during
such period as follows:
 
(a) One prior felony conviction:
 . . . . 
(iii) Where the instant conviction is for a class B
felony -- three years, four months;
 
. . . . 
3
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) Except as in subsection (3), a person shall not
be sentenced to a mandatory minimum period of imprisonment
under this section unless the instant felony offense was
committed during such period as follows:
 
. . . . 
(f)	 Within the maximum term of imprisonment possible
after a prior felony conviction of another
jurisdiction.
 
(Emphasis added.) Andres argues that the circuit court
 
mistakenly relied on Conclusion of Law 6 (COL 6) in its
 
FOF/COL/Order as the legal basis for granting the State's Motion. 
COL 6 states: "When, on November 6, 2006, [Andres] committed the
 
offense of promoting a dangerous drug in the second degree, a
 
class B felony, he did so within the maximum term of imprisonment
 
possible after his July 3, 1991 conviction in Cr. No. 90­
01779ACK." Andres' argument is that the "maximum term of
 
imprisonment" of his prior federal conviction had expired before
 
the commission of his second crime.
 
This case turns on the definition of the phrase
 
"maximum term of imprisonment" as used in HRS § 706-606.5, which
 
determines the time frame in which a defendant may be charged
 
under the repeat offender statute. Andres argues that "maximum
 
term of imprisonment" refers to the maximum term of imprisonment
 
that the specific defendant could have received, not the maximum
 
term of imprisonment allowed by statute. He states that because
 
the Federal Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory at the time of
 
his conviction, the maximum term of imprisonment he could have
 
served was 151 months, which time period had expired prior to his
 
committing the second offense.3 In short, Andres argues that
 
this maximum term determined by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines
 should have been used in determining the applicability of the
 
repeat offender statute.
 
Conversely, the State argues that "maximum term of
 
imprisonment" means the statutory maximum term of imprisonment to
 
3
 Andres qualified for a total offense level of 32 and, as such, was
subject to a mandatory range of imprisonment from 121 to 151 months.

which a court could possibly sentence someone convicted of the
 
offense committed. The State further argues that because the
 
maximum term of imprisonment allowed by the federal statute (21
 
U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)) under which Andres was convicted is a life
 
sentence, the "maximum term of imprisonment" Andres faced was
 
life in prison and, therefore, Andres' second offense was
 
committed within the "maximum term of imprisonment" of his prior
 
conviction. The State does not dispute that the maximum sentence
 
under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines that Andres received for
 
his prior offense was 151 months. In essence, the State argues
 
that it is not the maximum sentence the individual defendant
 
could have received, but rather the longest sentence allowed
 
under the statute that constitutes the "maximum term of
 
imprisonment." 
In Heggland, the Hawai' i Supreme Court was asked to 
clarify whether Colorado's mandatory parole term after a prison 
sentence was part of a defendant's "maximum term of imprisonment" 
under HRS § 706-605. The court held that "[t]he phrase 'maximum 
term of imprisonment possible' in HRS § 706-606.5(2)(f) . . . 
refers to the maximum term of imprisonment to which a court in a 
foreign jurisdiction may possibly sentence a convicted 
defendant." Heggland, 118 Hawai' i at 436, 193 P.3d at 352. The 
court explained its reasoning that the statute "relies on the foreign jurisdiction's own assessment of the severity of the 
crime to determine whether mandatory minimum sentences should 
apply to a repeat offender." Id. at 436 n.6, 193 P.3d at 352 
n.6.
 
As the Hawai' i Supreme Court in Heggland looked to 
Colorado authority to determine what "maximum term of imprisonment" meant under Colorado law, we turn to federal 
authority in this case. Federal authority is clear: maximum 
term of imprisonment or statutory maximum comes from the United 
States Code, not the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. United 
States v. Ray, 484 F.3d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir. 2007); see also,

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
United States v. Hinson, 429 F.3d 114, 119 (5th Cir. 2005);
 
United States v. Work, 409 F.3d 484, 488-92 (1st Cir. 2005). 
Therefore, the circuit court did not err when it
 
concluded that Andres committed the offense of Promoting a
 
Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree within the maximum term of
 
imprisonment possible after his July 3, 1991 conviction in the
 
district court in Cr. No. 90-01779ACK.
