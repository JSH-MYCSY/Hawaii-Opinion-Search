NO. 30411
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
In the Matter of the Guardianship of the Person of SIMC
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-G NO. 09-1-0024K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not 
have jurisdiction over the appeal that Respondent-Appellant Ian 
Narod has asserted from the Honorable Aley K. Auna, Jr.'s, March 24, 2010 "Court's Decision" in FC-G No. 09-1-0024K (the March 24, 2010 decision), because the March 24, 2010 decision is not appealable pursuant to Hawai
'i Revised Statutes § 641-1 (1993 
& Supp. 2009) and Rule 34 of the Hawai 'i Probate Rules (HPR). 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from final judgments, 
orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641­1(c). HPR Rule 34 requires a trial court to reduce an order establishing a guardianship to a separate judgment as a prerequisite for appealability: 
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS
 
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of
the court. Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.

(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
 
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
 
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed
pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions.
 
HPR Rule 34 (emphases added). "Rule 34 is written to conform 
probate practice to the policy against piecemeal appeals, see, e.g., Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Haw. 115, 869 P.2d 1334, 1994 Haw. LEXIS 19 (1994)." Commentary to HPR Rule 34. Under the holding in Jenkins, "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 
Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "[A]n appeal from 
any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. Therefore, "an order disposing of a circuit 
court case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai
'i 14, 
21, 122 P.3d 809, 816 (2005) (citation omitted). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i at 120, 869 P.2d at 
1339. Accordingly, HRS § 641-1(a) and HPR Rule 34 require the entry of a separate judgment for the purpose of obtaining 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
appellate review of a guardianship proceeding that a court has
 
finally ended and closed.
 The March 24, 2010 decision appears to be an order
 
that establishes a guardianship, but the family court has not yet
 reduced the March 24, 2010 decision to a separate judgment in 
FC-G 09-1-024K, as HPR Rule 34 requires for a guardianship
 proceeding. Therefore, the March 24, 2010 decision is not
 appealable under HRS § 641-1(a) and HPR Rule 34. Absent an
 appealable judgment, we lack jurisdiction over appellate court
 case number 30411. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
