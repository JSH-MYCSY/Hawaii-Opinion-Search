IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI# I
In the Matter of the Guardianship of the Person of SIMC
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
(FC-G NO. 09-1-0024K)
ORDER DENYING RESPONDENT-APPELLANT IAN NAROD'S
AUGUST 5, 2010 HRAP RULE 40 MOTION TO RECONSIDER
JULY 26, 2010 ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
(By:  Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
Upon review of (1) the July 26, 2010 order dismissing
appellate court case number 30411 for lack of jurisdiction,
(2) Respondent-Appellant Ian Narod's (Appellant Ian Narod)
August 5, 2010 (filed ex officio on August 3, 2010) motion to
reconsider the July 26, 2010 dismissal order pursuant of Rule 40
of the Hawai# i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the
record, it appears that this court did not overlook or
misapprehend any points of law or fact when this court entered
the July 26, 2010 dismissal order.  Therefore, Appellant Ian
Narod's August 5, 2010 HRAP Rule 40 motion to reconsider the
July 26, 2010 dismissal order lacks merit.  Accordingly,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant Ian Narod's
August 5, 2010 HRAP Rule 40 motion to reconsider the July 26,
2010 dismissal order is denied.
DATED:  Honolulu, Hawai# i, August 12, 2010.
