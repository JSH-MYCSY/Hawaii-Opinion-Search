NO. 30414
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
SIONE TALI TAUMOEPEAU, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 07-1-1741)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Defendant-Appellant Sione Tali Taumoepeau (Taumoepeau) 
appeals from the March 3, 2010 judgment of conviction and 
sentence of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit 
court).1 Taumoepeau was convicted on one count of Promoting a 
Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree, in violation of Hawaii 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 712-1243 (Supp. 2010), and sentenced to 
incarceration for five years. 
Taumoepeau argues that the circuit court violated Rule 
48 of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) and the U.S. 
and Hawai' i Constitutions, because trial was held 820 days 
following his arrest. He also argues that his trial counsel was 
ineffective for failing to file a motion to dismiss for lack of a 
speedy trial. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Taumoepeau's points on appeal as follows and affirm the
 
conviction.
 
(1) The circuit court did not commit plain error by
 
not dismissing the charges under HRPP Rule 48(b), given that
 
Taumoepeau did not file a motion to dismiss under that rule. 
"Rule 48(b), by its terms, can be invoked only by a motion to
 
dismiss made by the defendant." State v. McDowell, 66 Haw. 650,
 
651, 672 P.2d 554, 555-56 (1983). Accordingly, the circuit court
 
lacks authority to dismiss sua sponte the charges against
 
Taumoepeau based on Rule 48. See id.
 
(2) Taumoepeau's right to a speedy trial under the 
Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and article I, section 
14 of the Hawai' i Constitution was not violated. 
Taumoepeau and the State agree that we should apply the 
test given in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972). See also 
State v. Almeida, 54 Haw. 443, 447, 509 P.2d 549, 551-52 (1973) (adopting the Barker test). Under Barker, we consider four 
factors in determining whether a trial was timely: "(1) length 
of delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the defendant's 
assertion of his or her right to speedy trial; and (4) prejudice 
to the defendant." State v. White, 92 Hawai' i 192, 201-02, 990 
P.2d 90, 99-100 (1999). 
The State concedes that the Barker inquiry was
 
triggered by the 820-day delay in starting trial.
 
As to the second Barker factor, although Taumoepeau 
conceded in his opening brief that the second Barker factor weighed against him, he asserts in his reply brief that this 
factor "may weigh" in his favor. The State argues this factor 
can be equally weighed for or against Taumoepeau. The Hawai' i 
Supreme court has acknowledged that "different weights should be assigned to different reasons for the delay in bringing an 
accused to trial." State v. Wasson, 76 Hawai' i 415, 420, 879 
P.2d 520, 525 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Taumoepeau's delays were attributable to his failure to appear 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
and his request for a continuance. The State concedes 
responsibility for some delays caused by the absence of its 
witness Officer John Locey (Ofr. Locey) and court congestion. 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court has 
considered court congestion as a "more neutral reason" for trial delay than deliberate attempts to hinder the defense and should 
accordingly "be weighted less heavily." Wasson, 76 Hawai' i at 
420, 879 P.2d at 525 (quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 531) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, there is nothing to suggest 
that Ofr. Locey's absence was a deliberate attempt to hinder the 
defense's case. Accordingly, this factor does not weigh in 
Taumoepeau's favor. 
Taumoepeau concedes the third factor weighs against him
 
because he never asserted his right to a speedy trial.
 
In evaluating the fourth Barker factor, courts look at 
the purpose of the constitutional right to a speedy trial: "(i) 
to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize 
anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the 
possibility that the defense will be impaired." Wasson, 76 
Hawai'i at 421, 879 P.2d at 526 (quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 532) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
Taumoepeau concedes that the first interest is 
inapplicable because Taumoepeau was out on bond for a substantial 
period before trial. He maintains the second interest weighs in 
his favor "because the length of [the] delay alone increased his 
anxiety." The supreme court has said that some anxiety can be 
assumed but "something more than a bare assertion of disquietude 
is generally required before this form of prejudice will weigh in 
favor of the accused." Wasson, 76 Hawai' i at 422, 897 P.2d at 
527. Taumoepeau does not present any evidence of "something
 
more."
 
Taumoepeau claims that he was prejudiced because he was
 
prevented from calling Moesolo Tuiloma (Tuiloma), who had died
 
before trial, as a witness. Taumoepeau does not make an offer of
 
proof regarding Tuiloma's testimony, nor does he indicate when
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Tuiloma passed away. Had Tuiloma died during the delay, that 
would weigh in favor of Taumoepeau. See White, 92 Hawai' i at 
205, 99 P.2d. at 103. However, Taumoepeau did not list Tuiloma in his naming of witnesses filed May 12, 2008, when a trial would 
have been timely, even according to Taumoepeau's analysis. We 
thereby infer that either Taumoepeau did not consider Tuiloma to 
be a material witness or he had already died, making the 
subsequent delay irrelevant. 
Taumoepeau claims that the delay prejudiced him because
 
it affected other witnesses' testimony at trial. He claims
 
Ofr. Locey "was vague on details and could not remember a large
 
portion of the events" and that his own witness Jerome Lauina
 
(Lauina), Tuiloma's uncle, "testified inconsistently and again
 
specifically gave conflicting information about where he and
 
other people were sitting in relation to [Taumoepeau]." However,
 
Taumoepeau does not cite specific inconsistencies present in
 
Lauina's testimony or important details Ofr. Locey was unable to
 
remember.
 
The one detail that Ofr. Locey could not remember that
 
Taumoepeau cites in his brief--whether anyone else was seated at
 
the table with Taumoepeau when Ofr. Locey arrived on scene after
 
Officer David Lacuata (Ofr. Lacuata) to photograph and recover
 
evidence--was testified to by Ofr. Lacuata. Taumoepeau does not
 
demonstrate that had trial occurred earlier, Ofr. Locey would not
 
have corroborated Ofr. Lacuata's testimony. The inconsistencies
 
are pronounced when Lauina's testimony is compared with Ofr.
 
Lacuata's, and is less likely attributable to fading memory
 
caused by the delayed trial and more likely to the witnesses'
 
relative credibility. Taumoepeau's arguments on appeal fail to
 
demonstrate that there was actual prejudice caused by the delay. 
Therefore, the fourth Barker factor weighs against Taumoepeau.
 
Given that the last three factors do not weigh in
 
Taumoepeau's favor, he can rely only on the first Barker factor. 
Although where there is an "exceedingly long delay" between
 
arrest and trial, "the presumption of evidentiary prejudice may
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
become so strong that, if not 'persuasively rebutted' by the 
prosecution, it will entitle the accused to relief, even absent 
specifically demonstrable prejudice[,]" the delay must not be 
"caused nor acquiesced in by the accused." Wasson, 76 Hawai' i at 
422, 879 P.2d at 527 (citing Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 657-58 (1992)). Taumoepeau cites no authority that an 820­
day delay, much of which can be attributed to Taumoepeau himself, 
can serve as the basis for relief in the absence of other factors 
weighing in his favor. Applying Barker, Taumoepeau's 
constitutional rights were not violated. 
(3) Taumoepeau did not meet his burden of showing that 
the trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for 
dismissal under HRPP Rule 48. "Customarily, a HRPP Rule 40 
hearing is the proper method to address ineffective assistance of 
counsel claims." State v. Libero, 103 Hawai' i 490, 507, 83 P.3d 
753, 770 (App. 2003), abrogated on other grounds by State v. Frisbee, 114 Hawai' i 76, 83, 156 P.3d 1182, 1189 (2007). 
However, ineffective assistance of counsel claims can be entertained for the first time on appeal where the "record is 
sufficiently developed to determine whether there has been 
ineffective assistance of counsel[.]" State v. Silva, 75 Haw. 
419, 439, 864 P.2d 583, 592 (1993). The proper standard for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal is whether, 
"viewed as a whole, the assistance provided was within the range 
of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases." Dan v. 
State, 76 Hawai' i 423, 427, 879 P.2d 528, 532 (1994) (internal 
quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted). "[M]atters 
presumably within the judgment of counsel, like trial strategy, 
will rarely be second-guessed by judicial hindsight." State v. 
Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998) (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). The defendant has the 
burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. State 
v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i 504, 513-14, 78 P.3d 317, 326-27 (2003). 
The record in this case is inadequate, to determine the
 
reasons for delay, to determine whether Taumoepeau consented to
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the delay and whether that consent might have been given by 
counsel for tactical reasons. Because Taumoepeau failed to 
demonstrate that his trial counsel's failure to move for 
dismissal under HRPP resulted in the "withdrawal or substantial 
impairment of a potentially meritorious defense[,]" his 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails. Wakisaka, 102 
Hawai'i at 514, 78 P.3d at 327 (quoting State v. Aplaca, 74 Haw. 
54, 67, 837 P.2d 1298, 1305 (1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the March 3, 2010 judgment of
 
conviction and sentence of the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 is affirmed.
