APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-1-0233)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Virginia M. Phillips (Phillips)
 
appeals from the March 3, 2010 Judgment entered by the Circuit
 
Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court)1
 in favor of
Defendants-Appellees Robert and Jocelyn Godbout (Godbouts).
 
On appeal, Phillips argues that the Circuit Court erred
 
by failing to enforce a settlement agreement and by granting
 summary judgment to the Godbouts.
 
After a careful review of the issues raised and the
 
arguments made by the parties, the record, and the applicable
 
authority, we resolve Phillips's points on appeal as follows and
 
affirm.
 
1. The Circuit Court did not err in refusing to
 
enforce an alleged settlement agreement discussed by Phillips's

attorney and the Godbouts' insurance adjuster. Where the
 
determination of whether a settlement agreement was reached is
 
made by the circuit court without an evidentiary hearing, we
 
review that decision as if it were a summary judgment ruling. 
Miller v. Manuel, 9 Haw. App. 56, 63-64, 828 P.2d 286, 291-92
 
(1991). "Thus, the question is whether the evidence presented to
 
the trial court indicated that there was no genuine issue of
 
material fact and that as a matter of law the parties had entered
 
into a valid compromise agreement." Id. at 64, 828 P.2d 292.
 
Two days after the January 6, 2009 conversation between
 
Phillips's lawyer and the Godbouts' adjuster, a series of emails
 
and draft letters were exchanged between the parties' agents. 
Although it appears that the January 6, 2009 conversation did
 
result in the participants' understanding that the Godbouts would
 
pay $15,000 to Phillips, who in turn would dismiss this lawsuit,
 
it also appears that the subsequent correspondence between the
 
parties' agents included language and proposed amendments to the
 
language regarding indemnification. Subsequently, in letters
 
dated February 2, 2009, and February 9, 2009, both counsel
 
adhered to their respective positions that a release and
 
indemnity clause either had, or had not been a part of the
 
settlement agreement. As this series of exchanges ended without
 
consensus, there was evidence creating a genuine issue of
 
material fact regarding whether an agreement as to the indemnity
 
clause had been reached.
 
2. Phillips argues that Hawai 'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56(f)2
 precluded the granting of the
Godbouts' Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ). Phillips
 
2
 HRCP Rule 56. Summary Judgment, provides, in pertinent part, 
(f) When affidavits are unavailable. Should it appear
from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the
party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts
essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may
refuse the application for judgment or may order a
continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or
depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make
such other order as is just.

essentially argues that because she relied on the Circuit Court's
 
August 10, 2009 directive to continue working towards settlement
 
she ceased discovery3
 in the interim between August 10, 2009 and
October 6, 2009, when the settlement conference with the court
 was to resume. As a result, she argues she was unable to present
 
facts to oppose the Godbouts' MSJ.
 
This court has held that:
 
HRCP Rule 56(f) provides that the court may refuse to
grant summary judgment if the party opposing the motion
submits affidavits setting forth the reasons why he cannot
present by affidavit facts essential to justify his
opposition. If the stated reasons are deemed sufficient, the
court may grant a continuance of the motion to permit
affidavits to be obtained, depositions to be taken, or other
discovery to be had. 
Wilder v. Tanouye, 7 Haw. App. 247, 253, 753 P.2d 816, 820 
(1988). This court has also held that HRCP Rule 56(f) should be 
liberally construed. Marshall v. Univ. of Hawaii, 9 Haw. App. 
21, 29, 821 P.2d 937, 943 (1991), abrogated on other grounds by Hac v. Univ. of Hawai
'i, 102 Hawai 'i 92, 73 P.3d 46 (2003) (Lack 
of adequate time to conduct discovery seasonably raised despite lack of affidavit showing need for discovery.). 
The Circuit Court ruled that Phillips's HRCP Rule 56(f)
 
request failed because she had had ample time to conduct
 
discovery and she did not demonstrate that a continuance would
 
have enabled her to demonstrate an issue of material fact. See
 
Wilder, 7 Haw. App. at 253, 753 P.2d at 821 (the request must
 demonstrate how postponement of a ruling on the motion will
 
enable the requestor, by discovery or other means, to rebut the
 
movant's showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists). 
The record supports the Circuit Court's ruling. 
The Complaint was filed on February 4, 2008, eighteen
 
months before the settlement conference upon which Phillips
 
relies as the reason that she suspended discovery. Moreover, two
 
additional months elapsed between the filing of the MSJ and the
 
hearing on the motion. By contrast, the cases cited by Phillips

 Phillips does not claim that the Circuit Court directed the
parties not to conduct discovery.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
deal with very short durations of time between the filing of the 
Complaint and the summary judgment hearing. Crutchfield v. Hart, 
2 Haw. App. 250, 251-52, 630 P.2d 124, 125 (1981) (motion filed less than three months after complaint); Marshall, 9 Haw. App. 
at 29, 821 P.2d at 939, abrogated on other grounds by Hac v. 
Univ. of Hawai
'i, 102 Hawai 'i 92, 73 P.3d 46 (2003) (motion filed 
forty-three days after the complaint). 
As to the need for additional time, the record reflects
 
that multiple reports regarding the condition of the wall and the
 plants in question that had been prepared at the behest of both
 
parties, both before and after the filing of the Complaint, were
 
presented to the court as exhibits to the MSJ. In her memorandum
 
in opposition to the MSJ, Phillips presented another report about
 
the condition of the wall and the plants in question, prepared on
 
November 2, 2009, in the interval between the filing and hearing
 
of the MSJ. Phillips argues that because the November 2, 2009
 
arborist report stated that the roots growing through the wall
 
had "enlarged and grown," she would have benefitted from
 
additional discovery. However, as discussed infra, the observed
 
growth did nothing to demonstrate causation of damages, and
 
Phillips does not otherwise explain how additional time would
 
have enabled her to make this showing.
 
3. The Circuit Court did not err in granting the MSJ 
due to Phillips's failure to show a genuine issue of material 
fact. Phillips's February 2008 Complaint alleged cracks in her 
concrete hollow tile wall and anticipated damage to her house due 
to the roots from the Godbouts' plants, including areca palms, 
dwarf brassaia and Ficus tree planted in 2006 to 2007. 
"[P]rotruding roots constitute a nuisance only when they actually 
cause, or there is imminent danger of them causing, sensible harm 
to property other than plant life[.]" Whitesell v. Houlton, 2 
Haw. App. 365, 367, 632 P.2d 1077, 1079 (1981). An appellate 
court reviews a trial court's grant of summary judgment de novo.

Although a total of five expert reports were submitted­
-some prepared before the Complaint was filed and some prepared 
thereafter--none opined that the Godbouts' plants had already 
caused damage. Phillips cites to her own declaration to 
demonstrate that cracks in the wall were caused by the Godbouts' 
plants.4 However, "[b]are allegations or factually unsupported 
conclusions are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact, and therefore, insufficient to reverse a grant of summary 
judgment[,]" Hous. Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Castle, 79 Hawai
'i 64, 
91, 898 P.2d 576, 603 (1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), and even Phillips does not claim that the cracks 
appeared after the planting of the subject plants, only that she 
noticed them at that time. She does not assert that she could 
see or otherwise determine that these cracks were caused by the 
plant roots. 
The record does contain evidence submitted by Phillips
 
that areca palms, Ficus benjamina and dwarf brassaia were likely
 
to cause damage to the wall in the future, in the five-to-ten­
year time frame. However, evidence was submitted by both parties
 
that, by the time the Circuit Court granted the MSJ, the Godbouts
 
had removed the plants in question. While a November 2, 2009
 
report updating a December 10, 2007 inspection noted that the
 
removed Brassaia's roots were still present and continuing to
 
4 In relevant part, Phillips declared,
 
5. Declarant states she noticed these cracks in the
 
wall after Defendant had planted the earlier plants such as
the Areca Plants, Dwarf Brassaia and Ficus Tree . . . .
 
6. Declarant states that over time, Declarant
observed roots from the type of plants as described above
had protruded into her property through the cracks.
 
7. Declarant states that based on her observations
 
over time, the cracks in the wall appeared to have gotten
larger in size as the roots had grown larger and longer as
well. . . .

grow, it did not note that damage had been caused to the wall by
 
these roots.
 
Therefore, the March 3, 2010 Judgment entered by the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
