Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Vincent's points of error as follows:
 
In all respects relevant to this appeal, HFCR Rule 
24(a)(2) is identical to Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) 
Rule 24(a)(2). Thus, we apply the same standards as those 
applicable to HRCP Rule 24(a)(2). It is well-established that 
intervention as of right requires that: (1) an application for 
intervention be timely filed; (2) the applicant claims an 
interest relating to the property or transaction which is the 
subject of the action; (3) the disposition of the action would, 
as a practical matter, impair or impede the applicant's ability 
to protect that interest; and (3) the applicant's interest is 
inadequately represented by the existing parties. See, e.g., 
Garner v. State, Dept. Of Educ., 122 Hawai' i 150, 165, 223 P.3d 
215, 230 (App. 2009). 
Motions to intervene as of right are reviewed de novo 
under the right/wrong standard. Labayog v. Labayog, 83 Hawai' i 
412, 419-20, 927 P.2d 420, 427-28 (App. 1996). The question of timeliness, however, is left to the sound discretion of the trial 
court. Ing v. Acceptance Ins. Co. 76 Hawai' i 266, 271, 874 P.2d 
1091, 1096 (1994); Garner, 122 Hawai' i at 166, 223 P.3d at 232. 
The court must consider "the totality of the circumstances, 
including the lapse of time between when the proposed intervenor 
should have sought intervention and when it actually did and 
prejudice caused to existing parties by the lapse of time." 
Garner, 122 Hawai' i at 166, 223 P.3d at 231 (citations and 
internal quotation marks omitted). 
Vincent claims an interest as the successor trustee and
 
beneficiary of his mother's trust, which owns a condominium
 apartment in Makaha. This trust was created on April 16, 2008,
 
about one week prior to the filing of the complaint for divorce

herein. Vincent's motion to intervene was "received" by the
 
Family Court on December 14, 2009, more than a year and one half
 
after the complaint for divorce, after the parties to the divorce
 
reached a settlement, but before the divorce decree was entered
 
on December 29, 2009.2
 
Vincent was well-apprised of his parents' divorce 
proceedings from the onset. As Vincent states in his Opening 
Brief, "VINCENT was a participant in the proceedings from the 
filing of the Complaint for Divorce (assisting [his mother] by 
transporting her, interpreting for her, and advising her, in 
addition to being the trustee of her irrevocable trust)". The 
fact that Vincent's role was diminished after a guardian ad litem 
was appointed for his elderly and incapacitated mother did not 
negate his knowledge of the divorce action. The relevant date 
with respect to timeliness of intervention is "when the proposed 
intervenor 'knew or reasonably should have known of its interest' 
in the action." Garner, 122 Hawai' i at 166-67, 223 P.3d at 232Â­
33 (citation omitted). Clearly Vincent knew or should have known 
of his interest long before he filed his motion and only sought 
to intervene after he learned of the settlement and concluded 
that the agreement was potentially unfavorable to him. Under the 
circumstances of this case, we conclude that the Family Court did 
not abuse its discretion when it determined that Vincent's motion 
to intervene was untimely. As the requirements of intervention 
as a matter of right are stated in the conjunctive, we need not 
determine whether Vincent met the other requirements.

 Although received on December 14, 2009, the motion to intervene
was not "filed" by the Family Court until January 13, 2010.

Accordingly, the Family Court's March 3, 2010 Order
 
Denying Intervention is affirmed.
