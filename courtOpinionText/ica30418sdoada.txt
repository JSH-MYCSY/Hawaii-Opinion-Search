(CRIMINAL NO. 09-1-0043(3))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Terrence D. Palmer (Palmer) appeals
 
from the Judgment filed on February 9, 2010, in the Circuit Court
 
1
of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).  After a jury trial,
 
Palmer was found guilty of the following offenses: Unlawful
 
Imprisonment in the First Degree (
Imprisonment 1) (Count 1);2
 
Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree (TT1) (Count 2);3

 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.

 Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 707-721 (Supp. 2010) provides, in
relevant part: "A person commits the offense of unlawful imprisonment in the
first degree if the person knowingly restrains another person undercircumstances which expose the person to the risk of serious bodily injury." 
3
 HRS § 707-716(1)(e) (Supp. 2007) provides: "A person commits the
offense of terroristic threatening in the first degree if the person commits
terroristic threatening . . . [w]ith the use of a dangerous instrument."

Abuse of Family or Household Member (Household Abuse) (Count 3);4
 
and Assault in the Third Degree (Assault 3) (the lesser included
 
offense of Count 4).5 Palmer was sentenced to five years of
 
imprisonment in each of Counts 1 and 2, and one year of
 
imprisonment in each of Counts 3 and 4, with the sentences in
 
Counts 2, 3, and 4 to run concurrently with each other, and Count
 
1 to run consecutively to Counts 2, 3, and 4.
 
On appeal, Palmer argues that: (1) the Circuit Court 
erred in convicting him of Imprisonment 1 because the State of 
Hawai'i (State) failed to present sufficient evidence that he 
restrained the complainant (Complainant) under circumstances 
which exposed her to the risk of serious bodily injury; and (2) 
the Circuit Court plainly erred in failing to give a merger 
6
instruction, pursuant to HRS § 701-109(1)(e),  regarding the
charge of Household Abuse and the charge of Assault in the Second
 
Degree (Assault 2), or the included offense of Assault 3.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
4
 HRS § 709-906 (1993 & Supp. 2010) provides, in relevant part: "It
 
shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in concert, to physically abuse a
family or household member or to refuse compliance with the lawful order of a
police officer[.]"
 
5
 HRS § 707-712(1)(a) (1993) provides: "A person commits the
offense of assault in the third degree if the person . . . [i]ntentionally,
knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to another person[.]"
6
 HRS § 701-109 (1)(e) (1993) provides:
 
§701-109. Method of prosecution when conduct
establishes an element of more than one offense. (1) When
the same conduct of a defendant may establish an element of
more than one offense, the defendant may be prosecuted for
each offense of which such conduct is an element. The
 defendant may not, however, be convicted of more than one
offense if:
 
. . . . 
(e) The offense is defined as a continuing course of
conduct and the defendant's course of conduct was
 uninterrupted, unless the law provides that specific periods
of conduct constitute separate offenses.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Palmer's points of error as follows:
 
(1) We conclude that, viewing the evidence presented
 
at trial in the strongest light for the prosecution, the State
 
adduced sufficient evidence to support a conviction for
 
Imprisonment 1. See HRS §§ 707-721, 702-206(2) (1993), & 707-700
 
(1993). The evidence included, inter alia, testimony that Palmer
 
"restrained," or "restrict[ed]" Complainant's "movement in such a
 
manner as to interfere substantially with" her "liberty . . .
 
[b]y means of force . . . [or] threat," as required under HRS
 
§ 707-700, by touching the knife to the side of Complainant's
 
neck, at her throat. There was substantial evidence that the
 
circumstances "expose[d]" Complainant "to the risk of serious
 
bodily injury," as set forth in HRS § 707-721, including that
 
Palmer's holding the knife against the side of Complainant's neck
 
created a substantial risk of death, § 707-700, especially
 
considering the testimony that he contemporaneously threatened to
 
kill her, and that he had been drinking and flinging a knife,
 
which he then stuck into the kitchen cabinet. Evidence was also
 
adduced that Palmer would not allow Complainant to leave the
 
small master bathroom -- where he pushed her about a dozen times,
 
including at least three times into the wall and once into the
 
bathtub, hurting her side, and whacked her head against a door,
 
causing her to lose one of her porcelain crowns. In addition,
 
the State presented evidence that Palmer had locked and taken the
 
only key to the deadbolt on the front door, refused entry to the
 
police, and called Complainant his "hostage." Accordingly, we
 
conclude that the record contains sufficient evidence that Palmer
 
committed Imprisonment 1.
 
(2) We conclude that the Circuit Court erred by
 
failing to instruct the jury that if it found Palmer guilty of
 
both Household Abuse and Assault 2 or Assault 3, the jury must
 
determine whether the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the offenses did not merge. HRS § 701-109 (1)(e) (1993); 
State v. Matias, 102 Hawai' i 300, 305-06, 75 P.3d 1191, 1196-97 
(2003); State v. Frisbee, 114 Hawai' i 76, 80 & 83, 156 P.3d 1182, 
1186 & 1189 (2007); HRS §§ 707-711(1)(a) (1993 & Supp. 2008), 
707-712(1)(a), & 709-906(1); State v. Padilla, 114 Hawai' i 507, 
517, 164 P.3d 765, 775 (App. 2007). The State concedes that the Circuit Court erred in failing to give a merger instruction and 
has indicated its election that Palmer's Assault 3 conviction be 
dismissed. 
For these reasons, we vacate the Circuit Court's
 
February 9, 2010 Judgment, in part, and remand this case to the
 
Circuit Court for the dismissal of Count 4, with prejudice, and
 
for the entry of an amended judgment and sentence consistent with
 
this summary disposition order. In all other respects, we
 
affirm.
