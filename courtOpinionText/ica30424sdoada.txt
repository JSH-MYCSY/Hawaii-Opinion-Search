IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
EDWIN AKAHI, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 

 (FC-CR NOS. 09-1-0131 and 09-1-0260)
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Edwin Akahi (Akahi) appeals the
 
Judgment of Conviction filed on March 8, 2010 in the Family Court
 
of the Second Circuit (Family Court) that convicted him in
 
consolidated cases of one count of Violation of an Order of
 
Protection in FC-CR No. 09-1-0131, and of one count of Violation
 
of an Order of Protection in FC-CR No. 09-1-0260, both in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 586-11 (2009).1
 
The Family Court sentenced Akahi to, inter alia, two years of
 
probation in each case, with the probation terms to run
 
consecutively.2

 The Honorable Richard T. Bissen, Jr., presided at trial, and the
Honorable Shackley F. Raffetto presided at sentencing.

 Imprisonment for six months was a condition of probation in FC-CR No.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Akahi contends that (1) the sentence is
 
illegal under HRS § 706-629 (1993) and (2) insufficient evidence
 
existed to support the guilty verdicts.
 
The State concedes that the sentence was improper, but
 
asserts that sufficient evidence existed for the convictions.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Akahi's points of error as follows.
 
(1) Sentencing under HRS § 706-629. Akahi contends 
that, contrary to HRS § 706-629, the Family Court sentenced him 
to consecutive, rather than concurrent, probation terms in the 
two underlying cases. "The interpretation of a statute is a 
question of law reviewable de novo." State v. Sumera, 97 Hawai 'i 
430, 436, 39 P.3d 557, 563 (2002) (citation omitted). Despite the State's concession that the Family Court erred in sentencing 
Akahi to two consecutive terms of probation under HRS § 706-629, 
this court must nevertheless determine that the concession is 
sound. State v. Wasson, 76 Hawai
'i 415, 418, 879 P.2d 520, 523 
(1994) (citing Territory v. Kogami, 37 Haw. 174, 175 (Haw. Terr. 1945)) ("even when the prosecutor concedes error, before a 
conviction is reversed, 'it is incumbent on the appellate court 
to ascertain first that the confession of error is supported by 
the record and well-founded in law and to determine that such 
error is properly preserved and prejudicial.'"). 
HRS § 706-629(1)(b) (1993) states:
 
§ 706-629. Calculation of multiple dispositions involving
probation and imprisonment, or multiple terms of probation.
(1) When the disposition of a defendant involves more than one
crime:
 
. . .
 
(b) Multiple periods of probation shall run concurrently
from the date of the first such disposition.
 
. . . .

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court, in Sumera, 97 Hawai 'i at 433­
34, 39 P.3d at 560-61, reviewed HRS § 706-629 in a case where the
 
circuit court sentenced a defendant to two concurrent terms of
 
probation, with two consecutive prison terms as conditions of
 
probation.3 The Hawai 'i Supreme Court concluded, in relevant 
part:
 
The language of HRS § 706-629(1) is clear and unambiguous. It
 
governs when a sentencing "disposition" involves more than one
crime. No qualifications are placed on the scope of this
provision. Thus, the provisions of HRS § 706-629(1) apply to all
crimes for which sentencing is imposed at the same time, whether
the crimes are charged in the same case or in different cases, and
regardless of when such cases were filed or tried.
 
Sumera, 97 Hawai 'i at 436, 39 P.3d at 563. The Sumera court went 
on to state:
 
The rationale for running probation sentences concurrently
rather than consecutively is that lengthy probation terms are
inappropriate if a sentence to the maximum term of imprisonment
has been rejected:
 
If imprisonment is not warranted, there hardly seems
 
any justification for providing elongated periods of
 ... probation when the disposition of the defendant
 involves more than one offense or when a defendant
 
already under suspension of sentence or on probation,
is convicted for a crime committed prior to the former
disposition.
 
Sumera, 97 Hawai 'i at 438, 39 P.3d at 565 (citation omitted). 
The Hawai 'i Supreme Court concluded, inter alia, that "[u]nder 
HRS § 706-629, sentences of probation must run concurrently." 
Sumera, 97 Hawai 'i at 439, 39 P.3d at 566. 
Accordingly, the Family Court erred in sentencing Akahi
 
to consecutive terms of probation, and the State's concession in
 
this regard is well taken.
 
3 As the Hawai' i Supreme Court noted, in such circumstances "probation
is the sentence, and the requirement that a defendant serve a term of
imprisonment is simply a condition of probation." Sumera, 97 Hawai' i at 435,
39 P.3d at 562.

(2) Sufficiency of the evidence. Akahi contends that
 
insufficient evidence existed to support the convictions and
 
denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal for the offenses
 
occurring on March 22, 2009 and on June 29, 2009. Sufficiency of
 
the evidence is "considered in the strongest light for the
 
prosecution" to determine "not whether guilt is established
 
beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial
 
evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact." State
 
v. Richie, 88 Hawai 'i 19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) (quoting 
State v. Quitog, 85 Hawai 'i 128, 145, 938 P.2d 559, 576 (1997)). 
"The testimony of a single witness, if found credible by the trier of fact, may constitute substantial evidence to support a 
conviction." State v. Montgomery, 103 Hawai
'i 373, 381, 82 P.3d 
818, 826 (App. 2003) (citation omitted). A jury may infer a defendant's state of mind from the circumstances surrounding the 
defendant's conduct. State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai
'i 131, 141, 913 
P.2d 57, 67 (1996) (citation omitted). "Matters of credibility and the weight of the evidence and the inferences to be drawn are 
for the fact finder." State v. Romano, 114 Hawai
'i 1, 8, 155 
P.3d 1102, 1109 (2007). 
In the instant case, the following evidence was
 
presented. On February 26, 2009, Marie Dela Nux (Dela Nux), a
 TRO advocate at Women Helping Women appeared at a hearing with
 
Candyce Gonsales (Gonsales). Akahi was present at the hearing. 
At the conclusion of the hearing, Dela Nux served the order of
 
protection on Akahi. Both the respondent, Akahi, and petitioner,
 
Gonsales, signed a document acknowledging that they received the
 
order of protection. The acknowledgment was received in
 
evidence. Dela Nux witnessed Akahi sign the receipt for the
 
order of protection. The order of protection that was entered
 
into evidence was filed on February 26, 2009 and expires on
 
February 25, 2019; identifies Gonsales as the petitioner and
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Akahi as the respondent; and orders that Akahi, inter alia, "not
 
contact, write, telephone . . . the Petitioner, including where
 
Petitioner lives or works."
 
Gonsales attended the February 26, 2009 hearing, where
 
she was the petitioner, and Akahi was the respondent. Gonsales
 
saw that Akahi was present at the hearing. Gonsales identified
 
the order of protection.
 
On March 22, 2009, Gonsales was working and at about
 
6:40 p.m., Gonsales answered the phone. Gonsales testified that
 
"Edwin called my work." When asked how she knew it was Akahi
 
calling, Gonsales responded "[b]ecause I know his voice." 
Gonsales testified she had been in a relationship with Akahi in
 
"2004, 2005" but had known him since she was fourteen years old. 
Gonsales further testified that Akahi, who "was angry[,]" said,
 
"[a]re you finished getting fucking stupid?" Gonsales reported
 
the incident to the police, and was later informed by the
 
Prosecutor's Office about the trial date.
 
On June 29, 2009, Gonsales was at work and received a
 
call about 12:27 p.m. Gonsales stated that she "answered the
 
phone and -- and it was Eddie again and he said, 'watch what will
 
happen when I show up at court.'" The Family Court took judicial
 
notice of the fact that Akahi was ordered to appear in court in
 
FC-CR No. 09-1-0131(4) for a pretrial conference on July 1, 2009
 
and for trial on July 20, 2009. Gonsales also testified that
 
Akahi "was angry." Gonsales again reported the incident to the
 
police.
 
The foregoing evidence, viewed in the strongest light for
 
the prosecution, was sufficient to support the convictions. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT we vacate that part of the
 
Judgment of Conviction filed on March 8, 2010 in the Family Court
 
of the Second Circuit that requires the probation terms in FC-CR
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
No. 09-1-0131 and FC-CR No. 09-1-0260 to run consecutively, and
 
we remand for entry of an amended judgment consistent with this
 
decision. In all other respects, we affirm the Judgment of
 
Conviction filed on March 8, 2010.
