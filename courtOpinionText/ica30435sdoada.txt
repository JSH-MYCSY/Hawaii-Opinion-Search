IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
IN THE INTEREST OF MM, MINOR
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 08-00693)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
Appellant Mother (Mother) and Cross-Appellant Father
 
(Father) (collectively, parents) appeal from the Decision and
 
Order Terminating the Parental Rights of [Father] and [Mother]
 
and Awarding Permanent Custody filed on March 15, 2010 in the
 
Family Court of the Fifth Circuit (family court).1
 
On appeal, Mother contends her service plan did not
 
include treatment for her mental illness, which she characterizes
 
as "attention deficit, schizotypal personality disorder, and
 
paranoid personality disorder," and therefore the plan was
 
insufficient to provide a reasonable opportunity to Mother and
 
Father to reunify the family. Mother also contends that because
 
she was not treated for her mental illness, there is not clear
 
and convincing evidence that, with appropriate treatment, she

would not have been able to provide a safe home for her child,
 
MM.
 
On appeal, Father contends the family court erred by 
finding that he was unwilling and unable to provide a safe family 
home for MM because the court's finding was based on the failure 
of the State of Hawai 'i Department of Human Services (DHS) to 
provide him with a reasonable opportunity to become a safe parent. Father also contends DHS failed to provide him with 
treatment for his Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), did not 
refer him to a community mental health setting on another island, 
and did not attempt a hanai arrangement or other form of legal 
guardianship. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 
appeal is without merit.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Decision and Order
 
Terminating the Parental Rights of [Father] and [Mother] and
 Awarding Permanent Custody filed on March 15, 2010 in the Family
 
Court of the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.
