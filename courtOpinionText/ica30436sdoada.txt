OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JARED K. MATSUNAMI, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAHIAWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-09-03979)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Jared K. Matsunami (Matsunami)
 
appeals from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment, entered on January 21, 2010 in the District Court
 
of the First Circuit, Wahiaw a Division (District Court).1
 
Matsunami was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in
 
violation of HRS § 291C-105(a)(1) and (a)(2) (2007 Repl.).
 
On appeal, Matsunami contends: (1) the District Court 
erred in admitting a speed check card because the State failed to 
establish the requisite foundation for admissibility of the speed 
check card, as required by State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai 'i 354, 
227 P.3d 520 (2010); (2) the District Court erred in concluding

that the State established sufficient foundation for the
 
reliability of the speed check card; (3) absent the speed check
 
card, there was insufficient evidence to convict him of Excessive
 
Speeding; and (4) admission of the speed check card violated his
 
right of confrontation.
 
The State concedes that there was insufficient
 
foundation to admit the speed check card into evidence under
 
Fitzwater, and, therefore, insufficient evidence to convict
 
Matsunami of Excessive Speeding. However, the State argues that
 
the case should be remanded to the District Court for entry of a
 
judgment against Matsunami for violating HRS § 291C-102(a)(1)
 
(2007 Repl.), a non-criminal traffic violation of speeding. The
 
State points to Matsunami's testimony that he accelerated to
 
seventy to seventy-five miles per hour. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Matsunami's points of error and the State's argument as
 
to HRS § 291C-102(a)(1) (regular speeding) as follows:
 
(1) The State failed to establish how the speed check 
was performed, including whether it was performed in the manner 
specified by the manufacturer of the equipment used to perform 
the check and the identity and qualifications of the person 
performing the check. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai 'i at 376-77, 227 P.3d 
at 542-43. Therefore, there was insufficient foundation to admit the speed check card into evidence. Without admission of the 
speed check card into evidence, there was insufficient evidence 
to convict Matsunami of Excessive Speeding. We therefore need 
not address Matsunami's claim that admission of the speed check 
card violated his right to confrontation. 
(2) With regard to the State's assertion that we should
 
remand to the District Court for entry of a judgment against

Matsunami for regular speeding under HRS § 291C-102(a)(1), we 
first consider whether the erroneous admission of the speed check 
card was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as to the lesser 
included infraction of regular speeding. State v. Bullard, 124 
Hawai'i 270, 241 P.3d 562 (App. 2010). In this case, the 
properly admitted evidence showed that the speed limit was fifty-
five miles per hour and Matsunami testified that he accelerated 
to between seventy and seventy-five miles per hour. Therefore, 
admission of the speed check card was harmless beyond a 
reasonable doubt with respect to the lesser included regular 
speeding infraction, and there was sufficient evidence to 
establish that Matsunami was speeding. See Bullard, 124 Hawai 'i 
at 278, 241 P.3d at 570; Fitzwater, 122 Hawai 'i at 378, 227 P.3d 
at 544. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment, entered on January 21,
 2010 in the District Court of the First Circuit, Wahiaw
a
 
Division, is vacated and the case is remanded with instructions
 to enter a judgment that Matsunami violated HRS § 291C-102(a)(1).
