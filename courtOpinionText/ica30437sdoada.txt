STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
BARRY McCORKLE, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CR. NO. 1P109-7267)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Barry McCorkle (McCorkle) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order (Judgment),
 
entered on December 28, 2009, in the District Court of the First
 
Circuit (district court).1 The district court convicted McCorkle
 
of violating Sec. 40-1.2 of the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu
 (ROH), entitled "Prohibition in public areas -- Exceptions"
 
2
(Prohibition),  and sentenced him to pay a $100 fine and $30 CICF
fee.

 The Honorable Clarence A. Pacarro presided.

 ROH ยง 40-1.2(a) provides that "[n]o person shall possess, other than
in a container in the manufacturer's sealed condition, intoxicating liquor on
any street or sidewalk, or in any public park, public playground, public
school ground, public off-street parking area or any building located
thereon."
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, McCorkle argues that (1) the district court 
erred in convicting him of Prohibition because the ordinance is 
unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and (2) the court 
reversibly erred in convicting him where Appellee State of 
Hawai'i (State) failed to prove that none of the exceptions 
listed in ROH Sec. 40-1.2 applied. McCorkle asks that we reverse his conviction. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve McCorkle's points of error as follows.
 
McCorkle fails to indicate, and the record does not 
reflect, that while the case was before the district court he 
challenged the constitutionality of ROH Sec. 40-1.2 in any 
manner, or that he argued that the State was required to prove 
that the exceptions in ROH Sec. 40-1.2 did not apply. See Rule 
28(b)(4) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
"Generally, the failure to properly raise an issue at the
trial level precludes a party from raising that issue on
appeal." State v. Hoglund, 71 Haw. 147, 150, 785 P.2d 1311,
 
1313 (1990) (citing State v. Cummings, 49 Haw. 522, 423 P.2d
438 (1967)). Specifically, this court has held that
 
the question of the constitutionality of a statute
cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. State
 v. Tin Yan, 44 Haw. 370, 355 P.2d 25 (1960). However,
in cases where we have considered the
 constitutionality of a statute raised for the first
time on appeal, we have done so on the ground that the
constitutionality of the statute is of great public
import and justice required that we consider the
issue. See, e.g., Fujioka v. Kam, 55 Haw. 7, 514 P.2d
 
568 (1973); Smith v. Smith, 56 Haw. 295, 535 P.2d 1109
(1975).
 
State v. Ildefonso, 72 Haw. 573, 584, 827 P.2d 648, 655
(1992).
 
[I]n the exercise of this discretion[,] an appellate
court should determine whether the consideration of
 the issue requires additional facts, whether the
resolution of the question will affect the integrity
of the findings of fact of the trial court[,] and
whether the question is of great public import.

State v. Kapela, 82 Hawai' i 381, 392 n. 4, 922 P.2d 994,
1005 n.4 (App.1996) (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted) (first set of brackets in original). 
State v. Hicks, 113 Hawai' i 60, 74, 148 P.3d 493, 507 (2006). 
Neither party has addressed the question regarding
 
McCorkle's waiver of his points of error. We conclude at the
 
outset that McCorkle has waived, and we need not address, his
 
challenge that the State failed to prove that the exceptions in
 
ROH Sec. 40-1.2 did not apply. This issue is not based on a
 
constitutional challenge to the ordinance and has clearly been
 
waived.
 
As to McCorkle's challenge that the ordinance is
 
unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, our review of the record
 
convinces us that justice does not require that we consider these
 
constitutional challenges that McCorkle failed to raise below. 
Especially as to the question of whether the ordinance is
 
overbroad, the record is simply not developed sufficiently for us
 
to review the issue. McCorkle argues that ROH Sec. 40-1.2 "is
 
unconstitutionally [overbroad] as applied to McCorkle where it
 
infringed upon his constitutional rights to freedom of movement,
 
association and privacy." However, because the issue was not
 
raised below, there is no evidence or testimony by McCorkle
 
regarding how his alleged rights were infringed upon or to
 
provide any factual context to his constitutional challenge.
 
Moreover, McCorkle has the burden of showing the
 
alleged unconstitutionality of the ordinance beyond a reasonable
 
doubt. 
[W]here it is alleged that the legislature has acted
unconstitutionally, this court has consistently held that
every enactment of the legislature is presumptively
constitutional, and a party challenging the statute [or
ordinance] has the burden of showing unconstitutionality
beyond a reasonable doubt. The infraction should be plain,
clear, manifest, and unmistakeable.

State v. Kamal, 88 Hawai' i 292, 294, 966 P.2d 604, 606 (1998) 
(first bracket added and citation omitted). McCorkle has failed 
to make such a showing and we find no merit based on this appeal. 
See Hicks, 113 Hawai' i at 75, 148 P.3d at 508. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order, entered on December 28, 2009, in the
 District Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
