IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CHRIS F. YAMAMOTO, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
'EWA DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-09-04944)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Chris F. Yamamoto (Yamamoto)
 
appeals the February 2, 2010 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or
 
Order and Plea/Judgment filed in the District Court of the First
 
1
Circuit, ' Ewa Division (District Court)  convicting him of
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII), 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1)(3) 
and (b)(1)(2) (Supp. 2009). 
On November 12, 2009, a complaint was filed (First 
Complaint) that asserted an OVUII offense against Yamamoto, but 
failed to include the allegation that the offense occurred on a 
"public way, street, road or highway" as required pursuant to 
State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 393, 219 P.3d 1170, 1180 
(2009). Wheeler was issued on November 17, 2009, five days after

the First Complaint was filed. The record does not reflect that
 
the First Complaint was served on Yamamoto.
 
2
On November 25, 2009,  at the first hearing in the
case, the First Complaint was withdrawn and another complaint was
 
filed (Second Complaint) that included the 
Wheeler "public way,
 
street, road or highway" language. Yamamoto was charged with
 Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII),
 
in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3), and subjecting
 
him to sentencing under HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) and/or (b)(2). The
 
Second Complaint was served in open court at the November 25,
 
2009 hearing, and the arraignment, plea, and trial were
 
continued.
 
On February 2, 2010, the date of trial, Yamamoto made
 
an oral motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter
 
jurisdiction, arguing that no subject matter jurisdiction existed
 
on the Second Complaint because it attempted to amend a defective
 
complaint for which no jurisdiction existed in the first instance
 
(First Motion to Dismiss). The State argued that the defective
 
complaint was never served, and where the second complaint was
 
filed and served, the second complaint initiated the case. The
 
District Court denied Yamamoto's First Motion to Dismiss. The
 
State orally arraigned Yamamoto on the Second Complaint. 
Yamamoto then orally moved to dismiss the charge because it
 
"failed to allege the requisite mens rea element" where "the
 
state must prove that this offense happened either intentionally,
 
knowingly, or at least recklessly" (Second Motion to Dismiss). 
The District Court denied the Second Motion to Dismiss,
 
whereafter a stipulated facts trial ensued. The District Court
 
found Yamamoto guilty and entered a judgment of conviction

against Yamamoto for OVUII, under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1)(3) and
 
(b)(1)(2). This timely appeal followed.
 
On appeal, Yamamoto contends that the District Court
 
erred: (1) in permitting the filing of the Second Complaint and
 
denying the First Motion to Dismiss because the First Complaint
 
was defective for failing to state that the offense occurred on a
 
"public way, street, road or highway," thus depriving the
 
District Court of jurisdiction; and (2) in denying the Second
 
Motion to Dismiss and in consequently convicting Yamamoto because
 
the amended charge was defective for failing to specify the
 
applicable state of mind, depriving the District Court of
 
jurisdiction.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Yamamoto's points of error as follows.
 
I.	 The District Court Did Not Err in Denying the First Motion
to Dismiss.
 
In asserting his first point of error, Yamamoto
 
contends that: (a) the District Court did not have subject matter
 
jurisdiction because the First Complaint did not confer
 
jurisdiction, (b) permitting filing of the Second Complaint was
 
tantamount to an amended complaint and did not cure the lack of
 
jurisdiction, and (c) the District Court should have dismissed
 
the case, so that a new complaint could be filed in a new case. 
We review such questions regarding jurisdiction de novo. State
 
v. Cummings, 101 Hawai' i 139, 142, 145, 63 P.3d 1109, 1112, 1115 
(2003); Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 390, 219 P.3d at 1177. 
In charging the OVUII offense, if a complaint fails to 
"allege that [defendant] was driving his vehicle upon a public 
way, street, road, or highway[,]" the charge is deficient. 
Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Cummings, the prosecution proceeded on a driving 
under the influence (DUI) case that was initiated with a 
defective complaint, and the district court permitted the 
prosecution to "amend" the complaint after conclusion of its 
case-in-chief. Under the facts of that case, the Hawai' i Supreme 
Court determined that the amendment of the complaint could not confer jurisdiction retroactively because absent a proper 
complaint, the prosecution's case-in-chief was a legal nullity. 
Cummings, 101 Hawai' i at 145, 63 P.3d at 1115. The Cummings 
court also stated that because the amendment in that case "stated an offense for the first time[,]" "[Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure] HRPP Rule 7(f)
[3] is inapplicable . . . and the 
question of prejudice is irrelevant." Id. 
In the instant case, the First Complaint failed to 
allege the Wheeler "public way" language and thus was defective, 
as the State admits. However, the First Complaint was withdrawn, 
and the Second Complaint that included the Wheeler public way 
language was filed and served on November 25, 2009 at the initial 
hearing in this case. This situation is significantly different 
than in Cummings. In Cummings, no valid charge existed until 
after the prosecution's evidence had been presented in its case­
in-chief. Cummings, 101 Hawai' i at 145, 63 P.3d at 1115. In 
3 At the time of Cummings, HRPP Rule 7(f)(2001) stated:
 
(f) Amendment.  The court may permit a charge other than an
indictment to be amended at any time before verdict or finding if
no additional or different offense is charged and if substantial
rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.
 
On November 25, 2009, the date of withdrawal of the First Complaint and
filing of the Second Complaint in the instant case, HRPP Rule 7(f) stated: 
(f) Amendment.
 (1) The court may permit a charge other than an indictment
to be amended at any time before trial commences if substantial
rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.
(2) The court may permit a charge other than an indictment
to be amended after trial commences and before verdict or finding
if the defendant personally, knowingly, and voluntarily agrees to
the amendment on the record.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
such a situation, a conviction could not be based on evidence 
that the court had no jurisdiction to hear, because "the amended 
complaint could not confer jurisdiction retroactively." 
Cummings, 101 Hawai' i at 145, 63 P.3d at 1115. Here, as 
distinguished from Cummings, the First Complaint was not served on Yamamoto and the Second Complaint was served at the initial 
court hearing and before any presentation of evidence. Under 
these circumstances, it was not error for the District Court to 
permit the filing of the Second Complaint in the same case, 
particularly where the action achieved the same result as 
dismissing and refiling, and where Yamamoto was provided ample 
time to prepare for trial and suffered no prejudice. 
II.	 The District Court did not Err in Denying the Second Motion
to Dismiss.
 
Yamamoto argues that the District Court erred in
 
denying his Second Motion to Dismiss because the failure to
 
specify the requisite state of mind, required as an essential
 
fact pursuant to HRPP Rule 7(d), renders the Second Complaint
 
defective. Yamamoto was charged in the Second Complaint with
 
violating HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3).

A.	 State of Mind under HRS § 291E-61.
 
4 HRS § 291E-61(a) (Supp. 2009) stated:
 
Operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant.  (a) A
person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes
actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
 sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty;
 
(2)	 While under the influence of any drug that impairs the
person's ability to operate the vehicle in a careful
and prudent manner;
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath; or
 
(4)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred
milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood.

1.	 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) (breath alcohol content)
provides for absolute liability.
 
As to the state of mind requirement for Yamamoto's
 
charge under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), OVUII determined by alcohol
 
content is an absolute liability offense. State v. Young, 8 Haw.
 
5
App. 145, 153-154, 795 P.2d 285, 291 (1990) ; see also H. Stand.
Comm. Rep. No. 591, in 1983 House Journal, at 1105; S. Stand.
 
Comm. Rep. No. 999, in 1983 Senate Journal, at 1478. 
The state of mind requirements of HRS § 702-204 do not
 
apply to a crime outside the penal code where a legislative
 
purpose to impose absolute liability plainly appears, and no
 
state of mind is required in the charge. HRS § 702-212; see
 
HRS § 701-102(3) (1993) ("[t]he provisions of chapters 701
 
through 706 of the [Penal] Code are applicable to offenses
 
defined by other statutes, unless the Code otherwise provides"
 
(emphasis and brackets added)); see also State v. Kane, 3 Haw.
 
App. 450, 453-54, 652 P.2d 642, 645 (1982).
 
2.	 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (impairment by alcohol)
requires an intentional, knowing, or reckless
state of mind.
 
Although OVUII under subsection (a)(3) (breath alcohol
 
content) is an absolute liability offense, OVUII under subsection
 
(a)(1), which requires a showing of impairment, does not reflect
 
the same legislative intent to create an absolute liability
 
offense. Consequently, the state of mind requirements of
 
HRS § 702-204 apply to OVUII under subsection (a)(1). 
HRS § 701-102(3); see also HRS § 701-102 cmt. (making state of
 
mind requirements applicable to non-Penal-Code statutory
 
offenses). Thus, as no state of mind is specified in
 
5
 HRS § 291-4, which was the statute at issue in Young, was recodified 
and reenacted as HRS § 291E-61. See State v. Anger, 105 Hawai' i 423, 425 n.2,
98 P.3d 630, 632 n.2 (2004). 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), the state of mind of intentionally,
 
knowingly, or recklessly would apply.
 
B. State of Mind in the Charge.
 
Irrespective of the state of mind to be proved under 
any subsection of OVUII, whether that state of mind must be 
alleged in the charging document is a separate matter. The issue 
of whether a charge contains all essential elements of the 
offense is reviewed de novo. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 390, 219 
P.3d at 1177. 
The Wheeler court analyzed a district court case for 
sufficiency of the charge and stated that "an accusation must 
sufficiently allege all of the essential elements of the offense 
charged, a requirement that obtains whether an accusation is in 
the nature of an oral charge, information, indictment, or 
complaint." Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178 
(citation omitted, emphasis added, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Wheeler also referenced HRS § 702-205, which 
specifies the elements of the offense as the conduct, attendant circumstances, and results of conduct. 121 Hawai' i at 391-92, 
219 P.3d at 1178-79. As determined in State v. Klinge, 92 Hawai'i 577, 584 n.3, 994 P.2d 509, 516 n.3 (2000), "under HRS 
§ 702-205, state of mind is not an 'element' of a criminal offense." Nevertheless, state of mind must be proved. See HRS 
§§ 701-102(3) and 702-204. 
Contrary to Yamamoto's claim that state of mind is
 
required in the charge as part of the "essential facts" mandated 
7
    
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
6
in HRPP Rule 7(d),  "[i]n general, where the statute sets forth
with reasonable clarity all essential elements of the crime 
intended to be punished, and fully defines the offense in 
unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common 
understanding, a charge drawn in the language of the statute is 
sufficient." State v. Mita, 124 Hawai' i 385, 392, 245 P.3d 458, 
465 (2010) (quoting Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 393, 219 P.3d at 
1180) (emphasis and some brackets added; internal quotation marks and some brackets omitted) (referencing the "plain, concise and 
definite statement of essential facts" requirement of HRPP Rule 
7(d)). 
As noted, the language of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) does not 
specify the applicable state of mind required for conviction. 
Looking to the language of the statute in analyzing the 
sufficiency of a charge can be a determinative factor, and even 
though the provisions of HRS § 806-28 are not applicable to 
district court proceedings, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has 
similarly relied on the language of the particular criminal statute to determine if state of mind needed to be specified in a 
charge in district court proceedings. See State v. Yonaha, 68 
Haw. 586, 586, 723 P.2d 185, 185-186 (1986); State v. Faulkner, 61 Haw. 177, 178, 599 P.2d 285, 286 (1979); State v. Jendrusch, 
58 Haw. 279, 281-282, 567 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1977).
7 
6 HRPP Rule 7(d) states, in part:
 
(d) Nature and Contents.  The charge shall be a plain, concise and
definite statement of the essential facts constituting the offense
charged. . . . Formal defects, including erroneous reference to
the statute, rule, regulation or other provision of law, or the
omission of such reference, shall not be ground for dismissal of
the charge or for reversal of a conviction if the defect did not
prejudice the defendant.
7
 Although these cases refer to state of mind as an "element," these
cases preceded State v. Klinge, 92 Hawai' i at 584 n.3, 994 P.2d at 516 n.3,
which clarified that state of mind is not an essential element of an offense. 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Further, in a charge of OVUII under HRS § 291E­
8
61(a)(1), a general intent crime,  the state of mind can be
inferred without specification in the charge.9 Consequently, the
 
charge against Yamamoto of OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) does
 not require specification of the state of mind. 
Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying
 
Yamamoto's Second Motion to Dismiss and in convicting Yamamoto
 
based upon the Second Complaint. 
Therefore, the District Court's February 2, 2010 Notice
 
of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment is affirmed.
