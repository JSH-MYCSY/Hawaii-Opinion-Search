v.
 
RICHARD LIONHEART, Respondent-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
HAMAKUA DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 3SS10-1-004H)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Respondent-Appellant Richard Lionheart (Lionheart)
 
appeals from the Order Granting Petition for Injunction Against
 
Harassment filed on March 18, 2010 in the District Court of the
 
Third Circuit, Hamakua Division (district court).1
 
On appeal, Lionheart contends the district court erred
 
(1) by denying his request to continue an evidentiary hearing and
 
(2) by finding there was clear and convincing evidence to
 
establish the allegations in the Petition for Injunction Against
 
Harassment.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
1
 The Honorable Melvin H. Fujino presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Lionheart's points of error are without merit.
 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Granting Petition
 
for Injunction Against Harassment filed on March 18, 2010 in the
 District Court of the Third Circuit, Hamakua Division, is
 
affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 22, 2011.
