Defendants-Appellants Charter School Review Panel
 
(Panel), Charter School Administrative Office (CSAO), Board of
 
Education of the State of Hawai
'i (BOE), and Department of FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Education of the State of Hawai' i (DOE) (collectively, 
Defendants) appeal from the Final Judgment filed on March 18, 
1
2010 in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit  (circuit court). 
The circuit court entered the Final Judgment in accordance with
 
its "Memorandum of Decision, Order, and Judgment" filed on
 
July 31, 2009. The circuit court entered judgment in favor of
 
Plaintiffs-Appellees Waters of Life Local School Board (Waters of
 
Life Board); Waters of Life Public Charter School (Waters of Life
 
School); Rudolph Webster, Carrie Russ, and Rose Torres (Waters of
 
Life School Parents) (collectively, Plaintiffs) and against
 
Defendants on all of Plaintiffs' claims.
 
On appeal, Defendants contend the circuit court erred
 
when it
 
(1) did not dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint for
 
injunctive relief for lack of jurisdiction and erroneously found
 
that Waters of Life Board was an entity separate and apart from
 
Waters of Life School and, as a separate entity, was not
 
precluded under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 302B-9(d) (2007
 
Repl.) from bringing action for such relief;
 
(2) failed to find that Plaintiffs had not exhausted
 
their administrative remedies;
 
(3) failed to find that Waters of Life School Parents
 
did not have a private right of action; and
 
(4) failed to find that Waters of Life School Parents
 
did not have standing before the circuit court to bring the
 
underlying case.

HRS Chapter 302B, titled Public Charter Schools,

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On May 2, 2008, in response to concerns about Waters of
 
Life School, Panel held proceedings related to the operational
 
viability of the school. On June 12, 2008, pursuant to its
 
authority under HRS § 302B-14(d)(5) & (6) (2007 Repl.), Panel
 
placed Waters of Life School on probationary status for one year
 
for alleged deficiencies related to facility health and safety
 
issues, fiscal management, and its detailed implementation plan. 
At the end of the probationary period, Panel conducted a hearing
 
on June 18, 2009 and subsequently revoked Waters of Life School's
 
charter.2
 
On June 23, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a complaint for
 
declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and appointment of a
 
receiver. On June 25, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a "Motion for
 
Temporary Injunctive Relief and Appointment of a Receiver"
 
(Motion for Injunctive Relief). On July 8, 2009, Defendants
 
filed a "Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for
 
Summary Judgment on Complaint Filed on June 23, 2009" (Motion to
 
Dismiss).
 
On July 15, 2009, the circuit court heard arguments on
 
Plaintiffs' Motion for Injunctive Relief. At the hearing, after
 
the circuit court stated it would issue a preliminary injunction,
 
the parties stipulated to a permanent injunction to expedite the
 
appeals process. On July 31, 2009, the circuit court issued its
 
"Memorandum of Decision, Order, and Judgment." Defendants
 
withdrew their Motion to Dismiss on August 3, 2009.
 
On August 28, 2009, Defendants filed a notice of
 
appeal, which appeal this court dismissed on December 23, 2009
 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction because no final judgment had
 
been entered. On March 18, 2010, the circuit court entered its
 
Final Judgment. Defendants timely filed their notice of appeal.

II.
 
A. Standing
 
"Whether the circuit court has jurisdiction to hear the 
plaintiffs' complaint presents a question of law, reviewable de 
novo. A plaintiff without standing is not entitled to invoke a 
court's jurisdiction. Thus, the issue of standing is reviewed de 
novo on appeal." Right to Know Comm. v. City Council, City & 
County of Honolulu, 117 Hawai' i 1, 7, 175 P.3d 111, 117 (App. 
2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction
 
The existence of jurisdiction is a question of law
that we review de novo under the right/wrong standard.
Questions regarding subject matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any stage of a cause of action. When reviewing a
case where the circuit court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction, the appellate court retains jurisdiction, not
on the merits, but for the purpose of correcting the error
in jurisdiction. A judgment rendered by a circuit court
without subject matter jurisdiction is void.
 
Lingle v. Hawai' i Gov't Employees Ass'n, AFSCME, Local 152, AFL­
CIO, 107 Hawai' i 178, 182, 111 P.3d 587, 591 (2005) (quoting 
Amantiad v. Odum, 90 Hawai' i 152, 158-59, 977 P.2d 160, 166-67 
(1999)). 
C. Statutory Interpretation
 
Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law
to be reviewed de novo under the right/wrong standard.
 
Our statutory construction is guided by the following
well established principles:
 
our foremost obligation is to ascertain and give
effect to the intention of the legislature, which is
to be obtained primarily from the language contained
in the statute itself. And we must read statutory
language in the context of the entire statute and
construe it in a manner consistent with its purpose.
 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used
in a statute, an ambiguity exists.
 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning
of the ambiguous words may be sought by examining the
context, with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and
sentences may be compared, in order to ascertain their
true meaning. Moreover, the courts may resort to
extrinsic aids in determining legislative intent. One
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
avenue is the use of legislative history as an
interpretive tool.
 
[The appellate] court may also consider the
reason and spirit of the law, and the cause which
induced the legislature to enact it to discover its
true meaning.
 
Lingle, 107 Hawai' i at 183, 111 P.3d at 592 (internal quotation 
marks, brackets in original, and ellipses omitted) (quoting Guth 
v. Freeland, 96 Hawai' i 147, 149–50, 28 P.3d 982, 984–85 (2001)). 
D. Injunctive Relief
 
Generally, the granting or denying of injunctive
relief rests with the sound discretion of the trial court
 
and the trial court's decision will be sustained absent a
 showing of a manifest abuse of discretion. Abuse of
 discretion may be found where the trial court lacked
jurisdiction to grant the relief, or where the trial court
based its decision on an unsound proposition of law. 
Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp. of State of Hawaii, 120 Hawai' i 
181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 1242 (2009) (quoting Hawai' i Pub. 
Employment Relations Bd. v. United Pub. Workers, Local 646, 
AFSCME, AFL-CIO, 66 Haw. 461, 467-68, 667 P.2d 783, 788 (1983)). 
III.
 
HRS § 302B-9(d) precludes Waters of Life School and 
Waters of Life Board from bringing suit against any entity or 
agency of the State of Hawai' i (State), and therefore the circuit 
court erred when it did not dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint for lack of jurisdiction. 
At the hearing on the Motion for Injunctive Relief,
 
Defendants argued that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction
 
because Plaintiffs lacked standing to sue Defendants pursuant to
 
HRS § 302B-9 (2007 Repl.), which provides that "as public schools
 
and entities of the State, neither a charter school nor the
 
office may bring suit against any other entity or agency of the
 
State." The circuit court rejected Defendants' argument, finding
 
in the Memorandum of Decision, Order and Judgment that Waters of
 
Life Board was "an entity separate and apart from [Waters of Life
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
School] and not precluded by HRS § 302B-9 from bringing the
 
present lawsuit."3
 
A party must have standing in order to bring a lawsuit 
in court. Hanabusa v. Lingle, 119 Hawai' i 341, 347, 198 P.3d 
604, 610 (2008). If a party lacks standing, "the court is without subject matter jurisdiction to determine the action. 
Thus, if a court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of a 
proceeding, any judgment rendered in that proceeding is invalid." 
Hawaii Med. Ass'n v. Hawaii Med. Serv. Ass'n, Inc., 113 Hawai' i 
77, 94, 148 P.3d 1179, 1196 (2006) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
The question before us is whether the Hawai' i 
legislature intended to include Waters of Life Board in the 
meaning of "charter schools" when it enacted HRS § 302B-9(d), 
which prohibits charter schools from suing other entities or 
agencies of the State. "[W]e must read statutory language in the 
context of the entire statute and construe it in a manner 
consistent with its purpose," and also look to the legislative 
history and "consider the reason and spirit of the law." Lingle, 
107 Hawai' i at 183, 111 P.3d at 592 (quoting Guth, 96 Hawai' i at 
150, 28 P.3d at 985). 
Based on the following review of the applicable 
sections of the Hawai' i Constitution, HRS, and the legislative 
history of HRS Chapter 302B, we conclude that Waters of Life Board and Waters of Life School are both governed by HRS § 302B­
9(d). As such, Waters of Life Board and Waters of Life School 
are jointly and severally prohibited from suing other entities or 
agencies of the State, including Panel, CSAO, BOE, and DOE. 
DOE is one of the principal executive departments under
 
the supervision of the governor of the State. Haw. Const.
 
art. V, § 6; HRS § 26-4 (2009 Repl.). DOE is headed by an
 
3
 The circuit court did not hold that any plaintiff other than the
Waters of Life Board had standing to bring the present lawsuit.
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
executive board, which is BOE. HRS § 26-12 (2009 Repl.) Under 
the Hawai' i Constitution, BOE is vested with "the power, as 
provided by law, to formulate statewide educational policy and appoint the superintendent of education as the chief executive 
officer of the public school
[4] system." Haw. Const. art. X, § 3. 
"Under policies established by [BOE], the superintendent [of education] shall administer programs of education and public 
instruction throughout the State, including education at the 
preschool, primary, and secondary school levels, . . . and such 
other programs as may be established by law." HRS § 26-12. 
When the State legislature enacted HRS Chapter 302B,
 
the Public Charter School chapter, the legislature described the
 
charter school system as "an important complement to the [DOE's]
 
school system, one that empowers local school boards and their
 
charter schools by allowing more autonomy and flexibility and
 
placing greater responsibility at the school level." 2006 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 298, § 1 at 1200 (emphasis added). The
 
legislature described the charter school system as made up of
 
BOE, CSAO, Panel, and the individual charter schools. 2006 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 298, § 1 at 1200-01. 
BOE appoints Panel, which is administratively attached
 
to DOE and is accountable to both the charter schools and BOE. 
HRS § 302A-1101(d) (2007 Repl.); HRS § 302B-3(a). Panel is
 
empowered to "issue charters, oversee and monitor charter
 
schools, hold charter schools accountable for their performance,
 
and revoke charters." HRS § 302A-1101(d). Pursuant to HRS
 
§ 302B-3(b) (Supp. 2010), the Panel is composed of the following
 
members:
 
§302B-3 Charter school review panel; establishment;
powers and duties.
. . . . 
4
 HRS 302A-101 (2007 Repl.) defines public schools to mean "all
academic and noncollege type schools established and maintained by [DOE] and
charter schools chartered by [BOE], in accordance with law."

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(b) The panel shall consist of twelve members, and
shall include:
 
(1)	 Two licensed teachers regularly engaged in
teaching; provided that one teacher is employed
at a start-up charter school, and one teacher is
employed at a conversion charter school;
 
(2)	 Two educational officers; provided that one
educational officer is employed at a start-up
charter school, and one educational officer is
employed at a conversion charter school;
 
(3)	 One member or former member of a charter school
 local school board;
 
(4)	 The chair of the board of education or the
 chair's designee;
 
(5)	 A representative of Hawaiian culture-focused
charter schools;
 
(6)	 Two representatives of the University of Hawaii
who are not affiliated with charter schools;
 
(7)	 One member with a background in business or
accounting who is not affiliated with charter
schools;
 
(8)	 One member with a background in the building
trades or real estate who is not affiliated with
 charter schools; and
 
(9)	 A representative from the Hawaii Association of
Independent Schools[.]
 
(Emphases added.)
 
Pursuant to HRS § 302B-3(i) (Supp. 2009), Panel's
 
powers and duties include the following:
 
(i)	 The powers and duties of the panel shall be to:
 
(1)	 Appoint and evaluate the executive director and
approve staff and salary levels for the charter
school administrative office;
 
(2)	 Review, approve, or deny charter applications
for new charter schools in accordance with
 section 302B-5 for the issuance of new charters;
provided that applicants that are denied a
charter may appeal to the board for a final
decision pursuant to section 302B-3.5;
 
(3)	 Review, approve, or deny significant amendments
to detailed implementation plans to maximize the
school's financial and academic success,
long-term organizational viability, and
accountability. Charter schools that are denied
 a significant amendment to their detailed
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
implementation plan may appeal to the board for
a final decision pursuant to section 302B-3.5;
 
(4)	 Adopt reporting requirements for charter
schools;
 
(5)	 Review annual self-evaluation reports from
charter schools and take appropriate action;
 
(6)	 Evaluate any aspect of a charter school that the
panel may have concerns with and take
appropriate action, which may include probation
or revocation;
 .  .  .  .
 
(9)	 Review, modify, and approve charter schools' all
means [sic] of finance budget, based upon
criteria and an approval process established by
the panel;
 
(10)	 Survey all charter school facilities prior to,
and in preparation for, determining
recommendations to allocate non-per-pupil
facilities funds to charter schools with
 facilities needs.
 .  .  .  .
 
(j) In the case that the panel decides not to issue
a new charter, or to approve significant amendments to
detailed implementation plans, the board may adopt rules for
an appeals process pursuant to section 302B-3.5.
 
In addition to Panel, the legislature established the
 
CSAO, administered by an executive director appointed by Panel. 
HRS § 302B-8(a) (2007 Repl.). The executive director is
 
responsible for the "internal organization, operation, and
 
management of the charter school system." HRS § 302B-8(b) (Supp.
 
2010). 
To establish a charter school, the interested party or
 
parties, whether a community group, a group of teachers and/or
 
administrators, or a nonprofit organization, submits a letter of
 
intent to the CSAO. HRS § 302B-5(b) (2007 Repl.). At the same
 
time, the charter school applicant must also "establish an
 
interim local school board [(the LSB)] as its governing body, and
 
develop a detailed implementation plan." HRS § 302B-5(b).
 
The LSB is "the autonomous governing body of a charter
 
school" and
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1)	 . . . is responsible for the financial and academic
viability of the charter school and implementation of
the charter; 
(2)	 [p]ossesses the independent authority to determine the
organization and management of the school, the
curriculum, virtual education, and compliance with
applicable federal and state laws; and 
(3)	 [h]as the power to negotiate supplemental collective
bargaining agreements with exclusive representatives
of their employees.
 
HRS § 302B-1 (Supp. 2010); see also HRS § 302B-7(c) (2007 Repl.).
 
The LSB members include, at a minimum, one
 
representative from each of the following groups:
 
(1)	 Principals; 
(2)	 Instructional staff members selected by the school
instructional staff; 
(3)	 Support staff selected by the support staff of the
school; 
(4)	 Parents of students attending the school selected by
the parents of the school; 
(5)	 Student body representatives selected by the students
of the school; and 
(6)	 The community at large.
 
HRS § 302B-7(a) (2007 Repl.).
 
Panel gives the interim LSB the charter school
 
application form and completion guidelines. HRS § 302B-5(c)(2)
 
(2007 Repl.). A significant application item is the detailed
 
implementation plan. HRS § 302B-5(d) (2007 Repl.). The plan
 
must include:
 
(1)	 A description of employee rights and management issues
and a framework for addressing those issues that
protects the rights of employees;
 
(2)	 A plan for identifying, recruiting, and retaining
highly-qualified instructional faculty;
 
(3)	 A plan for identifying, recruiting, and selecting
students that is not exclusive, elitist, or
segregationist;
 
(4)	 The curriculum and instructional framework to be used
 to achieve student outcomes, including an assessment
plan;
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(5)	 A plan for the assessment of student, administrative
support, and teaching personnel performance that:
 
(A)	 Recognizes the interests of the general public;
 
(B)	 Incorporates or exceeds the educational content
and performance standards developed by the
department for the public school system;
 
(C)	 Includes a system of faculty and staff
accountability that holds faculty and staff both
individually and collectively accountable for
their performance, and that is at least
equivalent to the average system of
accountability in public schools throughout the
State; and
 
(D)	 Provides for program audits and annual financial
audits;
 
(6)	 A governance structure for the charter school that
incorporates a conflict of interest policy and a plan
for periodic training to carry out the duties of local
school board members;
 
(7)	 A financial plan based on the most recent fiscal
year's per-pupil charter school allocation that
demonstrates the ability to meet the financial
obligations of one-time, start-up costs and ongoing
costs such as monthly payrolls, faculty recruitment,
professional development, and facilities costs; and
 
(8)	 A facilities plan.
 
HRS § 302B-5(d). 
The implementation plan includes both governance and
 
educational issues, all of which are the ultimate responsibility
 
of the LSB as the governing body of the charter school.
 
Panel reviews the application; informs the interim LSB
 
whether or not the application is complete; and if the
 
application is not complete, informs LSB what elements need to be
 
completed. HRS § 302B-5(c)(4) (2007 Repl.). After completing
 
the missing elements, the application can be resubmitted. HRS
 
§ 302B-5(c)(5) (2007 Repl.). If Panel does not approve the
 
application, Panel must provide detailed reasoning for the denial
 
and allow the interim LSB to resubmit an amended plan within a
 
proscribed time period. HRS § 302B-5(c)(8) (2007 Repl.). If the
 
amended plan is not approved, the charter school applicant may
 
appeal the decision to BOE. HRS § 302B-3.5 (2007 Repl.). If the
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
application is approved, Panel issues a charter to LSB, HRS
 
§ 302B-1 (2007 Repl.), and the charter school may begin
 
operations. HRS § 302B-5(c)(10) (2007 Repl.). 
Each charter school must conduct an annual self-
evaluation at the end of the school year and send a report to
 
Panel. HRS § 302B-14(a) (2007 Repl.). Panel may also conduct a
 
special evaluation of a charter school at any time. HRS § 302B­
14(c) (2007 Repl.). The LSB is accountable to Panel. HRS
 
§ 302B-3(i). Panel has the authority to revoke the charter if
 
Panel determines the charter school has not corrected identified
 
deficiencies related to student performance, financial plans,
 
organizational viability, or health and safety. HRS § 302B­
14(b)-(f) (2007 Repl.). A charter school may appeal the
 
revocation of its charter to BOE pursuant to HRS § 302B-3.5. The
 
BOE has sixty calendar days from the filing of the appeal in
 
which to issue a final decision. Id. 
The relationship, responsibilities, duties, and
 
authority of each of the key participants in the charter school
 
system leads us to the conclusion that the LSB is not "an entity
 
separate and apart" from the charter school, but instead, the LSB
 
and the charter school jointly are the charter school. The LSB
 
receives the charter for the charter school. HRS § 302B-1 (Supp.
 
2010). The LSB is responsible for the implementation of the
 
charter, is accountable for the financial and academic viability
 
of the school, determines the organization and management of the
 
school, and assures compliance with federal and state laws. HRS
 
§ 302B-7(c). The LSB is created to govern its charter school and
 
does not exist absent a duly authorized charter school to govern. 
Conversely, the charter school cannot exist without an LSB
 
governing body. 
Furthermore, as the governing body of the charter
 
school, the LSB, together with its charter school, is part of the
 
charter school system. The charter school system, which includes
 
Panel and CSAO, is administratively attached to DOE, one of the
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
principal departments under the executive branch of the State. 
As part of a State entity administratively attached to DOE, the
 
LSB is considered an arm of the State. HRS § 26-35(b) (2009
 
Repl.) ("Every board or commission established or placed within a
 
principal department for administrative purposes or subject to
 
the administrative control or supervision of the head of the
 
department shall be considered an arm of the State and shall
 
enjoy the same sovereign immunity available to the State."). 
The LSB is also afforded the same protections afforded
 
BOE. HRS § 302B-7(f) (2007 Repl.) ("The State shall afford the
 
[LSB] of any charter school the same protections as the State
 
affords [BOE]."). As a further indication that the LSB is a
 
state entity, the LSB is specifically identified as a state board
 
under HRS § 26-35.5(a) (2009 Repl.) ("For purposes of this
 
section, "member" means any person who is appointed, in
 
accordance with the law, to serve on a temporary or permanent
 
state board, including members of the [LSB] of any charter school
 
established under chapter 302B[.]").
 
Plaintiffs argue that, based on Bd. of Educ. of State
 
of Hawaii v. Waihee, 70 Haw. 253, 768 P.2d 1279 (1989), Waters of
 
Life Board had standing to bring the declaratory judgment action. 
Plaintiffs contend Waihee stands for the proposition that one
 
State agency may seek a judicial ruling on whether another State
 
agency exceeded its statutory authority.
 
Waihee involved an intra-executive dispute where BOE 
alleged that Governor Waihee exceeded his authority when he 
imposed spending restrictions on BOE and DOE. Id. at 258, 768 
P.2d at 1282. The Hawai' i Supreme Court determined that it could 
rule on this dispute between the governor and one of his 
executive departments. Id. at 263, 768 P.2d at 1285. 
The case before us is inapposite to Waihee. In the
 
instant case, Waters of Life Board is not a State executive
 
department seeking a declaratory action against the governor. 
Instead, it is an entity within an executive department seeking
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
to sue the executive department (DOE) and its administrative
 
entities (BOE, CSAO, and Panel). Additionally, Waters of Life
 
Board, as the governing body of its charter school, is
 
statutorily prohibited from suing another State entity, pursuant
 
to HRS § 302B-9(d). The proper avenue to seek a ruling on Waters
 
of Life Board's disagreement with Panel's revocation is to appeal
 
to BOE, as set out in HRS § 302B-3.5. 
The circuit court erred when it determined that Waters 
of Life Board was a separate entity from Waters of Life School 
and was not governed by the express statutory language 
prohibiting a charter school from suing another agency or entity 
of the State. "A judgment rendered by a circuit court without 
subject matter jurisdiction is void." Lingle, 107 Hawai' i at 
182, 111 P.3d at 591 (quoting Amantiad, 90 Hawai' i at 159, 977 
P.2d at 167). The circuit court did not address the question of 
whether the Waters of Life School Parents had a private right of 
action and standing before the circuit court to bring the 
underlying case. Because this was not addressed below, we 
decline to address it in this appeal.5
