appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Judgment),

Tapanan of Harassment, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes

 HRS § 711-1106 provides, relevant part:
 
§ 711-1106 Harassment.  (1) A person commits the
offense of harassment if, with intent to harass, annoy, or
alarm any other person, that person:
 
(a) Strikes, shoves, kicks, or otherwise touches
another person in an offensive manner or
subjects the other person to offensive physical
contact[.]

On appeal, Tapanan argues that: (1) the family court
 
made clearly erroneous oral findings of fact (FOFs) such that the
 
family court's ultimate finding of guilt must be overturned; and
 (2) there was insufficient evidence in support of her conviction. 
Tapanan thus seeks to have her conviction reversed. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Tapanan's points of error as follows.
3
 
(1) Tapanan asserts that the family court
 
"specifically found that Officer Arakaki and Officer Kira
 testified truthfully" and therefore the family court committed
 clear error in finding that:
 
(1) I'm just not left – given the lasting impression [that
the Officers] did a thorough investigation.
 
(2) I don't think [the Officers] followed through well.
 
(3) [The Officers] didn't follow up very properly.
 (4) I do not think [the Officers] did a thorough investigation.
 (5) I don't think [the Officers] did a thorough examination of any
of the parties.
 
(6) [Mechael] was only asked to leave for 24 hours.
 (7) I think the officer at Kalihi Station three days later did a
far better investigation of this case. 
Importantly, the family court's primary findings were
 
that, although there were inconsistencies, "[i]f I have to look 
3 We will exercise jurisdiction in this case although the notice of
appeal was filed thirty-one days after the March 16, 2010 Judgment and was
thus untimely. See Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure, Rule 4(b). We 
exercise jurisdiction pursuant to the Hawai' i Supreme Court's recognized
exception as set forth in State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai' i 404, 407, 967 P.2d 236,
239 (1998) ("In criminal cases, we have made exceptions to the requirementthat notices of appeal be timely filed. Our recognized exceptions involvecircumstances where . . . defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectivelyfailed to pursue a defendant's appeal from a criminal conviction in the firstinstance[.]"); see also State v. Knight, 80 Hawai' i 318, 323-24, 909 P.2d
1133, 1138-39 (1996).

at this entire package of what happened that day, this court is 
left with the clear feeling beyond a reasonable doubt that an offense of harassment did take place, and the court will adjudicate and convict the defendant of that offense." Moreover, in our view, Tapanan takes out of context the statement by the family court that "I don't think . . . the officer testified untruthfully." Rather, all of the findings that Tapanan challenges were immediately thereafter part and parcel of the family court's overall findings as to Officers Arakaki and Kira. In a bench trial, it is the province of the trial court to determine the credibility of witnesses and to weigh the evidence, and we will give due deference to those determinations. State v. 
Ferm, 94 Hawai' i 17, 27, 7 P.3d 193, 203 (App. 2000); State v. 
Aplaca, 74 Haw. 54, 65, 837 P.2d 1298, 1304-05 (1992). Additionally, and contrary to Tapanan's suggestion, we conclude that State v. Ruiz, 49 Haw. 504, 421 P.2d 305 (1966) is not on point or persuasive. 
The only challenged finding that we determine to be 
clearly erroneous is the length of time Mechael Tapanan was asked to stay away from the apartment. That is, there is not substantial evidence that Mechael Tapanan was asked to leave for 24 hours. This erroneous finding, however, did not affect Tapanan's substantial rights and was harmless error. Hawai' i 
Rules of Penal Procedure, Rule 52(a). The other findings challenged by Tapanan are not clearly erroneous. 
(2) In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence 
to support a conviction, we consider the evidence in the strongest light for the prosecution. State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 
19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998). In this case, the testimony of Mechael Tapanan, Herman Ling, and Officer Moerless, as well as the photographs of injuries to Mechael Tapanan admitted into

evidence, provide substantial evidence to support Tapanan's
 
conviction.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence, filed on March 16, 2010, in the Family Court of the
 First Circuit, is affirmed.
