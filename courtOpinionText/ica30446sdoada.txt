MANUEL J. MENENDEZ, JR., Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAHIAWÂ DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-09-069033)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Manuel Jose Menendez Jr. (Menendez)
 
appeals from a Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment (Judgment) in Case No. 1DTC-09-069033, filed
 
April 8, 2010, in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 
Wahiawâ Division (district court).1 Menendez was orally charged
 
with, inter alia, Excessive Speeding in violation of Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291C-105(a)(1) and/or (a)(2) (Supp.
 
2011). After a bench trial, Menendez was convicted as charged of
 
Excessive Speeding.
 
On appeal, Menendez contends that the district court
 
erred by: (1) denying Menendez's motion to dismiss the Excessive
 
Speeding charge for failure to include the mens rea;
 
(2) admitting laser speed reading evidence without a proper

foundation because the testimony was barred by the best evidence
 
rule; (3) admitting testimony as to the speed limit on the H2
 
freeway in violation of the best evidence rule; and (4) admitting
 
evidence of the speed limit at the citation location given the
 
evidence in the case.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Menendez's appeal as follows.
 
On the day of trial, after the oral charges were
 
presented, Menendez objected to the Excessive Speeding charge on
 
the basis that it failed to allege a mens rea. The district
 
court denied the objection and after a bench trial Menendez was
 
convicted of Excessive Speeding.
 
On appeal, Menendez contends that mens rea is an 
element of the offense of Excessive Speeding and pursuant to State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 219 P.3d 1170 (2009), 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) was required to 
include the mens rea in the charge. 
In State v. Gonzalez, No. SCAP-11-0000500, 2012 WL 
5970946 (Haw. Nov. 28, 2012), the Hawai' i Supreme Court recently 
held that the offense of Excessive Speeding in violation of 
HRS § 291C-105(a) "is not a strict liability offense and requires 
proof that the defendant acted intentionally, knowingly, or 
recklessly. Thus, the requisite states of mind must be alleged 
in a charge of this offense." Id. at 1, 2; see also State v. 
Nesmith, 127 Hawai' i 48, 56, 276 P.3d 617, 625 (2012) (holding 
that the failure to allege a mens rea in charging the offense of 
operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant in 
violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) rendered the charge insufficient 
because the charge failed "to alert the defendants of precisely 
what they needed to defend against to avoid a conviction."). The

Gonzalez court further held that HRS § 702-204  applies to
HRS § 291C-105(a). See id. at 26. 
Accordingly, in light of Gonzalez, the district court
 
erred in denying Menendez's objection to the Excessive Speeding
 
charge. Because the Excessive Speeding charge under HRS § 291C­
105(a), as alleged against Menendez in this case, failed to
 
allege the requisite state of mind, the April 8, 2010 Judgment
 
must be vacated and the case remanded to the district court for
 
dismissal without prejudice. See Gonzalez, at 2. We need not
 
reach the remaining points of error advanced by Menendez. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the April 8, 2010 Judgment
 
entered by the district court is vacated and the case is remanded
 to the district court to dismiss the Excessive Speeding charge
 
without prejudice.

 HRS § 702-204 (1993 Repl.) states that "[w]hen the state of mind
required to establish an element of an offense is not specified by the law,
that element is established if, with respect thereto, a person acts
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly."
