STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
GRANT Y. CUMMINS, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-09-05664)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Grant Y. Cummins (Cummins) appeals
 
from the "Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment" (Judgment), filed on April 15, 2010 in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit (district court).1 Cummins
 
was charged with Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an
 Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) and (a)(3) (Supp. 2009).
2 As set forth in
 
1
 The Honorable William A. Cardwell presided.
 
2
 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (3) provide:
 
§291E-61 Operating a vehicle under the influence of an
intoxicant. (a) A person commits the offense of operating a
vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant if the person
operates or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
(continued...)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Judgment, the district court convicted Cummins of violating
 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(3). Cummins was acquitted of the charge under
 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1). The district court sentenced Cummins to pay
 
a $250 fine and various fees and undergo an alcohol assessment
 
and substance abuse treatment. 
On appeal, Cummins argues that: (1) the district court
 
erred in convicting him of OVUII based on his Intoxilyzer test
 
results, because before he took the Intoxilyzer test, he was told
 
by a police officer that he would have to pay $300 to take a
 
blood test; and (2) the district court violated Cummins's right
 
to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States
 
Constitution by admitting into evidence two Supervisor's Sworn
 
Statements regarding accuracy tests conducted on the Intoxilyzer
 
instrument, where the supervisors did not testify at trial.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Cummins's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Upon being arrested for OVUII and taken to the
 
police station, Cummins was advised about the implied consent
 
law, including that he could "refuse to submit to a breath or
 
blood test, or both for the purpose of determining alcohol
 
concentration." He was further advised that if he refused
 
testing, he would be "subject to the procedures and sanctions
 
2(...continued)
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an
 
amount sufficient to impair the person's normal
mental faculties or ability to care for the
person and guard against casualty; [or]
 
.  .  .
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two
hundred ten liters of breath[.]
 
There are two versions of HRS § 291E-61 contained in the HRS 2009 Cumulative
Supplement. The version applicable to this case is the one effective until
December 31, 2010.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
under chapter 291E, part III, or 291E-65 as applicable." In
 
explaining the options, a police officer additionally advised
 
Cummins that if he chose to submit to a blood test he would have
 
to pay $300 for the test, whereas the breath test was free.
 
Relying on State v. Wilson, 92 Hawai' i 45, 987 P.2d 268 
(1999), Cummins contends that "[n]o part of the implied consent 
law permits the police to misinform a driver about a blood test 
in order to induce the driver to take an Intoxilyzer test" and 
thus the district court erred in admitting into evidence the 
results of the Intoxilyzer test. 
The information provided by the police officer, that
 
Cummins would have to pay $300 out-of-pocket for the blood test,
 
was not accurate. Such payment could be ordered only after a
 
person was sentenced under HRS § 291E-61, or a person was
 
convicted or had his or her license or privilege suspended or
 
revoked pursuant to chapter 291E. HRS § 291E-61(f)(2009 Supp.)
 
and § 291E-11(g)(2007 Repl.).3 Moreover, under the applicable
 
statutes, ordering payment for a blood test is discretionary and
 not mandatory. HRS § 291E-61(f) and § 291E-11(g).
 
Although we do not condone the incorrect information
 
provided to Cummins in this case, the circumstances here are
 
distinguishable from the circumstances in Wilson and do not
 
warrant exclusion of the Intoxilyzer test results. Both the
 
applicable law and the impact of the incorrect information
 
provided in this case are materially different than in Wilson.

 HRS § 291E-61(f) provides, "[a]ny person sentenced under this section
may be ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of any blood or urine
tests conducted pursuant to section 291E-11." Moreover, § 291E-11(g)
provides, "[a]ny person tested pursuant to this section who is convicted or
has the person's license or privilege suspended or revoked pursuant to this
chapter may be ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of any blood or
urine tests, or both, conducted pursuant to this section."

In Wilson, information provided to the defendant
 
advised him of the consequences for refusing to take any tests,
 
compared to the consequences for taking a test and failing it. 
After being advised that he could take either a blood test or
 
breath test or both, the defendant was further advised:
 
That if you refuse to take any tests the consequences are as
follows: (1) if your driving record shows no prior alcohol
enforcement contacts during the five years preceeding [sic]
the date of arrest, your driving privileges will be revoked
for one year instead of the three month revocation that
 would apply if you chose to take the test and failed it[.]
 
92 Hawai' i at 47, 987 P.2d at 270. In this context, the 
defendant was misinformed that, if he elected to take a test and 
failed it, a three-month license revocation would apply; rather, 
under the prevailing case law, the defendant's license could 
actually be revoked for up to one year. Id. at 51, 987 P.2d at 
274. The defendant elected to take a blood test and at trial,
 
moved to suppress the blood test results. The trial court
 
granted the defendant's suppression motion and the State
 
subsequently appealed. Id. at 46-48, 987 P.2d at 269-71.
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court held that the arresting 
officer had violated the consent requirements under the then-
existing statutory scheme in HRS Chapter 286 by misinforming the
 
defendant about the sanctions he faced for taking and failing the
 
blood test. Id. at 51, 53-54, 987 P.2d at 274, 276-77.
 
Under this "implied consent" scheme, when a person is
arrested for violation of HRS § 291-4, the arresting officer
must, inter alia, "take possession of any license held by
the person and request the arrestee to take a test for
concentration of alcohol in the blood." HRS § 286-255(a)
(Supp.1998). Upon informing the arrestee of his or her
choice of taking a breath test, blood test, or both, "[t]he
arresting officer shall also inform the person of the
sanctions under this part, including the sanction for
refusing to take a breath or a blood test." See id.
 
(emphasis added). HRS § 286-151 likewise requires that "the
 test or tests shall be administered ... only after ... [t]he
person has been informed by a police officer of the
sanctions under part XIV and sections 286-151.5 and
286-157.3." (Emphasis added.) Thus, as the statutory
language makes clear, a driver's "implied consent" to an
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
evidentiary chemical alcohol test is qualified by his or her
implied right to refuse such a test after being accurately
informed of his or her statutory right to consent or refuse,
as well as the consequences of such consent or refusal.
 
Id. at 48-49, 987 P.2d at 271-72 (bold emphasis added) (footnote 
omitted). The supreme court held that "although Wilson elected 
to take the test, he did not make a knowing and intelligent 
decision whether to exercise his statutory right of consent or 
refusal." Id. at 51, 987 P.2d at 274; see also State v. Garcia 
96 Hawai' i 200, 204, 29 P.3d 919, 923 (2001) (discussing the 
decision in Wilson). 
Importantly, suppression of the defendant's blood test 
results was deemed proper in Wilson due to the arresting 
officer's violation of HRS Chapter 286, which at that time set 
out the implied consent law. 92 Hawai' i at 52 n.10, 987 P.2d at 
275 n.10 (stating that "[t]his court has previously indicated 
that the exclusion of evidence based on a statutory violation is 
proper under appropriate circumstances" and citing to State v. 
Pattioay, 78 Hawai' i 455, 467, 896 P.2d 911, 923 (1995)); see 
also Garcia, 96 Hawai' i at 204, 29 P.3d at 923 (noting that in 
Wilson, the court had "affirmed suppression of the test results . 
. . under this court's supervisory powers as espoused in 
Pattioay."). 
In this case, under the statutory provisions applicable
 
to Cummins, the consent requirements are different than in
 
Wilson. HRS § 291E-11 requires, inter alia, that a person
 
arrested upon probable cause be informed that he or she may
 
refuse to submit to testing.4 It is undisputed that Cummins was
 
4
 HRS § 291E-11 states in relevant part:
 
§291E-11 Implied consent of operator of vehicle to
submit to testing to determine alcohol concentration and
drug content.  (a) Any person who operates a vehicle upon a
public way, street, road, or highway or on or in the waters
of the State shall be deemed to have given consent, subject

5
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
informed that he could refuse to submit to testing. Moreover,
 
under § 291E-15 (2007 Repl.), a law enforcement officer was
 
required to inform Cummins of applicable sanctions for refusing
 
5
to submit to a breath or blood test  only after it was initially
determined that Cummins had refused to submit to any testing.6
 
4(...continued)
to this part, to a test or tests approved by the director of
health of the person's breath, blood, or urine for the
purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug content
of the person's breath, blood, or urine, as applicable.
(b)
 The test or tests shall be administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer having probable cause
to believe the person operating a vehicle upon a public way,
street, road, or highway or on or in the waters of the State
is under the influence of an intoxicant or is under the age
of twenty-one and has consumed a measurable amount of
alcohol, only after:
(1)	 A lawful arrest; and
(2)	 The person has been informed by a law
enforcement officer that the person may refuse
to submit to testing under this chapter.
(c) If there is probable cause to believe that a person is
in violation of . . . section 291E-61 . . . as a result of having
consumed alcohol, then the person shall elect to take a breath or
blood test, or both, for the purpose of determining the alcohol
concentration.
 
(Emphasis added).
5 If there is probable cause to believe a person violated HRS § 291E-61
as a result of having consumed alcohol, the person elects between taking a
breath or blood test or both to determine alcohol concentration. HRS § 291E­11(c). If there is probable cause to believe a person violated HRS § 291E-61
as a result of having consumed any drug, the person elects between taking a
blood or urine test or both to determine drug content. HRS § 291E-11(d).
6 HRS § 291E-15 states:
 
§291E-15 Refusal to submit to breath, blood, or urine
test; subject to administrative revocation proceedings.  If
 
a person under arrest refuses to submit to a breath, blood,
or urine test, none shall be given, except as provided in
section 291E-21. Upon the law enforcement officer's
determination that the person under arrest has refused to
submit to a breath, blood, or urine test, if applicable,
then a law enforcement officer shall:
 
(1)	 Inform the person under arrest of the sanctions
under section 291E-41 or 291E-65; and
(2)	 Ask the person if the person still refuses to submit
to a breath, blood, or urine test, thereby subjecting
the person to the procedures and sanctions under part
(continued...)

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 291E-15; see also § 291E-41(d) (2007 Repl.). Here, Cummins
 
did not refuse to submit to testing, instead consenting to take
 
the breath test. Given the applicable statutory scheme in this
 
case, unlike in Wilson, there was no violation of the statutorily
 
mandated informed consent.
 
Additionally, the incorrect information challenged in 
this case –- that Cummins would have to pay $300 out-of-pocket 
for a blood test –- was not relevant to his decision whether to 
consent to testing or not. Rather, it was relevant only as to 
which test he would elect to take. This is substantively and 
materially distinct from the circumstances and ruling in Wilson, 
where the misinformation was relevant to the defendant's decision 
whether to consent or refuse to testing, and thus "prejudice 
inhered" because it affected his potential penalties. See 92 
Hawai'i at 52 n.9, 987 P.2d at 275 n.9; Garcia, 96 Hawai' i at 207, 
29 P.3d at 926 (stating that in Wilson, "prejudice inhered in the 
failure of the police to properly render a complete explanation 
of the penalties to the driver in the first place"); see also 
Castro v. Admin. Dir. of the Courts, 97 Hawai' i 463, 40 P.3d 865 
(2002) (because the meaning of "prior alcohol enforcement contact" was not explained and the import of information provided 
to defendant was that three or more prior contacts would result 
in license revocation for life regardless of whether he submitted 
to testing, his refusal to take any tests was not knowing or 
intelligently made). 
6(...continued)
 
III or section 291E-65, as applicable;
provided that if the law enforcement officer fails to comply with
paragraphs (1) and (2), the person shall not be subject to the
refusal sanctions under part III or section 291E-65.

Therefore, the district court was correct in concluding
 
that Wilson did not require exclusion of the Intoxilyzer breath
 
test results in this case and thus properly admitted the test
 
results into evidence. 
(2) The State's Exhibit 4 was an "Intoxilyzer 8000 
Accuracy Test Supervisor's Sworn Statement" (Intoxilyzer Accuracy 
Statement) dated November 13, 2009, sworn to by Intoxilyzer 
supervisor Tracy J. Morita. The State's Exhibit 5 was an 
Intoxilyzer Accuracy Statement dated December 2, 2009 and sworn 
to by Intoxilyzer supervisor Richard Staszyn. Cummins's right to 
confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the United States 
Constitution was not violated when the district court denied his 
motion to suppress the State's Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5. State v. 
Marshall, 114 Hawai' i 396, 399-402, 163 P.3d 199, 202-05 (App. 
2007) (holding that an Intoxilyzer supervisor's sworn statements, 
that the Intoxilyzer used to test the defendant had been properly 
calibrated and tested for accuracy, were not "testimonial" 
hearsay and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of the 
confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment); see also State v. 
Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i 354, 374, 227 P.3d 520, 540 (2010) 
(holding that a speed check card "created in a non-adversarial setting in the regular course of maintaining [a] police vehicle, 
five months prior to the alleged speeding incident" was 
nontestimonial, and its admission did not violate the Sixth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution).

 Cummins has not challenged the admission of Exhibits 4 and 5 under
the confrontation clause in the Hawai' i Constitution and thus we do not reach 
that issue. See Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i at 371 n.10, 227 P.3d at 537 n.10.
