(1DTA-09-05116 and 1DTI-09-132341)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Michael G. Dalisay (Dalisay)
 
appeals the February 11, 2010 Judgment entered by the District
 
Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (district court)1
 
that convicted him of Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of
an Intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 291E-61(a)(1) (Supp. 2009).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On November 23, 2009, a Complaint was filed charging
 
Dalisay with OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1).2 On
 
February 10, 2010, the date of trial, Dalisay moved to dismiss,
 
asserting that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction
 
because the charge did not state mens rea, and at the conclusion
 
of evidence, moved for a judgment of acquittal based on the
 
deficiency of the charge for lack of the mens rea. The district
 
court denied both motions. The district court found Dalisay
 
guilty under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and entered its judgment of
 
conviction. This timely appeal followed.
 
On appeal, Dalisay contends that the district court 
erred in denying the motion to dismiss the charge and denying his 
motion for judgment of acquittal where the charge was flawed for 
failure to allege state of mind required as an essential fact 
pursuant to Rule 7(d) of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP). 
The State argues that state of mind is not required
 
under HRPP Rule 7(d) because OVUII is a general intent crime
 where intent is implied by the act, and that Dalisay was
 
adequately informed of the charge.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Dalisay's point of error as follows.

 The Complaint read:
 
On or about the 8th day of November, 2009, in the City
and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, MICHAEL G. DALISAY,
did operate or assume actual physical control of a vehicle
upon a public way, street, road, or highway while under the
influence of alcohol in an amount sufficient to impair his
normal mental faculties or ability to care for himself and
guard against casualty, thereby committing the offense of
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant, in
violation of Section 291E-61(a)(1) of the Hawaii Revised
Statutes.

 under subsection
 Dalisay was charged with OVUII
(a)(1), which requires a showing of impairment and does not
 
reflect the legislative intent to create an absolute liability
 
offense. 
Consequently, the state of mind requirements of
 
HRS § 702-204 (1993) apply to OVUII under subsection (a)(1). 
HRS § 701-102(3) (1993); 
see also Commentary on § 701-102 (making
 
state of mind requirements applicable to non-Penal-Code statutory
 offenses). Thus, as no state of mind is specified in
 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (2), the state of mind of intentionally,
 
knowingly, or recklessly would apply.
 
Irrespective of the state of mind to be proved under 
any subsection of OVUII, whether that state of mind must be 
alleged in the charging document is a separate matter. The issue 
of whether a charge contains all essential elements of the 
offense is reviewed de novo. State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 
390, 219 P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009). 
The Wheeler court analyzed a district court case for 
sufficiency of the charge and stated that "an accusation must sufficiently allege all of the essential elements of the offense 
charged, a requirement that obtains whether an accusation is in 
the nature of an oral charge, information, indictment, or 
complaint." Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178 
3 HRS § 291E-61(a) stated:
 
Operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant.
(a) A person commits the offense of operating a vehicle
under the influence of an intoxicant if the person operates
or assumes actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
 
sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty;
 
(2)	 While under the influence of any drug that impairs the
person's ability to operate the vehicle in a careful
and prudent manner;
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath; or
 
(4)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred
milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood.

(emphasis added, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
Wheeler also referenced HRS § 702-205 (1993), which specifies the 
elements of an offense as the conduct, attendant circumstances, 
and results of conduct. 121 Hawai' i at 391-92, 219 P.3d at 
1178-79. As determined in State v. Klinge, 92 Hawai' i 577, 584 
n.3, 994 P.2d 509, 516 n.3 (2000), "under HRS § 702-205, state of 
mind is not an 'element' of a criminal offense." Nevertheless, 
state of mind must be proved. See HRS §§ 701-102(3) and 702-204. 
Contrary to Dalisay's claim that state of mind is
 
required in the charge as part of the "essential facts" mandated
 
in HRPP Rule 7(d),4
 "[i]n general, where the statute sets forth
with reasonable clarity all 
essential elements of the crime 
intended to be punished, and fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common 
understanding, a charge drawn in the language of the statute is 
sufficient." State v. Mita, 124 Hawai' i 385, 391-92, 245 P.3d 
458, 464-65 (2010) (referencing the "plain, concise and definite statement of essential facts" requirement of HRPP Rule 7(d) and 
citing Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180) (some 
brackets added; internal quotation marks and some brackets omitted)). 
Additionally, similar to the provisions of HRS § 806-28
 
(1993) applicable to circuit court proceedings, state of mind
 
need not be specified in the charge in district court proceedings
 
where such state of mind is not contained in the statute defining
 
the offense. See State v. Yonaha, 68 Haw. 586, 586, 723 P.2d
 
185, 185-86 (1986); State v. Faulkner, 61 Haw. 177, 178, 599 P.2d
 
4
 HRPP Rule 7(d) states, in part:
 
(d) Nature and Contents. The charge shall be a plain,
concise and definite statement of the essential facts
 
constituting the offense charged. . . . Formal defects,
including erroneous reference to the statute, rule,
regulation or other provision of law, or the omission of
such reference, shall not be ground for dismissal of the
charge or for reversal of a conviction if the defect did not
prejudice the defendant.

285, 286 (1979); State v. Jendrusch, 58 Haw. 279, 281-82, 567
 
P.2d 1242, 1244 (1977).5
 
Further, in a charge of OVUII, a general intent crime,6
 
the state of mind can be inferred without specification in the
 
charge.7 Consequently, Dalisay's charge of OVUII under
 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) does not require specification of the state
 of mind. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its
 
discretion in denying Dalisay's motion to dismiss and motion for
 
judgment of acquittal.
 
Therefore, the February 11, 2010 Judgment of District
 
Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division is affirmed.

5 Although the cases refer to state of mind as an "element," these
cases preceded State v. Klinge, 92 Hawai' i at 584 n.3, 994 P.2d at 516 n.3,
which clarified that state of mind is not an essential element of an offense.

Mollenberg v. State, 907 So.2d 554, 556 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2005); State v.
Creamer, 996 P.2d 339, 345 (Kan. Ct. App. 2000).

 See State v. Kane, 3 Haw. App. 450, 457, 652 P.2d 642, 647-48 (1982)
 
("the statement of the act itself implies the requisite intent"); Black's Law
Dictionary 882 (9th ed. 1990) ("[t]he intent to perform an act even though the
actor does not desire the consequences of that result"); State v. Bull, 61
Haw. 62, 66, 597 P.2d 10, 13 (1979) ("the intent may be inferred from the
conduct of the accused and the circumstances and environment of the
 occurrence") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Territory v.
Tacuban, 40 Haw. 208, 212 (Haw. Terr. 1953) ("An allegation of participation
or taking part in a gambling game connotes guilty knowledge, and inferentially
alleges scienter."); State v. McDowell, 66 Haw. 650, 651, 672 P.2d 554, 555
(1983) ("Both [the carrying firearm charge in Kane and possession of firearm
charge in McDowell] are general intent crimes and neither section specifies
the requisite general intent to prove the crime.").
