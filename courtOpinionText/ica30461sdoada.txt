OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JUSTINNA MATTOS, Defendant-Appellee v.
EXODUS BAIL BONDS, Real-Party-In-Interest-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0662)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Real-Party-In-Interest-Appellant Exodus Bail Bonds
 
(Exodus) appeals from the Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Bail
 
Forfeiture, filed on May 11, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit (Circuit Court).1
 
Exodus contends that the Circuit Court erred by denying
 
its Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture. Exodus argues that it
 showed good cause, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 804-51 (Supp. 2010), thereby entitling it to the return of the
 
bail that was forfeited due to the bailee's failure to appear in
 
court. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Exodus's points of error as follows:

In short, Exodus had until February 19, 2010 to file a 
motion or application showing that the bailee surrendered or was 
surrendered, i.e., within 30 days of Exodus's January 20, 2010 
receipt of notice of the January 12, 2010 Judgment and Order of 
Forfeiture of Bail Bond. State v. Ranger Ins. Co., 83 Hawai' i 
118, 123, 925 P.2d 288, 293 (1996). Exodus admitted that the bailee was not surrendered until June 21, 2010. Hence, Exodus 
failed to show good cause to vacate the Judgment and Order of 
Forfeiture of Bail Bond. Therefore, the Circuit Court did not 
abuse its discretion by denying the Motion to Set Aside Bail 
Forfeiture. 
HRS § 804-51 does not permit the filing of a second 
motion, however nominated, after the closing of the thirty-day 
window. Ranger, 83 Hawai' i at 124 n.5, 925 P.2d at 294 n.5. 
Therefore, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion by denying Exodus's Motion to Reconsider Denial of Moiton to Set-
Aside Bail Forfeiture, filed on September 13, 2010. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's May 11, 2010
 
Order Denying Motion to Set Aside Bail Forfeiture is affirmed.
