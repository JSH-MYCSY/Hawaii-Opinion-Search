STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
FRANCIS MICHAEL MERRIMAN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
LIHUE DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 5DTI-09-018508)

 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Francis Michael Merriman (Merriman)
 
appeals from the Judgment filed on March 10, 2010 in the District
 
Court of the Fifth Circuit, Lihue Division.1 Merriman was found
 
guilty of Noncompliance with the Speed Limit, in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง291C-102 (2007), and was assessed
 fines of $177. 
On appeal, Merriman argues:
 
The traffic citation 1-HRS 508 291C-102 and 24
 
was issued on Dec. 22, 2009, stating I was going 39mph
in a 15mph zone. The 15mph sign was posted on the
electronic speed signs where the police officer was
standing. He clocked me at a distance of 360' at
 39mph. Check, Google map as marked exhibit #1. Also,
Exhibit 2, 3, 4 are photos taken December 23, 2009, in
my photo 2, shows cane haul road right lane was still
open. The evidence produced by officer, Robert
Gausefhol provided by Michael K. Hinazumi, District
Construction Engineer is false as to, the sign at the
time of the infraction. After the trial DPA Lucas
 Burns stated this evidence was taken 2-4 days before
the trial March 10, 2010. My contension (sic) not
stated in the case. Conflicting photo evidence, the
officer did not take any photos after the citation. 
He perjured himself on the witness stand. The
 
trial decision should be revoked if the appeals court
and justice should be served.

We construe Merriman's claim as one of insufficient
 
evidence.
 
"The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show 
error by reference to matters in the record, and he [or she] has 
the responsibility of providing an adequate transcript." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
'i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 
558 (1995) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984)). "If the appellant intends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant shall include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to such finding or conclusion." Haw. R. App. P. 10(b)(3). 
The record on appeal before this court does not contain
 
any written testimony or include a transcript of the
 proceeding(s) referenced in Merriman's Opening Brief. Merriman
 failed to order a copy of the necessary transcript(s) for the
 record on appeal. Consequently, there is nothing in the record
 on appeal regarding the officer's actions and testimony. Thus,
 Merriman has failed to establish any error. State v. Hoang, 93
 
Hawaii 333, 335-36, 3 P.3d 499, 501-02 (2000).
 
Therefore, 
The Judgment filed on March 10, 2010 in the District
 
Court of the Fifth Circuit, Lihue Division, is affirmed.
