IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ROBERT D. JERVIS, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-09-077007)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Robert D. Jervis (Jervis) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment filed on March 24, 2010 in the District Court of
 
the First Circuit, Honolulu Division (District Court).1 After a
 
bench trial, Jervis was convicted of Excessive Speeding, in
 violation of HRS § 291C-105(a)(1) (2007 Repl.). 
At trial, Jervis objected when Officer Russell Maeshiro 
(Officer Maeshiro) testified as to the reading of the laser speed 
gun used to track Jervis's speed, in part on grounds that 
Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai' i (State) failed to introduce 
into evidence the manual for the laser speed gun. The District Court overruled the objection.

On appeal, Jervis raises one point of error, asserting
 
that the "best evidence rule" was violated when the District
 
Court allowed testimony about the laser gun manual, rather than
 
requiring submission of the relevant portion of the manual
 
itself. Jervis thus contends there was insufficient foundation
 
for admission of the laser speed reading in this case.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Jervis’s point of error as follows.
 
"When application of a particular evidentiary rule can 
yield only one correct result, the proper standard for appellate 
review is the right/wrong standard." Kealoha v. County of 
Hawai'i, 74 Haw. 308, 319, 844 P.2d 670, 676 (1993). In applying 
the best evidence rule in this case, we therefore review the 
issue on appeal de novo. 
Pursuant to Rule 1002 of the Hawaii Rules of Evidence
 
(HRE), "[t]o prove the content of a writing, recording, or
 
photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is
 
required, except as otherwise provided in these rules or by
 
statute." HRE Rule 1002 (2010). In the instant case, Officer
 
Maeshiro's testimony about the manual was not adduced to prove
 
the contents of the manual, but rather to establish foundation
 
for his testimony on the operation and speed reading of the laser
 
gun. That is, his testimony referencing the manual was to show
 
that his training and testing of the laser gun was based on the
 
manufacturer's manual.
 
Because the purpose of Officer Maeshiro's testimony
 
about the manual was not to prove the contents of the writing,
 
HRE Rule 1002 does not apply. See Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v.
 
Stites, 258 F.3d 1016, 1023 (9th Cir. 2001) (best evidence rule
 did not apply where evidence was not offered to prove the content
 
of a writing); Smith v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 814 F.2d 1481,
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
1486 (10th Cir. 1987) (holding that the best evidence rule was
 
not violated where witnesses "did not testify in any detail to
 
what was contained in the documents" which evidenced a federal
 
agency's approval and instead simply testified that such approval
 
existed); U.S. v. Carlock, 806 F.2d 535, 551 (5th Cir. 1986) (lay
 
witness secretaries' testimony based on a work list was not to
 
prove the contents of the list, but to show the list was not
 
always followed); Lang v. Cullen, 725 F. Supp. 2d 925, 953-54
 
(C.D. Cal. 2010) (opinion testimony of experts quoting witness
 
testimony and declarations to form the foundation of their
 
opinions was not a violation of the best evidence rule, and any
 
asserted deviation from the witness testimony or declarations
 
should have been revealed in cross-examination).
 
The cases upon which Jervis relies are distinguishable. 
In each of the cases he cites, the content of the writing was
 
directly at issue. See U.S. v. Bennett, 363 F.3d 947, 949 (9th
 
Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 950 (2004) (ruling that
 because content of GPS display was utilized to prove that
 
defendant came from Mexico, the display itself was the best
 
evidence and custom officer's testimony as to display violated
 
best evidence rule); U.S. v. Humphrey, 104 F.3d 65 (5th Cir.
 
1997) (holding that judgment was the best evidence of prior
 
successful civil action); Conway v. Consol. Rail Corp., 720 F.2d
 
221 (1st Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 937 (1984) (proffered
 
testimony that written rules and regulations did not contain any
 
restriction on size of luggage aboard train was not the best
 
evidence).
 
Even if it were presumed that Officer Maeshiro's
 
testimony was offered to prove the content of the manual, the
 
manual "is not closely related to a controlling issue" and thus
 
3
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
pertains to a "collateral matter". See HRE Rule 1004(4).2
 
Further, as the State notes and Jervis does not dispute, Jervis
 
was allowed discovery for access to and a copy of the laser gun's
 
manual. At trial, Jervis therefore could have cross-examined
 
Officer Maeshiro regarding his testimony about the manual, as
 
well as whether the laser gun manufacturer's recommended testing
 
and training was met to allow admissibility of the speed reading. 
For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the
 
District Court did not err in allowing Officer Maeshiro to
 
testify about the manual and in not requiring admission of the
 
manual into evidence. Consequently, the District Court did not
 
err in admitting into evidence the laser gun reading. Jervis
 
does not otherwise argue that foundation was insufficient for the
 
laser gun reading. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the Notice of Entry of
 
Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment filed on March 24, 2010
 
in the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division, is
 
affirmed.
