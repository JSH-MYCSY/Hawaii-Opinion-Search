applicable statute of limitations. 
On appeal, Thomas contends that the Circuit Court erred 
in holding that her legal-malpractice claims did not accrue for 
statute-of-limitations purposes until the conclusion of the appellate process that she initiated following the April 3, 2003 adverse decision of the Hawai' i Labor and Industrial Relations 
Appeals Board ("LIRAB"). 
We affirm.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. Factual and procedural background to the Complaint
 Thomas alleges that on or about March 3, 1995, Sterns
 
agreed to represent Thomas in connection with repetitive stress
 
injuries that Thomas sustained working as a secretary and office
 manager. Thomas had already sought and received reimbursement
 from a workers' compensation claim stemming from her injuries in
 1988. Among other things, Sterns agreed to reopen Thomas's
 workers' compensation claim. Sterns advised Thomas that "the
 statute of limitations for reopening a workers' compensation
 claim was ten years, i.e., that the claim would lapse in 1998." 
Thomas further alleges that on or around July 10, 1997,
 
Defendants discovered that the limitations period for reopening a
 workers' compensation claim "had changed to eight years (i.e.,
 not ten as Defendant Sterns believed), and that the deadline for
 [Thomas's] claim had lapsed sometime in 1996." Soon after this
 discovery, Sterns withdrew as counsel for Thomas but never
 informed her that the limitations period for bringing her
 workers' compensation claim had lapsed. 
On May 28, 1998, Thomas filed a request to reopen her 
workers' compensation case with the Director of the Hawai' i 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations ("Director"). The Director denied Thomas's request on the basis that it was not filed within eight years of the last payment of compensation as required by Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 386-89. On April 3, 2003, the LIRAB affirmed the Director's decision. Thomas v. Law Offices of J.T. Thomas, No. AB 2001-219(M)(7-88­04491)(Hilo), 2003 WL 21076040 (Haw. LIR App. Apr. 3, 2003).

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Thomas appealed to this court from the LIRAB's
 
decision. We affirmed, holding that "Claimant's request [to
 
reopen her claim] was barred by HRS § 386-89(c)," which required
 that she reopen her claim "within eight years after the last
 payment of compensation on account of her June 1988 injury[.]" 
Thomas v. Law Offices of J.T. Thomas, No. 25795, 2006 WL 2338043,
 *2 (Haw. Ct. App. Aug. 11, 2006) (SDO) ("Thomas I"). Since
 Thomas received her final workers' compensation payment on
 December 29, 1988, the deadline for reopening her claim had been
 December 29, 1996.
 
Finally, Thomas applied to the Hawai' i Supreme Court 
for a writ of certiorari on September 11, 2006. The supreme court rejected the application by an order dated October 24, 2006. 
B. Thomas's Complaint and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss
 
On July 28, 2009, Thomas filed her Complaint in the
 
Circuit Court. The Complaint asserted three legal-malpractice
 
counts and one unfair-and-deceptive-trade-practices count against
 Defendants based on Defendants' alleged failure to act to reopen
 Thomas's workers' compensation claim in the twenty-two months
 before the statute-of-limitations period on her claim lapsed. 
On October 2, 2009, Defendants filed a motion to 
dismiss ("Motion to Dismiss") pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Civil 
Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 12(b)(6), arguing that Thomas's claims were barred by the six-year statute of limitations in Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 657-1.
3 Defendants argued that Thomas 
knew or should have known that her work-injury claims were barred 
3/
 HRS § 657-1 states, in part:
 
The following actions shall be commenced within six years
next after the cause of action accrued, and not after:
 
(1) Actions for the recovery of any debt founded upon any
contract, obligation, or liability, excepting such as are
brought upon the judgment or decree of a court; excepting
further that actions for the recovery of any debt founded
upon any contract, obligation, or liability made pursuant to
chapter 577A shall be governed by chapter 577A;
 
. . . .
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 657-1 (1993).
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at least as of April 3, 2003, meaning that her cause of action
 
accrued more than six years prior to the July 28, 2009 filing of
 the Complaint. 
In opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, Thomas argued
 
that the six-year limitations period "did not accrue and was
 tolled during the pendency of the appeal process" of [Thomas I],
 the period, she argued, between the April 3, 2003 LIRAB decision
 and January 22, 2007, when Thomas's "right to appeal to the U.S.
 Supreme Court expired." Referencing Scott v. Henriques, 20 Haw.
 370 (Haw. Terr. 1911), for the proposition that "no action lies
 on a judgment pending appeal[,]" Thomas argued that before
 January 22, 2007, the injury suffered as a result of the alleged
 malpractice was inchoate because the LIRAB decision was not
 final. Thomas also argued, as she does now on appeal, that she
 could have been liable to Defendants for malicious prosecution if
 the LIRAB decision had been reversed and that Sterns fraudulently
 concealed his malpractice from Thomas. 
C.	 Memorandum of Decision, Order Granting Motion to
Dismiss, and Final Judgment
 
On March 11, 2010, the Circuit Court filed a Memorandum
 
of Decision on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Filed on October 2,
 
2010, in which the court concluded that the statute of
 limitations for Thomas's malpractice action began to run on
 April 3, 2003, and that appellate review of the LIRAB decision
 did not toll the limitations period. The Circuit Court
 distinguished Henriques on the grounds that the case involved a
 statute that automatically stayed execution of or action on a
 judgment pending appeal, whereas Thomas's appeal from the LIRAB
 decision was subject to HRS § 91-14(c), which "clearly state[s]
 that there is no stay of an agency decision unless the court
 hearing the appeal orders a stay." The Circuit Court concluded
 that "[t]here was no legal impediment for [Thomas to file] a
 malpractice claim after the Appeals Board decision was rendered
 and an appeal to that decision noticed." 
The Circuit Court entered its Order Granting Motion to
 
Dismiss on March 29, 2010, and its Final Judgment on all claims
 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in favor of Defendants on April 16, 2010. This appeal followed. 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
"We review a trial court's ruling on a motion to
 
dismiss under HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) de novo." Justice v. Fuddy, 125
 
Hawai'i 104, 107, 253 P.3d 665, 668 (App. 2011). 
A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to
state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the
plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her
claim that would entitle him or her to relief. We must
 therefore view a plaintiff's complaint in a light most
favorable to him or her in order to determine whether the
 allegations contained therein could warrant relief under any
alternative theory. For this reason, in reviewing a circuit
court's order dismissing a complaint, our consideration is
strictly limited to the allegations of the complaint, and we
must deem those allegations to be true.
 
Id. at 107–08, 253 P.3d at 668–69 (quoting In re Estate of 
Rogers, 103 Hawai' i 275, 280-81, 81 P.3d 1190, 1195-96 (2003)) 
(internal brackets omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. Conditions of our review
 
A motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that 
the cause of action is barred by a statue of limitations is 
treated as an HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and can be granted when the validity of the affirmative defense "is apparent from the face of the pleading." See Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. State, 110 Hawai' i 338, 364, 
133 P.3d 767, 793 (2006) (quoting Romero v. Star Mkts., Ltd., 82 Hawai'i 405, 416, 922 P.2d 1018, 1029 (App. 1996)). Here, 
however, the Circuit Court relied upon documents outside of the complaint in granting the motion.
4 
The Circuit Court did not specify whether it granted
 
Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) or
 whether the motion was converted to one for summary judgment, and
 we were not provided with a transcript of the hearing at which
 
4/
 We know this because the Circuit Court found that "the statute of
 
limitation for the malpractice action . . . started to run on April 3, 2003,
the date of the [LIRAB] decision," despite the fact that the date of the entry
of the LIRAB decision is not alleged in the Complaint. Instead, the date of
the LIRAB decision is found in various exhibits attached to Defendants' motion
 
to dismiss, including a copy of our summary disposition order in Thomas I. 
5
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the court may have explained its thinking. See Haw. R. Civ. P.
 
12(b) (if "matters outside the pleading are presented to and not
 
excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for
 summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56"). 
Neither party objected to the Circuit Court's treatment of the
 matter and both parties agree that we should apply HRCP Rule 12
 on appeal. 
We hold that it was proper for the Circuit Court to
 
consider extraneous documents in ruling on the Motion to Dismiss
 in this case because the date of the LIRAB decision is found in
 our order in Thomas I, which Thomas referred to in the Complaint. 
See Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy Partners, 682 F.3d 687, 690
 (7th Cir. 2012) (no conversion if document referred to in the
 complaint); cf. Ellis v. Crocket, 51 Haw. 45, 55, 451 P.2d 814,
 821 (1969) (holding that collateral estoppel is properly raised
 under HRCP Rule 12(b)(6) where it "appears from the face of the
 complaint or from the taking of judicial notice or prior
 interrelated proceedings which are alluded to in the complaint").
 
Therefore, our task is to examine whether Thomas states
 
a claim upon which relief can be granted. As such, the question
 is whether the allegations of the Complaint coupled with the
 exhibits attached to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss that were
 referred to in the Complaint establish that Thomas's legal-
malpractice claim is barred by the statute of limitations.
5
 
B. Distinguishing "accrual" from "tolling"
 
We begin by noting that Thomas's arguments appear in 
places to conflate the concepts of accrual and tolling. When a 
cause of action "accrues," statute-of-limitation time periods begin to run. See H
AW. REV. STAT. § 657-1 (1993); Vidinha v. 
Miyaki, 112 Hawai' i 336, 341, 145 P.3d 879, 884 (App. 2006). 
5/
 Defendants objected to Thomas's opening brief, arguing that it did
not comply with Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b). As 
Thomas's point of error challenges a trial court's ruling on a motion to
dismiss, we will not dismiss Thomas's appeal for failure to comply with HRAPRule 28(b)(3) and (4) because the record is small and it is obvious where theerror was thought to have occurred and where that alleged error was brought tothe court's attention. Therefore, we address the merits of Thomas's arguments. 
6
   
 
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Once the statute of limitations begins to run, tolling stops its
 
running. See Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage
 
884 (2d ed. 1995) ("In the context of time limits—esp. statutes
 of limitation—toll means 'to abate' or 'to stop the running of
 (the statutory period).'").
 
Thomas's point of error states that the Circuit Court
 
erred in holding that the limitations period for her legal-
malpractice claims was not tolled during the pendency of appeal
 from the adverse decision of the LIRAB. Her first argument,
 however, is that her claim could not accrue until the LIRAB
 decision was "final and conclusive"—that is, until the completion
 of the appellate process. See H
AW. REV. STAT. § 386-88 (Supp.
 
2010). We will address the substance of Thomas's first argument:
 that her legal-malpractice claim did not accrue until the
 appellate process stemming from her underlying workers'
 compensation claim concluded.
6
 
C.	 Thomas's legal-malpractice causes of action accrued, at
the latest, upon issuance of the LIRAB's Decision and
Order and did not thereafter toll
 
Claims falling under HRS § 657-1 "shall be commenced 
within six years next after the cause of action accrued, and not 
after[.]" H
AW. REV. STAT. § 657-1. Because HRS § 657-1 is the 
applicable statute of limitations for legal-malpractice claims in Hawai'i, see Higa v. Mirikitani, 55 Haw. 167, 172–73, 517 P.2d 1, 
4–6 (1973), a legal-malpractice claim must be brought within six years of the accrual of the cause of action. 
The accrual of a legal-malpractice claim in Hawai' i is 
determined by application of the discovery rule. Blair v. Ing, 
95 Hawai' i 247, 264, 267, 21 P.3d 452, 469, 472 (2001). As a 
result, the statute of limitations on a legal-malpractice claim does not accrue until the plaintiff discovers, or should have 
6/
 Thomas’s second argument is that Defendants' fraud and concealment
"toll[ed] the limitations period." Even if Defendants' fraud and concealment
 
was on-going, however, the underlying facts became an unquestioned matter of
public record at the time of the LIRAB's April 3, 2003 decision. Because we
 conclude below that Thomas's malpractice claim accrued at least by April 3,
2003, any fraud or concealment could neither have tolled the limitations
period nor delayed the accrual of her malpractice claims beyond that date.
Consequently, we focus our attention on Thomas's first argument.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
reasonably discovered, facts sufficient to establish: that "(1) 
the parties had an attorney-client relationship, (2) the defendant committed a negligent act or omission constituting breach of that duty, (3) there is a causal connection between the breach and the plaintiff's injury, and (4) the plaintiff suffered actual loss or damages." Thomas v. Kidani, 126 Hawai' i 125, 129, 
267 P.3d 1230, 1234 (2011). 
Thomas argues that Defendants' negligence did not cause
 
actionable injury until there was a final judicial determination
 that her application to reopen her workers' compensation case was
 denied because of the statute of limitations because, until that
 point, any injury was inchoate and she could not, therefore,
 "discover" the injury. Our analysis is complicated by the fact
 that case law on this subject varies greatly from jurisdiction to
 jurisdiction. See 3 Ronald E. Mallen & Jeffrey M. Smith, Legal
 
Malpractice § 23:12, at 457 (2011 ed.) [hereinafter "Legal
 Malpractice"] ("Although the courts continue to address the
 various issues involving the determination of when injury and
 damage occurs for the purposes of the accrual of a statute of
 limitations, the inconsistency between and, even within,
 jurisdictions underscores the need for careful analysis."). 
Because of these variations, we look to Ronald E. Mallen and
 Jeffrey M. Smith's ("Mallen and Smith") treatise, Legal
 Malpractice, which the Supreme Court repeatedly cited in Blair,
 for assistance.
 
Mallen and Smith identify four alternative dates that
 
might be used to measure when the injury occurs in a legal
 malpractice case involving counsel's failure to file a timely
 claim: (i) when the underlying action was barred; (ii) when the
 opposing party raises the statute of limitations defense; (iii)
 when the underlying action is dismissed; or (iv) when an appeal
 is concluded. 3 Legal Malpractice § 23:12, at 430. In this
 
7
case, the underlying action was barred on December 30, 1996;  the
fact that the statute of limitations barred reopening of the case
 
7/
 Thomas received her final workers' compensation payment on
December 29, 1988.
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was brought to Thomas's attention no later than April 3, 2003;8 
the underlying action was dismissed no later than April 3, 2003;9 
and the appeal was concluded on October 24, 2006, when the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court filed its order denying certiorari review 
of our decision in the underlying case.10 Mallen and Smith argue 
in favor of the first alternative, but recognize merit in the third. Thomas champions the fourth alternative. 
Noting that the remedy is lost in a failure-to-file
 
case because of the bar of the statute of limitations, Mallen and
 Smith argue that "[t]he injury occurred when the client's action
 was legally subject to dismissal, rather than the actual, but
 fortuitous, date of dismissal." Id. at 430–31. Still, they
 
recognize that the dismissal by the court "can be a critical
 event in a discovery rule jurisdiction because it provides notice
 that a client otherwise may not have." Id. at 431. In certain
 
cases, the client might not be able make a damage claim until the
 action was dismissed, although Mallen and Smith observe that the
 client can establish in the legal-malpractice action that the
 claim was barred, even without a dismissal. Id.
 
Mallen and Smith cite to numerous jurisdictions that
 
apply the first and third alternative dates in failure-to-file
 cases, but none in support of the fourth, conclusion-of-the­appeal, alternative. 3 Legal Malpractice § 23:12, at 430–36. 
"An action barred by a statute of limitations need not first be
 pursued through futile litigation before a legal malpractice is
 brought. The injury occurred when the client's action was
 legally subject to dismissal, rather than the actual, but
 
8/
 The Circuit Court found that "the statute of limitation for the
 
malpractice action . . . started to run on April 3, 2003, the date of the
[LIRAB] action." Therefore the fact of the statute and its effect was brought
to Thomas's attention no later than that date.
 
9/
 Arguably, the underlying action was dismissed when the Director
first denied Thomas's request to re-open her workers' compensation claim on
May 21, 2001, but as the administrative process did not terminate until the
LIRAB issued its decision, we will use that date as representing the latest
date by which the underlying action was dismissed.
 
10/
 Thomas contends that the appeal was only truly concluded on
January 22, 2007, when she claims her "right to appeal" to the U.S. Supreme
Court expired. Thomas, however, had no right to appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court.

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
fortuitous, date of dismissal." Id. at 430–31. If the rule were
 
otherwise, the client would never suffer an injury until a
 
subsequent attorney filed a new lawsuit to assert a "facially
 groundless claim," a matter solely within the client's control. 
See Wesson v. McCleave, Roberts, Shields & Green, 810 So. 2d 652,
 661 (Ala. 2001) (Lyons, J., concurring) (noting the distinction
 between malpractice claims that arose in an on-going action and
 were therefore incapable of determination until a finding was
 made by a jury or a ruling by a trial or appellate court versus
 claims that arose outside the litigation). 
In this case, Thomas suffered actual injury on April 3, 
2003, the date the LIRAB held that Thomas's request to reopen was barred as untimely due to a lapsed statute of limitations. "[M]ost courts have concluded that a cause of action for presently identifiable damages is not suspended pending an appeal or motion by the injured party." 3 Legal Malpractice § 23:12, at 436 ("an existing injury does not disappear or become suspended, while a more final adjudication of the result is sought"); see also Adams v. Paul, 904 P.2d at 1211 n.4 (Cal. 1995) (plurality opinion) (actual injury not conditioned on "irremediability"); cf. Office of Hawaiian Affairs v. State, 110 Hawai' i at 361 n.21, 
133 P.3d at 790 n.21 (in the personal-injury context, "the statute of limitations begins to run when at least some damage is suffered and not when the full development of damages occurs or the ultimate effect of the breach of duty is known").
11 
11/
 Thomas cites to Scott v. Henriques, 20 Haw. 370 (Haw. Terr. 1911)
for the proposition that "it has been long settled[] that a limitations period
is tolled pending completion of an appeal process." Thomas, however,
 
overstates Scott's holding. Scott stands for the proposition that the statute
of limitations on a collections action based on an underlying judgment did not
run during an appeal from the underlying judgment because a plaintiff could
not levy execution on that judgment pursuant to the statutes in effect at that
time.
 
A legal-malpractice claim is unlike an entitlement to collect on
an underlying judgment. The latter is governed by statutes (as evidenced in
Scott) while the former is not. In addition, while the attorney's alleged
failure to file here occurred prior to and independent of the underlying
action (filing to re-open Thomas's workers' compensation claim), the
plaintiff's entitlement to collect in Scott was dependent on resolution of the
underlying action (establishing the defendant's liability). Therefore, Scott
 
is inapposite to this case. The bulk of the other cases cited by Thomas do
not involve legal-malpractice causes of action or are foreign cases concerning
attorney errors that occurred during the litigation of the underlying claim.
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Applying discovery principles to this case, Thomas's 
legal-malpractice claim, at the latest, accrued on April 3, 2003, 
the date of the LIRAB's Decision and Order, because on that date Thomas had "knowledge of those facts which are necessary for an actionable claim before the statute begins to run." See Hays, 81 
Hawai'i at 398, 917 P.2d at 725 (quoting Yamaguchi, 65 Haw. at 90 
n.10, 684 P.2d at 694 n.10). As a failure-to-file legal-malpractice claim, Thomas's claim was not incohate until discretionary appeals on the underlying action were complete. Rather, Thomas necessarily discovered her entitlement to the legal-malpractice claim on or before April 3, 2003, and, therefore, her claim accrued at that point. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
We conclude that Thomas's claim for legal-malpractice 
accrued no later than April 3, 2003, and that the six year 
statute of limitations set out in HRS § 657-1 was not tolled during the pendency of Thomas's subsequent appeals of the underlying case to this court or the Hawai' i Supreme Court. 
Therefore, the April 16, 2010 Final Judgment and the March 29, 2010 Order Granting Motion to Dismiss are affirmed.
