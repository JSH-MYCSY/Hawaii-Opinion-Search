APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2007-142 (2-05-10623) (2-06-06908))
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this workers' compensation case, Claimant/Appellee-
Appellant pro se Donna W. Kuehu (Kuehu) appeals from the Decision 
and Order (D&O) filed on February 26, 2010 by the State of 
Hawai'i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB). In 
its D&O, LIRAB reversed the March 19, 2007 Decision of the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations (the Director); the 
Director had found in favor of Kuehu and against Self-Insured 
Employer/Appellant-Appellee United Airlines, Inc. (United 
Airlines) and Third-Party Administrator/Appellant-Appellee 
Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc. (Gallagher Bassett) 
(collectively, United Airlines or UA). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Kuehu raises the following points of error on appeal:
 
(1) LIRAB erred in Findings of Fact (FOFs) 36, 37, 47,
 
and 48.
 
(2) LIRAB erred in Conclusion of Law (COL) 1, when it
 
found that Kuehu had not sustained a personal injury on
 January 25, 2006 arising out of and in the course of her
 
employment and instead found that Kuehu's condition was an
 
undifferentiated somatoform disorder.
 
(3) LIRAB erred in COL 2, when it found that Kuehu was
 
not entitled to temporary total disability (TTD).
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 22, 2005, Kuehu allegedly was injured while
 
working at the United Airlines Reservations Center (Reservations
 
Center) when "sewer gases seep[ed] through bathroom area walls,"
 
exposing her to toxic fumes. On November 4, 2005, Kuehu filed a
 
Form WC-5 "Employee's Claim for Workers' Compensation Benefits"
 
(2005 Claim), alleging she had suffered "headache, dizziness,
 
forgetfulness, poor vision, difficult concentration, nausea,
 
[and] diarrhea" as a result of the toxic fumes. Dr. Agles
 
conducted a medical record review concerning the 2005 Claim. 
Dr. Agles noted that Dr. Seberg had examined Kuehu on August 23,
 
2005, the day after the exposure, and the "[c]linical examination
 
was normal except for a cold sore." Dr. Agles also noted that
 
Dr. Seberg had indicated that Kuehu suffered from "chronic
 
fibromyalgia-like symptoms," but did not associate the cause of
 
the symptoms to the exposure to sewer gases. Dr. Agles concluded
 
that Kuehu's "current symptoms are not related to the incident on
 
8/22/05."
 
Even so, Gallagher Bassett filed a letter with the
 
Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Disability
 
Compensation Division, indicating that United Airlines accepted
 
"limited liability" for the 2005 Claim and agreed to pay for
 
Kuehu's medical treatment from August 22, 2005 through August 29,
 
2005. The claim came up for review before the Director on
 
January 12, 2006, who entered a Decision on February 10, 2006,
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
concluding that United Airlines had "voluntarily accepted"
 
Kuehu's 2005 Claim as a compensable injury and ordering United
 
Airlines to pay medical and temporary total disability (TTD)
 
benefits. Whether there was any permanent disability and/or
 
disfigurement was left to be determined at a later date. Neither
 
party appealed from the Director's February 10, 2006 Decision. 
On May 5, 2006, Kuehu submitted a letter asking for a
 
recalculation of her average weekly wage. On June 9, 2006, the
 
Director issued an Amended Decision, awarding Kuehu TTD benefits
 
of $355.41.
 
In the meantime, Kuehu allegedly suffered another work-
related injury on January 25, 2006, caused by exposure to toxic
 
fumes from sewer gases. On July 25, 2006, Kuehu filed a WC-5
 
"Employee's Claim for Workers' Compensation Benefits" (2006
 
Claim), alleging a "[r]e-occurrence of exposure to toxic fumes." 
Kuehu described her symptoms as "[h]eadache, dizziness, brain
 
swelling, mouth sore, skin blisters, nerve twitches, muscle ache
 
& stiffness, exhaustion, fatigue, heart palpitations, [and] liver
 
[problems]."
 
On August 29, 2006, Kuehu filed another WC-5 claim
 
"[a]sserting statutory rights" and requesting consolidation of
 
the 2006 Claim with the 2005 Claim. On January 9, 2007, she
 
filed an amended WC-5 claim, adding "stress" to her list of
 
injuries.
 
The two claims were consolidated and heard by the
 
Hearings Officer on January 30, 2007. The issues to be
 
determined were whether Kuehu had (1) sustained a recurrence of
 
the 2005 injury, (2) sustained a work-related injury on January
 
25, 2006, and (3) received TDI benefits after January 25, 2006. 
On March 19, 2007, the Director issued a Decision that determined
 
Kuehu had sustained a new work-related injury on January 25,
 
2006. The Director credited the opinions of Dr. Seberg and
 
Dr. Ewing that Kuehu had been exposed to toxic fumes at work that
 
led to her illness. The Director awarded medical care and
 
services "as the nature of the 1/25/2006 injury may require" and
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
TTD benefits of $34,288.28 for the period from January 29, 2006
 
through January 30, 2007.
 
United Airlines appealed to LIRAB from the Director's
 
March 19, 2007 Decision. On February 26, 2010, LIRAB issued the
 
D&O, reversing the Director's March 19, 2007 Decision. LIRAB
 
determined Kuehu had not suffered a work-related injury on
 
January 25, 2006 and was not entitled to TTD benefits.
 
On March 25, 2010, Kuehu filed a "Motion for
 
Reconsideration or Reopening of [D&O] filed February 26, 2010." 
LIRAB filed its "Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration" on
 
March 31, 2010. On April 26, 2010, Kuehu timely appealed to this
 
court.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Deference to Administrative Agencies 
In determining whether an agency determination should
be given deference, the standard to be applied is as
follows:
 
[W]hen reviewing a determination of an administrative
agency, we first decide whether the legislature
granted the agency discretion to make the
determination being reviewed. If the legislature has
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then we review the agency's action pursuant to
the deferential abuse of discretion standard (bearing
in mind that the legislature determines the boundaries
of that discretion). If the legislature has not
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then the agency's conclusions are subject to
de novo review.
 
Paul's Electrical Service, Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai' i 412,
419-20, 91 P.3d 494, 501-[02] (2004). 
Olelo: The Corp. for Cmty. Television v. Office of Info. 
Practices
, 116 Hawai' i 337, 344, 173 P.3d 484, 491 (2007). 
Appellate review of a LIRAB decision is governed by
HRS ยง 91-14(g) (1993), which states that: 
Upon review of the record the court may affirm the
decision of the agency or remand the case with
instructions for further proceedings; or it may
reverse or modify the decision and order if the
substantial rights of the petitioners may have been
prejudiced because the administrative findings,
conclusions, decisions, or orders are: 
(1)
 In violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions; or 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(2) In excess of the statutory authority or
jurisdiction of the agency; or
(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or
(4) Affected by other error of law; or
(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,
probative, and substantial evidence on the whole
record; or
(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized
by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted
exercise of discretion.
 
We have previously stated: 
FOFs are reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard to
determine if the agency decision was clearly erroneous in
view of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the
whole record. 
COLs are freely reviewable to determine if the
agency's decision was in violation of constitutional or
statutory provisions, in excess of statutory authority or
jurisdiction of agency, or affected by other error of law.
 
A COLS that presents mixed questions of fact and law
is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because the
conclusion is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of
the particular case. When mixed questions of law and fact
are presented, an appellate court must give deference to the
agency's expertise and experience in the particular field.
The court should not substitute its own judgment for that of
the agency.
 
Igawa v. Koa House Rest., 97 Hawai' i 402, 405-06, 38 P.3d 570, 
573-74 (2001) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets
 
in original omitted) (quoting In re Water Use Permit
 
Applications, 94 Hawai' i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000)). 
An FOF or a mixed determination of law and fact is
 
clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial
evidence to support the finding or determination, or (2)
despite substantial evidence to support the finding or
determination, the appellate court is left with the definite
and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. We have
 defined "substantial evidence" as credible evidence which is
 of sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person
of reasonable caution to support a conclusion.

431 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. LIRAB did not err in FOFs 36, 37, 47, and 48.
 
The appellate court reviews an administrative agency's
 
FOFs under the clearly erroneous standard. Igawa, 97 Hawai' i at 
406, 38 P.3d at 574. An FOF "is clearly erroneous when (1) the
 
record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding or
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
determination, or (2) despite substantial evidence to support the 
finding or determination, the appellate court is left with the 
definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made." In 
re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai' i at 119, 9 P.3d at 
431. "Ordinarily, deference will be given to decisions of 
administrative agencies acting within the realm of their expertise." Coon v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 98 Hawai' i 233, 
245, 47 P.3d 348, 360 (2002) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
Kuehu disputes the following FOFs:
 
36.	 The Board credits the opinions of Drs. Agles,
Direnfeld, and Goodyear, that [Kuehu's] condition is
an undifferentiated somatoform disorder, over the
opinions of Drs. Ewing and Seberg that [Kuehu] has
multiple chemical sensitivity, chronic pain syndrome,
fibromyalgia, or candidiasis.
 
37.	 The Board also finds that the undifferentiated
 somatoform disorder is not a personal injury that
arose out of and in the course of employment on either
January 25, 2006 or August 22, 2005.
 
* *  *
 
47.	 The Board applied the statutory presumption and finds
that Employer has presented substantial evident [sic]
to rebut or overcome the presumption of
compensability.
 
48.	 The Board finds [Kuehu's] disability from work, if
any, was not attributable to a compensable work
injury, but, rather, a non-compensable somatoform
disorder, as diagnosed by Dr. Direnfeld, Dr. Agles,
and Dr. Goodyear.
 
Kuehu does not challenge the Board's FOF 35 that found 
she "was not exposed to medically significant amounts of 
[hydrogen sulfide], and was not exposed to such gas for an 
extended period of time on January 25, 2006." Generally, 
findings that are not challenged on appeal are binding upon this 
court and "are the operative facts of a case." Robert's Hawaii 
Sch. Bus, Inc. v. Laupahoehoe Transp. Co., 91 Hawai' i 224, 239, 
982 P.2d 853, 868 (1999), superseded by statute on other grounds 
as recognized in Haw. Med. Ass'n v. Haw. Med. Serv. Ass'n, 113 
Hawai'i 77, 107, 148 P.3d 1179, 1209 (2006). Therefore, it is 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
taken as fact that Kuehu was not exposed to a medically
 
significant amount of toxic fumes.
 
Additionally, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 386-85 
(1993) provides that where compensability of an injury is at 
issue, there is a rebuttable presumption that the injury is work-
related. The employer may rebut the presumption by presenting 
substantial evidence to show otherwise. Flor v. Holguin, 94 
Hawai'i 70, 79, 9 P.3d 382, 391 (2000). United Airlines 
presented evidence of air quality tests of the Reservations 
Center conducted by the Honolulu Fire Department; United 
Airline's industrial hygienist; Environomics South West, LLC; and 
the Hawaii Occupational Safety and Health Division. The tests 
showed either no detectable level of hydrogen sulfide or a level 
within permissible exposure levels. 
Furthermore, "the credibility of witnesses and the 
weight to be given their testimony are within the province of the 
trier of fact and, generally, will not be disturbed on appeal." 
Tamashiro v. Control Specialist, Inc., 97 Hawai' i 86, 92, 34 P.3d 
16, 22 (2001). United Airlines presented evidence from several medical experts who opined that Kuehu's alleged symptoms were not 
caused by exposure to toxic fumes. LIRAB credited the opinions 
of Dr. Agles, Dr. Direnfeld, and Dr. Goodyear and did not credit 
the opinions of Kuehu's treating physicians, Dr. Seberg and 
Dr. Ewing. 
Dr. Agles prepared a records review report on
 
October 28, 2005 regarding Kuehu's 2005 Claim. In Dr. Angles'
 
report, she acknowledged there had been a low level transient
 
release of sewer gases in Kuehu's work area restroom. She also
 
noted that the Honolulu Fire Department HAZMAT team had found no
 
detectable levels of hydrogen sulfide gas. Dr. Angles opined
 
that, other than the noxious "rotten egg sewer gas" smell, there
 
was "no significant chemical exposure that has resulted in any
 
need for disability from work."
 
In a supplemental report made after the Director
 
determined that United Airlines had "voluntarily accepted the
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
[August 22, 2005] work injury," Dr. Agles disagreed with the
 
Director's February 10, 2006 Decision, noting again that the
 
HAZMAT team had found "no detectable levels of hydrogen sulfide
 
gas." She also cited statistics from the Poison Control Center
 
in Denver that indicated that at low levels, hydrogen sulfide gas
 
is merely a noxious, rotten egg smell, but is not harmful.
 
Dr. Agles examined Kuehu on July 12, 2006, based on
 
Kuehu's 2006 Claim. Dr. Agles noted that Kuehu's "subjective
 
complaints are diffuse, odd, and unsubstantiated by the clinical
 
examination," which was "completely normal, except for abnormal
 
cerebellar findings" unrelated to her workers' compensation
 
complaint. Using a "pain diagram" to note the reported areas of
 
pain, Dr. Agles concluded that the results were "most consistent
 
1
with a somatoform pain disorder,  and would be completely
inconsistent with an alleged exposure to low level hydrogen
 
sulfide gas (which has not been borne out with repeat air
 
sampling)." Dr. Agles concluded: "I would disagree with any
 
1
 Undisputed FOF 28 provides Dr. Direnfeld's description of the
diagnosis of somatoform disorder as presented in his November 28, 2007 report,
citing to the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria:
 
A.	 One or more physical complaints (i.e., fatigue, loss of
appetite, gastrointestinal or urinary complaints).
 
B.	 (1) or (2):
1.	 After appropriate investigation the symptoms cannot be
fully explained by a known general medical condition
or the direct effects of a substance.
 
2.	 When there is a related general medical condition, the
physical complaints or resulting social or
occupational impairment is in excess of what would be
expected from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings.
 
C.	 The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
in functioning.
 
D.	 The duration of the disturbance is at least six months.
 
E.	 The disturbance is not better accounted for by another
mental disorder (i.e., another somatoform disorder, sexual
dysfunction, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, sleep
disorder, or psychotic disorder).
 
F.	 The symptom is not intentionally produced or feigned (as in
factitious disorder or malingering).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
provider that finds [Kuehu] medically disabled based upon her
 
subjective complaints, which are unsubstantiated clinically or by
 
objective testing either of the patient or the workplace."
 
Dr. Direnfeld prepared a records review report on
 
September 24, 2007, examined Kuehu on November 20, 2007, and
 
prepared a subsequent report on November 28, 2007. He, too,
 
diagnosed Kuehu with an undifferentiated somatoform disorder.
 
Dr. Goodyear conducted an independent pyschological
 
examination of Kuehu, and in his December 17, 2007 report, he
 
also diagnosed Kuehu with an undifferentiated somatoform
 
disorder. He noted that there was no objective evidence that
 
Kuehu was exposed to toxic levels of hydrogen sulfide and
 
concluded that Kuehu had not suffered any "brain-related
 
impairment" in cognitive functioning. Dr. Goodyear also noted
 
Kuehu was functioning normally in other areas of her life,
 
including her community college courses.
 
LIRAB did not credit the opinions of Dr. Seberg and
 
Dr. Ewing. Dr. Seberg noted in his January 25, 2006 examination
 
of Kuehu that "[s]he is now not complaining of anything in
 
particular, but every thing in general." In his February 24,
 
2006 report, Dr. Seberg noted that Kuehu was "very anxious" and
 
claimed that alleged "skin disease, asthma, sinusitis, and mental
 
lapses" were side effects of the sewer gas exposure. Kuehu
 
expressed concern about some "very small red spots" on her leg
 
and arm that she claimed she did not have before the exposure,
 
but Dr. Seberg did not believe there was a causal relationship. 
Dr. Seberg also noted that Kuehu "has become very obsessed by
 
this [sewer gas exposure] and seems to think of nothing else." 
On March 24, 2006, he noted that Kuehu "can easily pass a mini
 
mental status exam," but that she claimed "it is impossible for
 
her to remember, she has to write things down, and that she has
 
times when she lapses into a dazed state."
 
Dr. Ewing evaluated Kuehu on March 17, 2006 and
 
diagnosed her with "chemical sensitivity" due to chemical
 
exposures. He noted in a letter to the referring doctor,
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dr. DeBoard, that Kuehu "had persistent and recurrent symptoms"
 
related to "toxic chemical sensitivity and chemical reaction"
 
since 1999 when she began work at the Reservations Center. In a
 
letter dated February 14, 2008, Dr. Ewing opined that Kuehu "has
 
the residuals of multiple chemical sensitivity, fibromyalgia, and
 
chronic fatigue syndrome" originating "from [Kuehu's] work
 
exposures while working at the United Airlines office."
 
We conclude that United Airlines presented reliable,
 
probative, and substantial evidence to support LIRAB's
 
determination that Kuehu had not suffered a compensable work-
related injury. LIRAB's finding that Kuehu's condition was "an
 
undifferentiated somatoform disorder" and was "not a personal
 
injury that arose out of and in the course of employment on
 
January 25, 2006 " was not clearly erroneous.
 
B. LIRAB did not err in COLs 1 and 2.
 
COLs 1 and 2 are mixed questions of fact and law that 
we review under the clearly erroneous standard because the 
conclusion that Kuehu did not sustain a personal work-related 
injury is dependent upon the facts of this case. Igawa, 97 
Hawai'i at 406, 38 P.3d at 574. "When mixed questions of law and 
fact are presented, an appellate court must give deference to the 
agency's expertise and experience in the particular field. The 
court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the 
agency." Id. (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets 
omitted) (quoting In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai' i 
at 119, 9 P.3d at 431). 
LIRAB concluded the following, in relevant part:
 
1.	 The Board concludes that [Kuehu] did not sustain a
personal injury on January 25, 2006, arising out of
and in the course of employment. [Kuehu's] condition
is an undifferentiated somatoform disorder, and not
multiple chemical sensitivity, chronic pain syndrome,
fibromyalgia, or candidiasis. 
Although [Kuehu] may have been exposed to an
unpleasant smell on January 25, 2006, results from
testing for such odors were below a level that could
be measured. Crediting the opinions of Dr. Agles,
Dr. Direnfeld, and Dr. Goodyear, the Board concludes
that [Kuehu's] reported symptoms are not consistent
with exposure at such insignificant concentrations or
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
low levels, and are not substantiated either
clinically or by the medical literature.
 
Further, although [Kuehu] attended an office
visit on January 25, 2006, Dr. Seberg's treatment
notes do not reflect that anything clinically
significant occurred on that date. [Kuehu's] next
visit to Dr. Seberg was February 24, 2006, at which
time she reported that she had been experiencing
symptoms for one day. 
The presumption of compensability has been
rebutted or overcome by substantial evidence to the
contrary.
 
Based upon the expert opinions of Drs. Agles,
Direnfeld, and Goodyear, the Board concludes that
[Kuehu's] condition is an undifferentiated somatoform
disorder, and not multiple chemical sensitivity,
chronic pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, or candidiasis.
 
* *	  *
 
2.	 Given the foregoing, the Board further concludes that
[Kuehu] is not entitled to temporary total disability.
 
Kuehu argues that LIRAB erred in not crediting the
 
opinion of Dr. Direnfeld and Dr. Ewing as to her January 25, 2006
 
alleged injury. Dr. Direnfeld testified at the April 11, 2008
 
hearing that if Kuehu had been exposed to hydrogen sulfide and
 
experienced symptoms on January 25, 2006, she would have suffered
 
a work injury on that day. However, as previously indicated,
 
LIRAB found that Kuehu had not been exposed to a detectable,
 
injury-producing level of hydrogen sulfide, so Dr. Direnfeld's
 
testimony did not support a finding of injury.
 
LIRAB did not credit Dr. Ewing's opinion. As 
previously noted, "the credibility of witnesses and the weight to 
be given their testimony are within the province of the trier of 
fact and, generally, will not be disturbed on appeal." 
Tamashiro, 97 Hawai' i at 92, 34 P.3d at 22. 
We do not disturb LIRAB's decision as to the weight it
 
gave the witnesses' testimony and reports; therefore, LIRAB's
 
conclusion that Kuehu failed to show she had suffered a work-
related injury on January 25, 2006 was not clearly erroneous. 
Furthermore, because COL 1 was not clearly erroneous, LIRAB did
 
not err in COL 2 when it concluded that Kuehu was not entitled to
 
TTD.
