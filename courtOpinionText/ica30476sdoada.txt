IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
In the Matter of Attorney's Fees Pertaining to
LIONEL D. MEYER, Appellee,
in the case of
 
TYRONE L. THORN, Claimant-Appellant,
v.
 
SURE SAVE SUPER MARKET, Employer-Appellee,
and
 
ISLAND INSURANCE COMPANY, Insurance Carrier-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND
 
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2009-546(H) (1-06-01073))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In this secondary appeal from a workers' compensation
 
administrative proceeding, Tyrone L. Thorn (Thorn) appeals from
 
the March 31, 2010 Decision and Order (D&O) by the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB). The D&O affirmed the
 
October 26, 2009 "Approval of Attorney's Fees" (Decision) by
 
Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations'
 
(Director).  The Decision approved the "Request for Approval of
 
Attorney's Fee" dated October 6, 2009 (Request) by Thorn's former
 attorney, Lionel D. Meyer for attorney's fees and costs in the
 
amount of $6,712.52 as a lien against any award Thorn might
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
receive in the future for his workers' compensation claim
 
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 386-94 (Supp. 2011)1.
 
Meyer initially represented Thorn in this workers'
 
compensation matter. Their attorney-client relationship ended
 
prematurely, and although this matter had not yet concluded,
 
Meyer submitted his Request. On October 26, 2009, the Director
 
issued its Decision approving the Request. 
On November 2, 2009, Thorn appealed from the Decision
 
to the LIRAB. On March 31, 2010, LIRAB entered the D&O, which
 
affirmed the Decision approving the Request. Thorn timely filed
 
his appeal to this court.
 
On appeal, Thorn contends "The [LIRAB] Erred in Holding
 
that [Thorn's] Right to Due Process was not Violated Where
 
[Thorn] was not Properly Served with [Meyer's Request]."
 
The D&O reads in part:
 
1. The [LIRAB] concludes that [Thorn] was properly
served with a copy of [Meyer's Request], and that [Thorn's]
right to due process was not violated. As such, the [LIRAB]
does not reach the question as to whether the Director
should have disapproved [Meyer's] request.
 
Administrative Rule § 12-10-69(a) provides, in
relevant part:
 
(a) Within ten calendar days following the
filing of a final decision and order or upon the
filing of a stipulation and settlement
agreement, attorneys seeking approval of fees
and costs claims pursuant to section 386-94,
HRS, shall file with the department a request
for approval of attorney’s fees and costs
setting forth a detailed breakdown of the time
expended and costs incurred in each activity up
to and including the date of the decision. The
 request shall be served on those parties against
which the fees and costs claims are to be
 assessed. Any party objecting to approval of a
request may file written objections no later
than ten calendar days after service. No
 request for approval of attorney's fees and
costs claims or agreement to pay attorney's fees
and costs claims shall be valid until approved
by the director. . . . The director shall

to approve the fees of [Thorn's] attorney as a lien against [Thorn's] eventual
workers' compensation award.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
disapprove requests which are not served
properly or filed timely, except for good cause.
 
Chapter 10, Title 12 of the Administrative Rules
contains no definition of "service" or "proper service."
The [LIRAB] does not condone use of the Disability
Compensation Division as an intermediary for purposes of
service by the parties. However, given the acrimonious
relationship between [Thorn] and [Meyer] and/or his office,
[Meyer] made arrangements with the Disability Compensation
Division to provide [Thorn] with a box of materials. The
 Disability Compensation Divisions apparently agreed to
provide [Thorn] with the box. Given the totality of
circumstances and the situation in this case, such measures
were reasonable.
 
Although [Thorn] basically argues that [Meyer] did not
serve the Request by mail or hand delivery, and, therefore,
service was improper, [Thorn] had actual receipt of the
Request. The box contained [Meyer's] Request, but [Thorn]
did not look in the box of materials to ascertain its
 contents. Such decision by [Thorn] cannot be, and will not
be, held against [Meyer].
 
"Rules as to service of process, like rules as to
pleadings, should be construed with an eye to fairness
rather than literal construction." (Footnote omitted.) 7 A.
Larson, Larson's Workers' Compensation Law, § 124.05 (2009).
 
Further, the [LIRAB] notes that Rule § 12-10-69 does
not require an attorney to submit a Request for Approval of
Attorney's Fees until "ten calendar days following the
filing of a final decision and order or upon the filing of a
stipulation and settlement agreement . . . ." Therefore,
even if the [LIRAB] were to set aside the Director's
[Decision], the [LIRAB] would expect that it would only
result in an exercise in futility where [Meyer] could then
resubmit his fees[.]
 
Although the [LIRAB] does not reach the question as to
whether the Director should have disapproved [Meyer's]
request, the [LIRAB] notes that the Disability Compensation
Division should be able to rely upon the representation of a
licensed attorney, an officer of the court, that service was
made.
 
ORDER
 
The Director's approval dated October 6, 2009, is hereby not
set aside in accordance with the foregoing.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude LIRAB
 
erred in affirming the Decision approving the Request without

proper service. Placing a request for attorney fees and costs in
 
a box of other documents and having another party deliver the box
 
to the person to be served cannot, under any circumstances, be
 
considered proper service. The purpose of service is to put the
 
recipient of service on notice. There is no evidence that Thorn
 
was put on notice that the Request had been placed in the box and
 
was being served on him.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the March 31, 2010 Decision
 
and Order of the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board is
 vacated and this case is remanded to LIRAB for consideration of
 
Meyer's motion for attorney fees and costs and any objection
 
Thorn may have to said motion.
