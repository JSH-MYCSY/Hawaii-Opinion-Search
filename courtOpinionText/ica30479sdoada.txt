Defendants-Appellees Naleen Andrade, M.D. (Dr. Andrade),
 
Courtenay Matsu, M.D. (Dr. Matsu), and D. Christian Derauf, M.D.
 
(collectively, Individual Defendants), and against Jones as to
 
all asserted claims. All other claims by or against any party
 
were dismissed with prejudice.2
 
On appeal, Jones contends the circuit court erred when
 
it
 
(A) dismissed Dr. Andrade and Dr. Matsu in their
 
individual capacities because they intentionally and maliciously
 
sabotaged Jones's career and acted for their own personal
 
benefit;
 
(B) determined that any claims for events that
 
occurred prior to the January 13, 2005 contract expiration date
 
were barred by the statute of limitations;
 
(C) dismissed Jones's Intentional Infliction of
 
Emotional Distress claim;
 
(D) dismissed Jones's claims of Intentional
 
Interference of Contractual Relations and Prospective Economic
 
Advantage, which also prematurely dismissed HRP from the case;
 
(E) granted summary judgment to UH based on the false
 
premise that Jones was not in a contractual relationship with UH
 
and that HRP was an entity separate from UH; and
 
(F) held a bench trial when Jones had requested a jury
 
trial.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Jones's points of error and this appeal have no merit.
 
Therefore,

 Jones also filed her complaint against Terry Lee, M.D. (Dr. Lee) and
Iqbal Ahmed, M.D. (Dr. Ahmed), but did not allege a cause of action against
either of them in her Complaint, Revised Complaint, or Amended Complaint.
Jones served Dr. Lee with the Revised Complaint, but Dr. Lee did not file an
 answer. No proof of service upon Dr. Ahmed appears in the record.
