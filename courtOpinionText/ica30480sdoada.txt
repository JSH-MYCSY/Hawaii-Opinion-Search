STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 09-1-0040; CR. NO. 01-1-1154)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Arthur Birano (Birano) appeals
 
from the Order Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
 
Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody, filed on April
 
21, 2010, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit
 
Court).1
 
On September 9, 2009, Birano filed a second Petition to
 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner
 
from Custody (Second Petition). The Second Petition stated five
 
grounds for relief:
 
A. Ground One: The trial court violated my right to be
present at every stage of trial under the Hawai' i 
Rules of Penal Procedure, the Hawai' i Constitution and 
the United States Constitution. 
State supporting FACTS (do not cite cases or law): At
 
trial, codefendant and prosecution witness Nicolas
Nakano invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination. The trial court then conducted an
 improper ex parte in-chambers meeting with the

prosecutor, Nicolas Nakano, and Nakano's attorney.
Neither myself nor my attorney were present.
Following this improper ex parte communication, Nakano
then testified at length on behalf of the prosecution.
Subsequently, Nakano has indicated that the prosecutor
put pressure on him to testify and that his testimony
was not truthful (see attached Amended Declaration of
Nicolas Nakano).
 
Ground Two: The trial court violated my right to have
counsel present at all critical stage[s] of theproceedings under the Hawai� i Constitution and the 
United States Constitution. 
State supporting FACTS (do not cite cases or law): At
 
trial, codefendant and prosecution witness Nicolas
Nakano invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination. The trial court then conducted an
 improper ex parte in-chambers meeting with the
prosecutor, Nicolas Nakano, and Nakano's attorney.
Neither myself nor my attorney were present.
Following the improper ex parte communication, Nakano
then testified at length on behalf of the prosecution.
Subsequently, Nakano has indicated that the prosecutor
put pressure on him to testify and that his testimony
was not truthful (see attached Amended Declaration of
Nicolas Nakano).
 
Ground Three: The trial court violated my right to due
process under the United States Constitution by
precluding the disclosure of exculpatory and
impeachment evidence of one of the prosecution's key
witnesses.
 
State supporting FACTS (do not cite cases or law):
(Refer to supporting FACTS in Ground four)
 
Ground Four: The trial court violated my right under

State supporting FACTS (do not cite cases or law): At
 
trial, codefendant and prosecution witness Nicolas
Nakano invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination. The trial court then conducted an
 improper ex parte in-chambers meeting with the
prosecutor, Nicolas Nakano, and Nakano's attorney.

Following the improper ex parte communication, Nakano
then testified at length on behalf of the prosecution.
Subsequently, Nakano has indicated that the prosecutor
put pressure on him to testify and that his testimony
was not truthful (see attached Amended Declaration of

prosecutor's improper ex parte communication with key
witness Nicolas Nakano.

State supporting FACTS (do not cite cases or law): At
 
trial, codefendant and prosecution witness Nicolas
Nakano invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination. The trial court then conducted an
 improper ex parte in-chambers meeting with the
prosecutor, Nicolas Nakano, and Nakano's attorney.
Neither myself nor my attorney were present.
Following the improper ex parte communication, Nakano
then testified at length on behalf of the prosecution.
Subsequently, Nakano has indicated that the prosecutor
put pressure on him to testify and that his testimony
was not truthful (see attached Amended Declaration of
Nicolas Nakano). I never received any information
about the content of this improper ex parte meeting.
The prosecutor's improper meeting with Nakano and
refusal to provide any information about this meeting
constitutes misconduct.
 
Birano argued that he was raising these grounds for the
 
first time because:
 
On June 12, 2008, Nakano contacted my attorney Cynthia
Kagiwada. On June 20, 2008, Nakano sent my attorney a
letter setting forth the problems with his testimony
at my trial and stating that he would be willing to
sign a declaration and testify at a hearing if
 necessary. On August 14, 2008, Nakano sent a
declaration to my attorney. (See attached declaration
of counsel). Subsequently, Nakano sent my attorney an
amended declaration, signed and dated March 16, 2009
(See attached amended declaration of Nicolas Nakano).
 
I did not have all of the information from Nakano, at
the time of my first post-conviction petition. Nor
 did I know the extent of the prosecutor's conduct as I
never received any information about the improper ex
parte meeting until I heard from Nakano in June 2008.
 
I tried to raise the Nakano declaration on my appeal
of my first petition when I learned of it (See
attached Motion), however, the court would not
consider it as it was not presented to the circuit
court.
 
The Second Petition was denied without a hearing. On
 
appeal, Birano reasserts the above-referenced five grounds as
 
points of error on appeal. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Birano's points of error as follows:
 
The Second Petition repeats many of the same
 
contentions made in Birano's Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner From Custody, filed on 
April 3, 2007 (First Petition). Birano previously claimed that 
his right to be present at every stage of the proceeding was 
violated, the right of his counsel to be present at every stage 
of the proceeding was violated, his right to confront witnesses 
was violated, and his right to due process was violated. To the 
extent that Birano relies upon the same facts as he did before; 
that there was an ex-parte communication between Nicolas Nakano 
(Nakano), Nakano's attorney, the prosecutor, and the trial judge 
without Birano or Birano's counsel present, and that Nakano 
invoked his Fifth Amendment right, those claims have been 
previously ruled upon and relief is not available. See Hawai� i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40(a)(3). Nakano's 
statements in his Amended Declaration do not affect Birano's 
right to be present at all stages of the proceeding, Birano's 
right to have his counsel present at all stages of the 
proceeding, and/or his right to confront witnesses. Grounds One, 
Two and Four in the Second Petition are without merit. 
Ground Five in the Second Petition is waived. See HRAP
 
Rule 40(a)(3). Birano did not previously claim that the
 
prosecutor committed misconduct by having an ex-parte
 
communication with Nakano, Nakano's attorney, and the trial
 
judge. However, Birano clearly knew that the prosecutor had
 
participated in the ex-parte communication at the time of his
 
direct appeal and failed to raise a claim of prosecutorial
 
misconduct. Birano also failed to claim prosecutorial misconduct
 
in his First Petition. Birano is unable to prove the existence
 
of extraordinary circumstances to justify his failure to raise
 
this claim in his direct appeal or the First Petition.
 
The circuit court erred by failing to conduct a hearing
 
on Ground Three. The statements in Nakano's Amended Declaration
 
appear to constitute newly discovered evidence in accordance with
 
HRAP Rule 40(a)(1)(iv) because Birano claims that Nakano
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
contacted him in 2008 and provided him with the Amended
 
Declaration after he filed the First Petition. 
The additional evidence that Birano points to is that
 
"Nakano has indicated that the prosecutor put pressure on him to
 
testify and that his testimony was not truthful[.]" Birano
 
stated a colorable claim for relief on the grounds that his due
 
process rights were violated because Nakano's testimony was
 
untruthful and the result of coercion by the prosecutor.
 
Therefore, the Circuit Court's April 21, 2010 Order
 
Denying Petition to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to
 
Release Petitioner from Custody is affirmed in part and vacated
 
in part. This case is remanded for further proceedings
 
consistent with this Summary Disposition Order.
