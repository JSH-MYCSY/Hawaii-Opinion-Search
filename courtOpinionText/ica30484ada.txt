OPINION OF THE COURT BY LEONARD, J.
 
Petitioner-Appellant Aloha Tower Development 
Corporation (ATDC) appeals from a March 29, 2010 Final Judgment 
entered against ATDC by the Land Court.1 In the Final Judgment, 
the Land Court, inter alia, awarded attorneys' fees and costs, in 
the amount of $135,637.69, against ATDC and in favor of 
Intervenor-Defendant-Appellee Scenic Hawai� i, Inc. (Scenic 
2
Hawai�i), based on the private attorney general doctrine.  As 
discussed below, we conclude that the Land Court erred in its 
application of the private attorney general doctrine to this 
case. 
I. BACKGROUND
 
A. The Deed Restriction and Purported Waiver
 
On September 3, 1930, the Territory of Hawai� i 
(Territory) entered into an agreement with Helene Irwin Fagan 
(Fagan) and Honolulu Construction and Draying, Ltd. (HC&D), 
whereby: (1) HC&D agreed to sell the property at issue 
(Property) -- which is today known as Irwin Memorial Park (Irwin 
3
Park)  -- to Fagan for 2300 shares of common stock in Standard
Oil Company of California; (2) Fagan agreed to donate the
 
Property to the Territory; and (3) the Territory agreed to accept
 
the donation, subject to restrictions and conditions, including
 
that the Property would be maintained as a "public park to
 
beautify the entrance to Honolulu Harbor." The deed restrictions
 
and conditions stated that if any portion of the Property was

Inc., The Outdoor Circle, Historic Hawai� i Foundation, Hawai� i's

 Irwin Park "is located mauka of the Aloha Tower Marketplace

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ever abandoned as a public park, the Property would revert back

to Fagan and "her heirs and assigns[.]" 
 
On March 13, 1931, through Executive Order No. 472, the

Territory set aside the Property as a public park and noted that

the Territory owned the Property subject to the restrictions and

conditions set forth in the deed from Fagan to the Territory. In

1939, the Territory and Fagan entered into a Supplemental

Agreement "to permit the parking of vehicles of whatsoever

nature, whether with or without the payment of a fee or fees

. . . on that portion of [Irwin] [P]ark now set aside for the

parking of vehicles[.]" 
 
In 1951, the Territory sent a letter to Fagan seeking a

release of Fagan's restrictions on Irwin Park because plans to

widen Nimitz Highway would encroach upon a portion of the

Property. Fagan sent a reply in 1952, stating that she "agreed

that the restrictive conditions contained in [the Irwin Park]

deed will be withdrawn and cancelled." 
 
In 1966, Fagan passed away.

In 1981, the Legislature enacted Hawai' i Revised 
Statutes (HRS) Chapter 206J (2001 & Supp. 2011), which created 
ATDC as an agency of the State, and which provides that "Irwin 
Memorial Park shall be retained as a public park subject to the 
reservations and conditions set forth in the deed of [] Fagan to 
the Territory[.]" HRS § 206J-6. In 1999, Irwin Park was placed 
on the Hawai' i Register of Historic Places. 
B. The Land Court Proceedings

On May 15, 2001, ATDC, as the ground lessee of Irwin

Park, filed a Petition to modify and amend Land Court Transfer

Certificate of Title No. 310,513, pursuant to HRS § 501-196

(2006), in order to expunge the deed restrictions on Irwin Park

(Petition). Although not stated in the Petition, it appears that
 
ATDC was pursuing this relief to facilitate the construction of a

multi-story parking structure in Irwin Park.  Respondents to the
 
3

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Petition included William L. Olds, Jr. (Olds), and Jane Olds

Bogart (Bogart), the grandchildren and natural heirs of Fagan

(collectively, Fagan Heirs), and the Trustees of the William G.

4
Irwin Family Charity Foundation (Foundation),  which was named as
 
the residual beneficiary under Fagan's Will.

On June 8, 2001, before the Fagan Heirs' and the 
Foundation's responses to the Petition were filed, Scenic Hawai' i 
moved to intervene, seeking to represent the general public's 
interests, asserting that (1) the State, represented by the 
Department of the Attorney General, would not adequately 
represent the public's interest because ATDC, although 
represented by private counsel, and other State agencies, 
supported the development of Irwin Park, and (2) the Fagan Heirs 
had not (yet) been served and appeared to defend the restrictive 
covenant. Scenic Hawai' i contended that its interests involved 
"questions of law and fact that are inherently essential elements of the petition", including: 
Was and is there a legal waiver by Mrs. Fagan of the
restrictive covenant"? As to the evidence of a 'waiver'

suggested by [ATDC], is it authentic? Is the signature that
of Mrs. Fagan? Was the signature witnessed or notarized?
Was the purported 'waiver' conditioned upon a land exchange
involving Maui land? If so, was the land exchange ever
consummated? What were the intentions of Mrs. Fagan with
respect to the use, preservation and future reversion of
Irwin Memorial Park? Do the living heirs of Mrs. Fagan have
any information concerning Mrs. Fagan's intentions? If so,
what testimony or evidence might they present?

(Footnotes omitted.)

As noted above, the Fagan Heirs and the Foundation did

in fact (separately) respond to the Petition, vigorously opposing

the requested relief based on HRS § 206J-6(c), Executive Order

No. 472, which was recorded both as a Land Court Document and in

the Bureau of Conveyances, the unwaived and unreleased

reservations and conditions in the Fagan deed, and other grounds.

In 2001, the Trustee of the Foundation were Olds, Bogart, William
L. Olds, III, George T. Cronin, and Anthony O. Zanze.

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In addition, the City and County of Honolulu (City) moved to

intervene, asserting, inter alia, that "the City has obligation,

arguably a responsibility, to take actions which substantially

advance legitimate public interests including protecting and

preserving open space and the health and welfare to the public

that open spaces in urban areas afford", that "removal of the

restrictive covenants would eliminate the City's interest in

preserving the park", and that "disposition of this matter

without the City's involvement would greatly impede its ability

to protect the public's interest in preserving open space in a

high urban area like downtown Honolulu." (Format altered.) The

City's motion to intervene was granted. As the owner of the

Property and the lessor on the ground lease with ATDC, the State

was joined as a necessary and indispensable party. The

Department of Land and Natural Resources, which administers the

State's public lands, was also joined.

After a non-jury trial, on December 12, 2002, the Land

Court announced its ruling on ATDC's Petition, finding that Fagan

neither waived the restrictive covenants burdening the Property

nor gifted her reversionary interest in the Property. On that

basis, the Petition was denied.

On August 28, 2008, Scenic Hawai' i filed a motion 
seeking attorneys' fees and costs based on the private attorney 
general doctrine. 
On November 3, 2008, the Land Court entered its

Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, setting forth its

ruling on the Petition.

After various additional submissions of the parties, 
and hearings on the matter, on June 26, 2009, the Land Court 
entered an order granting in part and denying in part Scenic 
Hawai'i's motion for fees and costs. Although the Land Court 
concluded that Scenic Hawai' i had satisfied the three-prong test 
requisite to the application of the private attorney general 
5

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
doctrine, it denied without prejudice any award of attorneys' 
fees due to issues related to the form of the billing entries 
submitted to the court. After a renewed motion, and further 
submissions of the parties, on February 24, 2010, the Land Court 
granted Scenic Hawai' i's renewed request for attorneys' fees and 
ordered ATDC to pay Scenic Hawai' i a total of $135,637.69, 
inclusive of attorneys' fees and costs. 
Final judgment was entered on March 29, 2010, and a

notice of appeal was timely filed thereafter.

II. POINT OF ERROR

ATDC raises a single point of error, contending that 
the Land Court erred when it granted an award of attorneys' fees 
to Scenic Hawai' i under the private attorney general doctrine. 
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW

"The trial court's grant or denial of attorney's fees 
and costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp. of State of Hawai' i, 120 Hawai' i 
181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 1242 (2009) (Sierra Club II) (citations 
and brackets omitted). "The trial court abuses its discretion if 
it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a 
clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. In other words, an 
abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly 
exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles 
of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party 
litigant." Maui Tomorrow v. State of Hawai' i, Bd. of Land & 
Natural Res., 110 Hawai' i 234, 242, 131 P.3d 517, 525 (2006) 
(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted). 
IV. DISCUSSION

A. The Private Attorney General Doctrine

The sole issue on appeal is whether the Land Court

abused its discretion when it awarded attorneys' fees to Scenic

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i.5 The Hawai' i Supreme Court has often stated that 
"normally, pursuant to the 'American Rule,' each party is 
responsible for paying his or her own litigation expenses." 
Sierra Club II, 120 Hawai' i at 218, 202 P.3d at 1263 (citation 
and brackets omitted). The supreme court has recognized various exceptions to this general rule, most commonly when authorized by 
statute, rule, or the parties' agreement, but also, in more 
limited circumstances, through judicially-created exceptions such 
as the private attorney general doctrine. See id.; see also In 
re Water Use Permit Applications, 96 Hawai' i 27, 29-30, 25 P.3d 
802, 804-05 (2001) (Waiahole II) (noting various common law 
exceptions). 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court twice considered, but did not 
apply, the private attorney general doctrine in Waiahole II and 
Maui Tomorrow, before expressly adopting and applying it in 
Sierra Club II. In the first case, Waiahole II, the supreme 
court highlighted the arguments in favor of and against adoption 
of the private attorney general doctrine and explained how courts 
have limited the application of the doctrine to exceptional cases 
in order to provide effective constraints on judicial discretion. 
Waiahole II, 96 Hawai' i at 30-31, 25 P.3d at 805-06. The court 
recited the California Supreme Court's summary of the arguments in favor of the private attorney general doctrine, including: 
In the complex society in which we live it frequently occurs
that citizens in great numbers and across a broad spectrum

5

None of the parties challenged the Land Court's decision on the
merits of ATDC's petition, i.e., the determination that Fagan did not
relinquish, waive, or gift her reversionary interest in the Property, that therestrictions and conditions in the deed from Fagan to the Territory remainvalid and in effect, and, therefore, that ATDC was not entitled to anexpungement of the deed restrictions registered on Transfer Certificate ofTitle No. 310,513. Nor did any of the parties contend that the Land Courterred when it determined that Scenic Hawai' i had standing and would be
permitted to intervene in this Land Court registration matter. We also note that none of the State parties argued that sovereign immunity bars an award ofattorney's fees against a State agency herein (or attempted to distinguishthis case from the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity that was held toapply in Sierra Club II). Therefore, we do not address these issues and thisopinion should be construed accordingly.

have interests in common. These, while of enormous
significance to the society as a whole, do not involve the
fortunes of a single individual to the extent necessary to
encourage their private vindication in the courts. Although
there are within the executive branch of the government
offices and institutions (exemplified by the Attorney
General) whose function it is to represent the general
public in such matters and to ensure proper enforcement, for
various reasons the burden of enforcement is not always
adequately carried by those offices and institutions,
rendering some sort of private action imperative. . . . 
 
Id. at 30, 25 P.3d at 805 (citation omitted; emphasis added).

As stated by an Arizona court, "the purpose of the

doctrine is to promote vindication of important public rights." 
 
Id. (citation omitted).

Other courts, including the United States Supreme 
Court, have rejected the private attorney general doctrine, 
instead deferring to legislative bodies to specify statutory 
exceptions to the American Rule and raising concerns, including 
concerns about "[u]nbridled judicial authority to 'pick and 
choose' which plaintiffs and causes of action merit an award of 
attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine[.]" 
Id. at 30-31, 25 P.3d at 805-06 (citations omitted). Given the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court's ultimate embrace of the private attorney 
general doctrine, the court presumably was satisfied with the proponents' responses to these criticisms, most importantly that 
"limiting the application of the doctrine to exceptional cases 
pursuant to the three-prong test articulated [below] provides 
effective constraints on judicial discretion." Id. at 31, 25 
P.3d at 806 (citations omitted). The supreme court clearly embraced these constraints, as it utilized the three-prong test 
in Sierra Club II, as well as in Waiahole II and Maui Tomorrow. 
The test adopted by the Hawai' i Supreme Court requires 
consideration of three factors: "(1) the strength or societal 
importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) 
the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the 
resultant burden on the plaintiff, [and] (3) the number of people 
standing to benefit from the decision." Sierra Club II, 120 
8

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i at 218, 202 P.3d at 1263 (citations omitted; emphasis 
added). 
In Waiahole II, the supreme court held that the private 
attorney general doctrine did not apply because, although the 
first and third prongs of the doctrine's three-prong test were 
met, the second prong was not. Waiahole II, 96 Hawai' i at 31-32, 
25 P.3d at 806-07. Regarding the first and third prongs, the court concluded, "this case involved constitutional rights of 
profound significance, and all of the citizens of the state, 
present and future, stood to benefit from the decision." Id. at 
31, 25 P.3d at 806 (citation omitted). The court was not convinced, however, that the second prong was satisfied, 
explaining that, "[i]n other cases, the plaintiffs served as the 
sole representative of the vindicated public interest. The 
government either completely abandoned, or actively opposed, the 
plaintiff's cause." Id. (citations omitted). In the three 
cases referenced by the supreme court, either: (1) "the agency charged with representing consumer interests made no appearance 
at all and [] the government opposed the plaintiffs on all 
issues"; (2) "no governmental agency could reasonably have been 
expected to represent the rights asserted by plaintiffs"; or (3) 
"the state's position [was] that it was obligated to defend the 
disputed statutes[.] Id. (citations omitted). In Waiahole II, 
the parties seeking private-attorney-general fees, denominated the "Windward Parties," represented "one of many competing public 
and private interests[.]" Id. Significantly, the supreme court 
emphasized that "unlike other cases, in which the plaintiffs single-handedly challenged a previously established government 
law or policy, in this case, the Windward Parties challenged the 
decision of a tribunal in an adversarial proceeding not 
contesting any action or policy of the government." Id. at 32, 
25 P.3d at 807.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In Maui Tomorrow, although the supreme court recognized 
that, unlike the plaintiffs in Waiahole II, the plaintiffs 
therein were challenging a policy of the Board of Land and 
Natural Resources (BLNR), the supreme court rejected the 
applicability of the private attorney general doctrine based on 
its reasoning in Waiahole II. Maui Tomorrow, 110 Hawai' i at 244­
45, 131 P.3d 527-28. In Maui Tomorrow, the supreme court concluded that the requirements for the applicability of the 
private attorney general doctrine were not met because the State 
had not abandoned its duty to protect native Hawaiians' 
constitutionally-protected rights. Id. at 245, 131 P.3d at 528. 
Rather, the BLNR was under the mistaken impression that the duty was to be fulfilled by another State agency. Id. In addition, 
the court noted that, as in Waiahole II, the plaintiffs cited no cases in which fees were awarded under similar procedural 
circumstances. Id. 
In Sierra Club II, the Hawai' i Supreme Court concluded 
that all three requirements for the application of the private 
attorney general doctrine were satisfied. Sierra Club II, 120 
Hawai'i at 220, 202 P.3d at 1265. Regarding the first prong of 
the test, the supreme court rejected the State's argument that no 
public policy was vindicated by Sierra Club's litigation, 
concluding instead that "this litigation is responsible for 
establishing the principle of procedural standing in 
environmental law in Hawai' i and clarifying the importance of 
addressing the secondary impacts of a project in the environmental review process pursuant to HRS chapter 343." Id. 
Regarding the second prong, the supreme court stated that the plaintiffs therein "were solely responsible for challenging DOT's 
erroneous application of its responsibilities under HRS chapter 
343." Id. (emphasis added). The court further noted that the 
State "exempted the Superferry project from the requirements of HRS chapter 343 without considering its secondary impacts on the 
10

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
environment[,]" thereby wholly abandoning "its duty to consider

both the primary and secondary impacts of the Superferry project

on the environment." Id. at 221, 202 P.3d at 1266. Finally, the
 
supreme court agreed with the Sierra Club's argument that the

third prong was satisfied because the court's decision in Sierra

6
Club I provided a public benefit in that it established
 
procedural standing in environmental law cases and clarified the

need to address secondary impacts in an HRS chapter 343

environmental review, and noted that its holding in Sierra Club

7	
II determined that Act 2  was unconstitutional.8
 Id.

B. Application of the Private Attorney General Doctrine

In this case, ATDC argues that none of the requirements 
for the application of the private attorney general doctrine are met. Scenic Hawai' i argues that all three prongs of the test 
have been met. 
1.		First prong: the strength or societal importance
of the public policy vindicated by the litigation

ATDC argues, inter alia, that the Land Court's 
rejection of its petition to expunge certain deed restrictions is 
not a broad-based public policy vindication of the type necessary 
to invoke the private attorney general doctrine. Scenic Hawai' i 
argues that "[b]y holding ATDC and the State to its statutory duty to preserve this park for the public good," Scenic Hawai' i 
vindicated an important public policy. We are not convinced that 
6

Sierra Club I refers to Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp. of State
of Hawai' i, 115 Hawai' i 299, 167 P.3d 292 (2007).

Act 2 refers to "A Bill for An Act Relating to Transportation"
signed by Governor Linda Lingle on November 2, 2007. 2007 Haw. Sess. Laws Act

2, §§ 1-18 at 5-21.

8

In Sierra Club II, the supreme court further held that the private
attorney general doctrine is subject to potential defenses and, therefore,continued its analysis. Sierra Club II, 120 Hawai' i at 221, 202 P.3d at 1266.
As ATDC has raised no such defenses, we need not consider this aspect of thecourt's analysis in the present case. 
11

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ATDC's "statutory duty" was at issue in the Land Court

proceedings.

The legal and factual issues before the Land Court 
concerned whether ATDC had demonstrated it was entitled to modify 
and amend Land Court Transfer Certificate of Title No. 310,513, 
pursuant to HRS § 501-196, to expunge the deed restrictions on 
the Property transferred from Fagan to the Territory. The public 
policy advocated by Scenic Hawai' i, however laudable, had no 
connection to or impact on the factual dispute regarding whether Fagan had waived the deed restrictions or gifted the reversionary 
interest. Put another way, even if the Land Court had adopted 
Scenic Hawai' i's argument that the State abandoned its public 
trust duty to protect the public's interest in maintaining the Property in its current configuration as a park, that position 
would not have been dispositive of the factual issue of whether 
Fagan waived the deed restrictions or gifted her reversionary 
interest to the Territory.
9 Moreover, whether the Petition was 
granted or denied, the Land Court's ruling on the Petition was only tangential to the ultimate disposition and future use of 
Irwin Park and did not include any determination as to whether 
ATDC's intended use was a violation of HRS § 206J-6 or in 
contravention of Hawai' i Historic Preservation Law, HRS chapter 
6E. Cf. Sierra Club II, 120 Hawai' i at 220, 202 P.3d at 1265 
(holding that the litigation initiated by Sierra Club was 
"responsible for establishing the principle of procedural 
standing in environmental law in Hawai' i and clarifying the 
9

The minutes of the March 27, 2009 hearing on Scenic Hawai' i's fees 
motion state that "the first prong is met because the public policy at stake
is the public's right to maintain Irwin Park as a public memorial park in itscurrent form instead of erecting a multiple level parking structure upon it."However, notwithstanding that the Land Court's ruling may have led to anabandonment of ATDC's project and the maintenance of Irwin Park in its currentform, the determination of whether or not Fagan waived the deed restrictionsor gifted the reversionary interest is not concomitantly transformed intovindication of public policy of strong societal importance. 
12

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
importance of addressing the secondary impacts of a project in

the environmental review process pursuant to HRS chapter 343").

2.		Second prong: the necessity for private
enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant
burden on the plaintiff

As the State points out, the respondents to the 
Petition, including the persons who hold the private reversionary 
interests in the Property, appeared and defended their interests. 
As noted above, the City also intervened in the case for the 
purpose of defending essentially the same public interests that 
Scenic Hawai' i sought to protect. Scenic Hawai' i argues that its 
intervention was necessary because the State, including the Attorney General, supported ATDC's Petition and the private 
parties, Olds and Bogart, were California residents with minimal 
connections with Hawai' i. 
These circumstances are in stark contrast to those 
contemplated to necessitate the services of private attorneys 
general. As the supreme court noted in Waiahole II, the private 
attorney general exception to the American Rule is warranted only 
when the litigated issues are "of enormous significance to the 
society as a whole, [but] do not involve the fortunes of a single 
individual to the extent necessary to encourage their private 
vindication in the courts." Waiahole II, 96 Hawai' i at 30, 25 
P.3d at 805 (citation omitted). Here, there were actual respondents who vigorously litigated their private interests. We 
reject any argument that California residents are inherently less 
interested in preserving their property rights in Hawai' i, 
particularly in this case, where they have appeared and defended those rights. In addition, even if we assume that the public's 
interests were at issue in this case and the State did not 
properly represent the general public's interest in maintaining 
Irwin Park in its current form, it appears that the City's 
intervention eliminated any need for "private enforcement." Like 
13

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the plaintiffs in Waiahole II, and unlike the plaintiffs in 
Sierra Club II, Scenic Hawai' i did not serve "as the sole 
representative of the vindicated public interest." Waiahole II, 
96 Hawai' i at 31, 25 P.3d at 806; see also Sierra Club II, 120 
Hawai'i at 220, 202 P.3d at 1265. 
As we conclude that it was unnecessary for Scenic 
Hawai'i to respond to ATDC Land Court petition, as necessity is 
construed under the private attorney general doctrine, we need 
not consider the magnitude of the burden resulting from Scenic 
Hawai'i's intervention in this case. 
3.		Third prong: the number of people standing to
benefit from the decision

Because Scenic Hawai' i did not satisfy either the first 
or second prong, there is no need to address the number of people 
standing to benefit from the decision. In Waiahole II, the 
supreme court held that the private attorney general doctrine did 
not apply because although the plaintiffs met the first and third 
prongs of the doctrine's three-part test, they failed to satisfy 
the second prong. Waiahole II, 96 Hawai' i at 31, 25 P.3d at 806. 
4.		The Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs

As discussed above, a trial court's award of attorneys' 
fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, but a trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view 
of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the facts of 
the case. See Maui Tomorrow, 110 Hawai' i at 242, 131 P.3d at 
525. This assessment is particularly critical in the application 
of the private attorney general doctrine's three-prong test, 
which acts as a constraint on what might otherwise be unbridled 
judicial discretion to depart from the well-established American 
Rule. See Waiahole II, 96 Hawai' i at 30-31, 25 P.3d at 805-06. 
In this case, as the three-prong test is not met, we must conclude that the Land Court abused its discretion in awarding 
attorneys' fees and costs to Scenic Hawai' i. 
14

FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
V. CONCLUSION

For these reasons, the Land Court's March 29, 2010

Final Judgment is reversed in part, to the extent that it granted

attorneys' fees and costs to Scenic Hawai' i, and is affirmed in 
all other respects.
