apartment co-owners at the Pacific Monarch condominium project in
 
Honolulu, Hawai 'i against Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff­
Appellant/Cross-Appellee Association of Apartment Owners of
 Pacific Monarch, Inc. ("AOAO"), contending that the AOAO violated
 the November 14, 1995 Restated Declaration of the Association of
 Apartment Owners of Pacific Monarch ("Restated Declaration") and
 the November 14, 1995 Restated Bylaws of the Association of
 Apartment Owners of Pacific Monarch ("Restated Bylaws") by
 refusing to sell them the leased fee interest in their apartment. 
Specifically, Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants-Appellees/Cross-
Appellants Clarence O. Furuya and Lona Lum Furuya (collectively,
 the "Furuyas") contend that the AOAO was unwilling to include the
 leased fee interest in certain limited common elements
 appurtenant to the apartment in the sale.
 
In its appeal, the AOAO challenges the March 2, 2010
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order ("March 2010

 The AOAO contends that in the March 2010 FOF/COL, the Circuit
Court erred (1) by speculating that the developer intended to give up its
right to lease rent for 106 parking stalls appurtenant to Unit 3206 ("Parking
Stalls") after 2014; (2) in finding that the Furuyas' obligation to pay
maintenance fees and lease rent after 2014 is "purely a function of the
percentage of common interest (0.5107%) assigned to [Unit 3206]"; (3) in
concluding that Subsection 1A of a condominium conveyance document recorded on
June 1, 1979 ("Conveyance Document") was not subject to the rent renegotiation
provision in Subsection 1(e) of the Conveyance Document; (4) in finding and
concluding that the rent renegotiation provision in Subsection 1(e) of the
Conveyance Document did not apply to the Parking Stalls because the Parking
Stalls were not assigned any percentage of common interest in the common
elements; (5) in concluding that the AOAO had ratified the terms of the

I. Background
 
This appeal concerns Unit 3206, an apartment unit at
 
the Pacific Monarch, a condominium project located on K uhio
 
Avenue in Honolulu, which was established on February 5, 1979
 
pursuant to the Pacific Monarch Declaration of Horizontal
 Property Regime Under Chapter 514A, Hawaii Revised Statutes
 ("Declaration"). Appurtenant to Unit 3206 are 106 parking stalls
 ("Parking Stalls"), which, the Declaration states, "are for the
 exclusive use of the owner of Unit 3206." 
In 1979, Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls were conveyed
 
by Hasegawa Komuten (USA), Inc., the developer of the Pacific
 Monarch, to Rex Duane Johnson and Paula Kathleen Johnson
 (together, the "Johnsons") via the Pacific Monarch Condominium
 Conveyance Document recorded on June 1, 1979 ("Conveyance
 Document"). The Parking Stalls "comprise[d] all of the numbered
 limited common element parking stalls" in the Pacific Monarch. 
Following the foreclosure of the Johnsons' interest, "Apartment
 3206 and the Parking Stalls were conveyed to [the Furuyas] by a
 Commissioner's Assignment of Condominium Conveyance Document
 recorded . . . on July 28, 1985."
5
 
On September 22, 1995, an amendment to the Declaration
 
was recorded, authorizing the AOAO's Board of Directors ("Board")
 to purchase the fee interest in the Pacific Monarch's land and to
 re-sell that interest to the AOAO members or other parties:
 
Subsection (s) shall be added and shall read in its
entirety as follows: 
Implementation of the Acquisition of the Leased Fee
Interest in the Land from Lessor.
 
The Board of Directors shall be authorized and have
 
the power to do all things it deems necessary to enable the
Lessor and/or its successors or assigns of the leased fee

AOAO; (19) in concluding that Count IV of the Complaint, relating to
injunctive relief, was moot; and (20) in granting the AOAO, and denying the
Furuyas, attorneys' fees and costs. In their supplemental opening brief, the
Furuyas also state a generalized grievance that the Circuit Court erred in
"concluding that there was substantial evidence to support the conclusions."
This point of error does not merit consideration outside of the points of
error actually argued.

interest in the land (Lessor) to sell that interest to the
Association and/or its members. The Board on behalf of the
 Association shall be authorized to purchase all or any
portion of the Leased Fee interest from the Lessor and is
expressly authorized to transact any and all other matters
relating to the acquisition specifically but not limited to
the following:
 
. . . .
 
5. To sell the leased fee interest in the land
 
involving the appurtenant apartment or commercial units,
first to the Lessee of the appurtenant apartment or
commercial unit and if the leased fee interest in the land
 is unsold, then to any interested Lessee in the Association
or other interested third party by any equitable method of
sale as determined in the sole discretion of the Board.
 
The deed conveying the leased fee interest in the land to the
 
AOAO was recorded on November 26, 1996, with the stated purpose
 of making the leased fee interest available to the individual
 apartment owners. 
A. The Complaint and Counterclaim
 
1. The Complaint
 
On November 30, 2007, the Furuyas filed their First
 
Amended Complaint ("Complaint").6 The Complaint alleged that the
 
AOAO offered to sell the leased fee interest appurtenant to Unit
 3206 to the Furuyas and Clarence Furuya allegedly accepted the
 offer by executing the Pacific Monarch Leased Fee Interest Sales
 Contract Deposit Receipt Offer and Acceptance ("DROA"). The
 Furuyas thereafter deposited earnest money, identified as
 
6/
 The Furuyas asserted thirteen counts against the AOAO, including:
Count I—breach of contract (relating to the AOAO's refusal to sell the leased
fee interest in Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls to the Furuyas pursuant to
the DROA); Count II—specific performance; Count IV—injunctive relief (seeking
an injunction barring the AOAO from selling the Furuyas' interest to a third
party); Count V—declaratory judgment (seeking, among other things, a
declaration that the Furuyas "have no obligation to pay lease rent on the
parking stalls after 2014"); Count VI—promissory estoppel (claiming that the
Furuyas detrimentally relied on the AOAO's promises to convey the leased fee
interest to the Furuyas); Count VII—equitable estoppel (claiming that the
Furuyas detrimentally relied upon the AOAO's assurances that the Furuyas would
be entitled to purchase the leased fee interests and the AOAO's conduct in
assisting other apartment owners in purchasing their respective fee
interests); Count IX—ultra vires actions (claiming that the AOAO does not have
the right under the declaration and bylaws "to hold and maintain parking
stalls in its own name in derogation of the rights of the individual unit
owners"); Count X—unjust enrichment (claiming that the AOAO would be unjustly
enriched if it were allowed to retain the leased fee interest to Unit 3206 and
 the Parking Stalls while also keeping higher maintenance fees or the revenue
loss from the use and conversion of several of the Parking Stalls); and Count
XI—conversion (claiming that the AOAO converted some of the Parking Stalls).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
relating to the purchase, into an escrow account. 
The Furuyas alleged that the AOAO expressed an interest
 
in purchasing the Furuyas' leasehold interest in the Parking
 
Stalls, while the Furuyas still wished to complete purchase of
 the leased fee interest to Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls. 
Negotiations over the Parking Stalls continued for several years,
 with each party allegedly desiring to obtain the other's
 respective interest. On or about December 1, 2003, the Furuyas
 claim to have "made a formal request to go forward with the
 purchase of Plaintiffs['] Fee Interest, which request was refused
 by Defendant AOAO, as were subsequent requests by Plaintiffs to
 go forward with the sale of Plaintiffs['] Fee Interest to
 Plaintiffs." 
The Complaint further alleged that since the time that
 
the Furuyas acquired Unit 3206 in 1985, the AOAO had converted
 several of the Parking Stalls, including two stalls
7
 for
permanent use as a laundry facility, a reserved parking stall,
 and five stalls for handicapped parking. 
On the basis of these allegations, the Furuyas asserted
 
that the AOAO committed breach of contract by refusing to sell
 the leased fee interest in Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls to
 the Furuyas pursuant to the DROA, and sought various forms of
 relief, including specific performance and injunctive relief. 
Additionally, the Furuyas sought a declaratory judgment that
 declared, 
inter alia, that the Furuyas "have no obligation to pay
 
lease rent on the parking stalls after 2014". The Complaint also
 contained promissory estoppel, equitable estoppel, ultra vires
 actions, unjust enrichment, and conversion claims. 
2. The Counterclaim
 
In its first amended counterclaim ("Counterclaim"),
 
filed on March 11, 2008, the AOAO alleged breach of contract,
 contending that the Furuyas "refused to timely close the purchase
 of the Apartment or the Parking Stalls." The Counterclaim
 
7/
 While the Complaint references three such stalls, the Circuit
Court's findings clarify that there were just two such stalls.

continued:8
 
8. On or about April 23, 1996, [the Furuyas] signed a
form indicating that if the Association purchased the leased
fee interest from the lessor, [the Furuyas] would purchase
the leased fee interests appurtenant to their property at
[the Pacific Monarch] at the prices assigned to those
interests: $28,756.85 for each of the two apartments and
$459,131.19 for the leased fee interest in the Parking
Stalls.
 
9. In reliance on the commitment by [the Furuyas],
the Association entered into a contract to purchase the
leased fee interest in the [Pacific Monarch] in bulk from
the lessor.
 
10. On or about October 21, 1996, [the Furuyas]
executed [the DROA] for the purchase of the leased fee
interest covering Apartment 3206 and the appurtenant 106
Parking Stalls from the Association.
 
11. By Limited Warranty Deed dated November 26, 1996,
recorded in said Bureau, the Association acquired the leased
fee interest in the [Pacific Monarch] including the leased
fee interest appurtenant to Apartment 3206 and the Parking
Stalls.
 
The AOAO argued, within the equitable estoppel/reformation count
 
in its Counterclaim, that the Furuyas would be unjustly enriched
 if they failed to pay lease rent for use of the AOAO's property,
 that the Furuyas should be estopped from asserting that they do
 not have to pay lease rent after 2014 for the Parking Stalls, and
 that the Circuit Court "should reform the Lease to provide that
 [the Furuyas'] lease rent continues after the year 2014 for . . .
 the Parking Stalls."
 
B. Partial dismissal of the Furuyas' claims
 
The case was tried without a jury. On June 24, 2009,
 
after the Furuyas rested, the AOAO moved for a directed verdict
 
8/
 The AOAO ultimately asserted eight claims in its Counterclaim,
including: Count IV—breach of contract and promissory estoppel (claiming that
the Furuyas failed to timely close on the purchase of the leased fee
interests); Count V—attorneys' fees (seeking fees and costs for "enforcing any
provision of the Project Documents and/or chapter 514A"); Count
VI—anticipatory breach of contract (seeking a ruling that the Furuyas may not
breach their conveyance document and that the Furuyas are required to pay
lease rent to the AOAO for the use of the leased fee interest appurtenant to
the Parking Stalls after 2014); Count VII—equitable estoppel/reformation
(claiming that the Furuyas would be unjustly enriched if they failed to pay
lease rent for use of the AOAO's property, that the Furuyas should be estopped
from asserting that they do not have to pay lease rent after 2014, and that
the Circuit Court "should reform the Lease to provide that [the Furuyas']
lease rent continues after the year 2014 for . . . the Parking Stalls"); and
Count VIII—mistake/reformation (seeking reformation of the lease to provide
that lease rent for the Parking Stalls continues after the year 2014).
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
pursuant to, among other things, Hawai 'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
("HRCP") Rule 41(b). After a recess, the Circuit Court announced
that it would treat the motion as a motion to dismiss under HRCP
 Rule 41(b), and would therefore consider the evidence in the
 light most favorable to the nonmoving party. 
 
The Circuit Court held that the DROA was not
 
enforceable:
 
And here, you know, as it relates to Mr. Furuya . . . the
Court had an opportunity to listen to his testimony at
length, which is a significant part, I guess the bulk of the
case. . . . [A]nd in looking at the documents, and
particularly the DROA and some of the other governing
documents, it's the Court's view that as a matter of law,
that the contract that plaintiff attempts to rely on, the
DROA for enforcement and damages, basically is not
enforceable. . . . So I'm going to respectfully grant the
motion as it relates to Counts 1 and 2.
 
The Circuit Court also made brief oral rulings on the remaining
 
counts, dismissing Counts IV, VI, VII, IX, and XI and partially
 dismissing Counts V and X. 
On July 21, 2009, the Circuit Court filed the Order
 
Granting Partial Dismissal of Plaintiffs Clarence O. Furuya and
 Lona Lum Furuya's First Amended Complaint Filed on November 30,
 2007 Pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b) in Favor of Defendant
 Association of Apartment Owners of Pacific Monarch, Inc.
 ("Partial Dismissal Order"). The order dismissed the counts as
 stated in the Circuit Court's oral ruling pursuant to HRCP Rule
 41(b), but left unresolved whether the Furuyas had an obligation
 to pay lease rent for the Parking Stalls after the year 2014
 under Count V, and whether the Furuyas were entitled to damages
 for the alleged unauthorized use of the two parking stalls
 assigned to the laundry facilities under Count X. 
C. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Judgment
 
On March 2, 2010, after a full trial, the Circuit Court
 
filed the March 2010 FOF/COL which noted that many of the claims
 
asserted by both sides had been dismissed and that, because of
 its ruling on the AOAO's oral HRCP Rule 41(b) motion, Count IV of
 the Counterclaim had been rendered moot. The Circuit Court
 explicitly stated that its "decision relates only to the[]
 remaining claims/counterclaims" - Count V (Declaratory Judgment ­
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
AOAO) and Count X (Unjust Enrichment - AOAO) of the Complaint;
 
and Count V (Attorneys Fees/Costs), Count VI (Anticipatory Breach
 of Contract), Count VII (Equitable Estoppel/Reformation) and
 Count VIII (Mistake/Reformation) of the Counterclaim. The
 Circuit Court granted declaratory relief to the Furuyas, stating
 that "under the [Conveyance Document], no 'additional rent' for
 the parking stalls is due after April 26, 2014", and concluded
 that the Furuyas were not liable to the AOAO for Counts V, VI,
 VII, and VIII of the Counterclaim, dismissing those claims. The
 Judgment followed, and was entered on April 6, 2010. 
D.	 Attorneys' fees and costs
 
On March 22, 2010, the AOAO and its directors who had
 
previously been dismissed from the case moved for attorneys' fees
 
and costs pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") §§ 514A­94(a) and (b) and 607-14, the Restated Declaration, and the
 Restated Bylaws. On April 15, 2010, the Furuyas also moved for
 an award of attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to HRS §§ 514A-94,
 514B-157, 607-9, and 607-14. 
On June 15, 2010, the Circuit Court denied the Furuyas'
 
motion and granted the AOAO's motion, awarding the AOAO and its
 Directors, as the prevailing parties, reasonable attorneys' fees
 in the amount of $241,361.00, general excise taxes of $11,281.64,
 and reasonable costs in the amount of $19,349.55. On July 13,
 2010, the Circuit Court entered the Judgment Re Award of
 Attorney's Fees and Costs. 
E.	 Findings of fact and conclusions of law on temporary
remand
 
On October 25, 2012, this court determined that the
 
Partial Dismissal Order was not properly supported with findings
 
of fact and conclusions of law and temporarily remanded the case
 to the Circuit Court for the issuance of such findings and
 conclusions, noting that "[a]lthough the Circuit Court . . .
 dismissed claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 41(b), the ruling should
 be considered made pursuant to HRCP 52(c)." In response, on
 December 21, 2012, the Circuit Court filed the Findings of Fact
 and Conclusions of Law in Support of the Order Granting Partial

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dismissal of Plaintiffs Clarence O. Furuya and Lona Lum Furuya's

 Owners of Pacific Monarch, Inc., Filed on July 21, 2009

II. Standards of Review
 
Order Granting Partial Dismissal - HRCP Rule 41(b)/52(c)
 
"Where we have patterned a rule of procedure after an
 
equivalent rule within the FRCP [Federal Rules of Civil
 
Procedure], interpretations of the rule by the federal courts are
deemed to be highly persuasive in the reasoning of this court." 
Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agric. Prods., 86 Hawai
'i 214, 
251-52, 948 P.2d 1055, 1092-93 (1997) (quoting Harada v. Burns,
 50 Haw. 528, 532, 445 P.2d 376, 380 (1968)) (internal quotation
 marks omitted).
  
In reviewing the district court's judgment entered
under Rule 52(c), we review its findings of fact for clear
error and its conclusions of law de novo. Lee v. W. Coast
 Life Ins. Co., 688 F.3d 1004, 1009 (9th Cir.2012). If the
district court applied the correct legal rule, we may set
aside its findings of fact as clearly erroneous only if they
are "illogical, implausible, or without support in
inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the record."
United States v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1263 (9th Cir.2009)
(en banc). In applying this standard in the context of a
bench trial, we "must constantly have in mind that [our]
function is not to decide factual issues de novo." Anderson
 
v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504,
84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).
"If the district court's account of the evidence is
 plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,
[we] may not reverse it even though convinced that had [we]
been sitting as the trier of fact, [we] would have weighed
the evidence differently." Id. at 573–74, 105 S.Ct. 1504.
 
United Steel Workers Local 12-369 v. United Steel Workers Int'l,
 
728 F.3d 1107, 1114 (9th Cir. 2013).
 
Findings of fact
 
Findings "are reviewed under the clearly erroneous 
standard." Aickin v. Ocean View Invs. Co., 84 Hawai 'i 447, 453,

"However, a conclusion of law that presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard because the court's conclusions are dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case." Id. (quoting Sierra 
Club, 120 Hawai

III. Discussion
 
A.	 The AOAO's appeal
 
1.	 Regarding lease rent for the Parking Stalls after
2014, the Circuit Court's interpretation of the
Conveyance Document was not erroneous (Points of
Error 1–4)
 
The lease rent for the Parking Stalls after 2014 was
 
one of the issues resolved after a full bench trial. The AOAO
 
contends that the Circuit Court erred when it interpreted the
 Conveyance Document regarding the lease rent for the Parking
 Stalls in the March 2010 FOF/COL. Specifically, the AOAO
 challenges the Circuit Court's "speculating" that the developer
 intended to give up its right to lease rent for the Parking
 Stalls after 2014; the court's findings that the Furuyas'
 obligation to pay maintenance fees and lease rent after 2014 is
 "purely a function of the percentage of common interest (0.5107%)
 assigned to [Unit 3206]"; the court's finding and concluding that
 Section IV.1A ("Subsection 1A") of the Conveyance Document was
 not subject to the rent renegotiation provision in Section IV.1.e
 ("Subsection 1(e)") of the Conveyance Document; and the court's
 finding and concluding that the rent renegotiation provision in
 Subsection 1(e) of the Conveyance Document did not apply to the
 Parking Stalls because the Parking Stalls were not assigned any
 percentage of common interest in the common elements.
 
The Conveyance Document conveys Unit 3206 and, among
 
other things, "[e]xclusive easements to use parking stalls 1
 through 106" and "[a]n undivided interest, equal to the
 percentage shown above, as tenant in common with Developer, its
 successors and assigns, in and to the Common Elements of the
 [Pacific Monarch] (exclusive of the Land)[.]" The Conveyance
 Document provides that Unit 3206 has a 0.5107% undivided interest
 and that its percentage of residential expenses is 0.5233%. The
 
Conveyance Document, effective April 27, 1979, also provides that
 
the Apartment Owner leases from Developer "an undivided interest,
 equal to Apartment Owner's common interest in the Common Elements
 appurtenant to the Apartment as set forth in the Declaration
 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
. . . as tenants in common with other lessees in and to the Land
 
situate at Waikiki, City and County of Honolulu," with such
 rights to the undivided interest in the Land until April 27,
 2054. 
Section IV, including Subsection 1(e), of the
 
Conveyance Document states, in pertinent part:
 
IV. Apartment Owner's Covenants. The Apartment Owner, in
consideration of the premises, hereby covenants and agrees with
Developer as follows:
 
1. Rental. The Apartment Owner covenants and
agrees to pay or cause to be paid rental in lawful money of
the United States of America to Developer, or as Developer
may hereafter designate in writing, without notice or demand
as follows:
 
(a) $444.00 per annum for the period
commencing on the Effective Date hereof and ending on
Apr 26, 1989;
 
(b) $600.00 per annum for the next ten
(10) years of said term ending on Apr 26, 1999;
 
(c) $804.00 per annum for the next ten
(10) years of said term ending Apr 26, 2009;
 
(d) $948.00 per annum for the next five
(5) years of said term ending [illegible], 2014;
 
Such annual rental shall be payable monthly each
month during the term hereof in advance on the first
day of the month. Rental for any partial month at the
commencement or termination of any rental period shall
be prorated.
(e) For each of the remaining four (4)
successive ten-year periods of the term hereof, such
annual rental payable as aforesaid shall be the
Apartment Owner's proportionate share of the total
annual rental ("total annual rent" established for the
Land. Wherever it shall herein provide for the
Apartment Owner's "proportionate share", the Apartment
Owner's share shall be equal to the total multiplied
by the Apartment Owner's then percentage undivided
interest in the Land. The total annual rental for
 each such period for the Land shall be equal to its
fair market rental value, but not less than seven
percent (7%), or the customary lessor's percentage
return (as hereinafter defined) on land, whichever
percentage is higher, of the fair market value of the
Land (exclusive of any buildings or other
improvements) at the beginning of each such period
valued as though the Land had not been leased, but
encumbered by its existing use, as shall be agreed
upon in writing between a majority of the Board of
Directors . . . of the Association of Apartment Owners
. . . and Developer, and in any event not less than
the total annual rent for any preceding rental
period. . . .
In the event Developer and the Board of
Directors are unable to agree upon the fair market
 
13
  
Rent for the Parking Spaces is treated differently
 
under Subsection 1A of the Conveyance Document:
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
rental value of the Land ninety (90) days prior to the
commencement of any of said periods, then the same
shall be determined by three impartial real estate
appraisers . . . .
 
1A. Additional Rent
 . Apartment Owner
acknowledges that he has additional use of the Land by
reason of his ownership of the parking stalls appurtenant to
his Apartment and agrees to pay additional rent for the
undivided interest in the Land demised hereby equal to the
number of parking stalls conveyed by I(c) above multiplied
by:
 
(a) $2.50 per month for the period
commencing on the Effective Date hereof and ending on
April 26, 1989;
 
(b) $3.50 per month for the next ten (10)
years of said term ending on April 26, 1999;
 
(c) $4.50 per month for the next ten (10)
years of said term ending April 26, 2009;
 
(d) $5.50 per month for the next five (5)
years of said term ending April 26, 2014;
 
payable together with the rent provided in Section 1
above. . . .
 
Subsection 1A does not separately provide for the determination
 
of new additional rent obligations after April 26, 2014.
 
The rent redetermination provision in Subsection 1(e)
 
provides a very specific method for determining an owner's
 proportionate share of the total annual rental established for
 the Land—that is, for determining "such annual rental payable as
 aforesaid." (Emphasis added). An Apartment Owner's
 "proportionate share" is equal to the total annual rent
 multiplied by the Apartment Owner's then percentage undivided
 interest in the Land. (Emphasis added). Thus, the amount of a
 new rental obligation, pursuant to the mechanisms in Subsection
 1(e), is a function of the owner's percentage undivided interest
 in the Land—for Unit 3206, that number is 0.5107%—multiplied by
 the fair market rental value of the land. On the other hand, the
 additional rent payable by the Apartment Owner for the Parking
 Stalls is not a function of his or her percentage of undivided
 interest in the land, and additional rent is treated differently
 from annual rent, as additional rent is "payable together with
 the rent provided in Section 1 above." In light of this method
 
14
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
of determination, the Circuit Court did not clearly err when it
 
found that the Furuyas' obligation to pay maintenance fees and
 lease rent after 2014 is "purely a function of the percentage of
 common interest" assigned to Unit 3206. 
"As a general rule, it is the function of courts to
 
construe and enforce contracts made by the parties, and not to
 make or alter them[.]" Scotella v. Osgood, 4 Haw. App. 20, 24,
 
659 P.2d 73, 76 (1983). "[T]erms of a contract should be
 interpreted according to their plain, ordinary and accepted use
 in common speech, unless the contract indicates a different
 meaning." Amfac, Inc. v. Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw.
 
85, 108–09, 839 P.2d 10, 24 (1992) (quoting Azer v. Myers, 8 Haw.
 App. 86, 123, 793 P.2d 1189, 1212 (1990)). "We seek to interpret
 the contract in a manner that makes the contract internally
 consistent." Accord Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison v. Telex Corp. ,
 
602 F.2d 866, 872 (9th Cir. 1979).
 
Here, examining the overall structure of the Conveyance
 
Document, the rent determination provision in Subsection 1(e)
 applies only to annual rental payments and not to additional
 rental payments for the Parking Stalls. 
Subsection 1(e) does not
 
provide any mechanism for determining the value of an individual
 parking space, and we do not infer from anything in the document
 that the rent for the Parking Stalls was to be reevaluated
 according to their fair market value or by any other metric.
9
 
Furthermore, the Conveyance Document's silence on the subject of
 rental prices for the Parking Stalls after April 26, 2014,
 severely undercuts the AOAO's position and supports the Circuit
 Court's conclusion that "the absence of provision [sic] providing
 for 'additional rent' for the parking stalls after April 26, 2014
 
9/
 Our reasoning is consistent with and supported by the Circuit
Court's unchallenged FOF 20 in the March 2010 FOF/COL, which reads: "Per the
Declaration the 106 parking stalls appurtenant to Unit 3206 were not assigned
a percentage common interest in the common elements." FOFs that are not
 
challenged on appeal are binding on the appellate court. See, e.g., AlohaCare
 
v. Ito, 126 Hawai' i 326, 353, 271 P.3d 621, 648 (2012); In re Lock Revocable 
Living Trust, 109 Hawai' i 146, 154, 123 P.3d 1241, 1249 (2005); Okada Trucking 
Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai' i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002). 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
was necessarily intended by the original parties."10 Thus, the
 
Circuit Court did not err in finding and concluding that
 
Subsection 1A was not subject to the rent renegotiation provision
 in Subsection 1(e).
 
The AOAO argues that the Circuit Court erred when it
 
entered FOF 56 of the March 2010 FOF/COL because it equated an
 Apartment Owner's undivided interest in the land with his or her
 undivided interest in the common elements. However, as the
 Circuit Court correctly concluded, Section II of the Conveyance
 Document states that the Apartment Owner leases from the
 Developer "an undivided interest, equal to Apartment Owner's
 common interest in the Common Elements appurtenant to the
 Apartment as set forth in the Declaration . . . in and to the
 Land[.]" Thus, the percentages assigned for the common elements
 and the Land are equivalent, the Circuit Court did not clearly
 err in making its related findings of fact and conclusions of
 law, and the AOAO's argument is without merit.
 
Finally, the AOAO argues that the Circuit Court adopted
 
an absurd interpretation of the Conveyance Document. However,
 the absurd-construction doctrine only applies if a contract is
 "susceptible to two constructions." Amfac, Inc., 74 Haw. at 110,
 
839 P.2d at 25. Because we hold that the Conveyance Document is
 not susceptible to two constructions, we decline to hold that the
 Circuit Court adopted an absurd interpretation of the Conveyance
 Document.
11
 
10/
 The AOAO argues that the Circuit Court erred in "speculating" that
the developer intended to give up the right to collect lease rent for the
Parking Stalls after April 26, 2014. Even if the Circuit Court improperlyspeculated as to what the developer intended, the AOAO fails to present anyevidence of a contrary intention, and we must consider the plain, unambiguous
language of the Conveyance Document. See Williams v. Aona, 121 Hawai' i 1, 15,
210 P.3d 501, 515 (2009) ("The court should look no further than the four
corners of the document to determine whether an ambiguity exists."). 
11/
 We observe that other than its claim of equitable
estoppel/reformation (Count VII in its Counterclaim), the AOAO did not assertother equitable claims, such as unjust enrichment or quantum meruit.Moreover, and importantly, because the AOAO did not raise these arguments on
appeal, we deem them waived. See Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4); Alvarez Family 
Trust v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Kaanapali Alii, 121 Hawai' i 474, 488,
221 P.3d 452, 466 (2009) ("It is well-established in this jurisdiction that,
where a party does not raise specific issues on appeal . . . the issues aredeemed waived and need not be considered.").

2.	 Even if the Circuit Court erred in concluding that
the AOAO had ratified the terms of the Conveyance
Document, that error would be harmless (Point of
Error 5)
 
The AOAO argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
concluding in the March 2010 FOF/COL that the AOAO was deemed to
 
have ratified the terms of the Conveyance Document because it
 unreasonably delayed in bringing a claim for reformation of the
 Conveyance Document. Reformation is available if (1) there was a
 valid agreement between the parties expressing their true
 intentions; (2) the written agreement did not reflect the true
 intentions of the parties; and (3) this failure to reflect the
 true intentions was caused by the parties' mutual mistake or a
 unilateral mistake accompanied by fraud or inequitable conduct by
 the other party. See Norwest Bank Minn., N.A. v. Ode, 615 N.W.2d
 91, 95 (Minn. Ct. App. 2000); see also State v. Kahua Ranch,
 Ltd., 47 Haw. 28, 33, 384 P.2d 581, 585 (1963) (noting the
 general rule that reformation may be had when the written
 instrument does not, through a mutual mistake of fact, conform to
 the intention of the parties to the instrument). 
Here, the Circuit Court concluded in COL 19 that the
 
AOAO failed to show "that a prior agreement specifically relating
 to the post-2014 'additional rent' for the parking stalls was
 ever made and excluded from the [Conveyance Document] for Unit
 3206." As the AOAO did not challenge COL 19, it stands, and the
 AOAO has not shown reversible error in the Circuit Court's
 issuance of the related COLs 37–39. See Amfac, Inc., 74 Haw. at
 
125, 839 P.2d at 31 (unchallenged conclusions of law are treated
 as binding on appeal).
 
3.	 The AOAO is not entitled to statutory lease rent
for the Parking Stalls (Point of Error 6)
 
The AOAO argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
concluding in COL 41 of the March 2010 FOF/COL that HRS § 514C-22
 
("Section 514C-22") did not require the Furuyas to pay lease rent
 for the Parking Stalls after 2014 upon their failure to acquire
 the leased fee interest to the Parking Stalls. Section 514C-22
 provides:
 
17
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(c) No condominium unit lessee shall be compelled to
purchase the leased fee in such condominium unit and
acquired from the lessor by the association of owners, but
may instead pay lease rent to the association together with
the lessee's share of the common expenses incurred in
acquiring the leased fee interest in the condominium units
in the project including any debt associated therewith.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 514C-22(c) (Supp. 2012). Neither the statute
 
nor the AOAO's argument, however, suggests that the legislature
 
intended to create a statutory right to lease rent that could, in
 essence, modify or destroy the agreed-upon contractual rights of
 the parties. Therefore, we hold that the Circuit Court did not
 err in rejecting this argument. 
B.	 The Furuyas' cross-appeal
12
 
The Furuyas' first point of error, relating to the
 
Circuit Court's oversight in not making findings of fact and
 conclusions of law in support of its decision relating to the
 Partial Dismissal Order, has been resolved by this court's Order
 for Temporary Remand to the Circuit Court, filed October 25,
 2012. We address the remainder of the points below.
 
1.	 The DROA for Unit 3206 is not enforceable (Points
of Error 2, 6, 7, and 8)
 
The Furuyas argue in Points of Error 2, 6, 7, and 8
 
that the Circuit Court erred in concluding that the DROA for Unit
 
3206 was not an enforceable contract. The Furuyas' contentions
 pertain to the Partial Dismissal Order, the March 2010 FOF/COL,
 and the December 2012 FOF/COL, and argue that the Circuit Court
 erred: in dismissing Counts I and II of the Complaint for breach
 of the DROA and specific enforcement, and finding and concluding
 that the DROA for Unit 3206 is not an enforceable contract; in
 finding that the AOAO offered the Furuyas the opportunity to
 purchase the leased fee interests associated with Unit 3206 and
 
12/
 In the January 3, 2013 Order Granting Motion to Supplement Record
on Appeal, this court ordered that the Furuyas "may file a supplemental reply
brief, not to exceed 5 pages, exclusive of indexes, appendices, and statements
of related cases." (Emphasis added). In their March 5, 2013 Errata to
Supplemental Reply Brief of Plaintiffs-Appellees Only to Re Insert Page
Numbers on the Bottom of the Pages Inadvertently Removed During Conversion,
the Furuyas submitted a supplemental reply brief that was seven pages in
length. In light of the terms of our order, we will not consider pages six
and seven of the Furuyas' supplemental reply brief.
 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the Parking Stalls; in finding that "[a]t first, the Furuyas
 
attempted to purchase the fee interest for 3206 without the
 parking stalls, however they were unsuccessful in doing so"; and
 in finding that "the Furuyas attempted to sell their leasehold
 interest in the 106 stalls to the AOAO, however these attempts
 also failed."
 
We hold that the Furuyas have not shown error. In the
 
December 2012 FOF/COL, the Circuit Court justified its ultimate
 conclusion upon, among other things, the fact that the AOAO had
 not signed the DROA for Unit 3206 and, thus, had not accepted the
 Furuyas' "offer" to purchase Unit 3206. The AOAO did not sign
 the section of the DROA entitled "Acceptance," which states: "The
 Association agrees to sell the Property to the Buyer or its
 designee at the price and upon the terms set forth herein,
 including the Additional Terms attached hereto." The plain
 language of the DROA for Unit 3206 indicates that Clarence Furuya
 was making an offer and that the AOAO would ultimately have to
 accept that offer to create a binding contract. Therefore, the
 Circuit Court did not err in finding and concluding that the AOAO
 did not accept the DROA, and that the Furuyas subsequently failed
 to purchase the leased fee interests associated with Unit 3206
 and the Parking Stalls. Likewise, the Circuit Court did not
 clearly err in finding that the Furuyas unsuccessfully attempted
 to purchase the fee interest for 3206 without the parking stalls.
 
The Furuyas present three primary arguments in support
 
of their contention that the Circuit Court erred in concluding
 that the DROA for Unit 3206 is not binding: (a) the Restated
 Bylaws required the AOAO to offer the leased fee interest in the
 land to the unit owner first and the AOAO indicated that it was
 sending Clarence Furuya a contract; (b) the AOAO admitted in
 pleadings that it had accepted the DROA for Unit 3206; and (c) in
 a deposition, AOAO director Foil Craver ("Craver") admitted that
 a deal had been made and the parties were ready to close. 
(a) The Furuyas misinterpret the Restated Bylaws,
 
under which the Board "shall have the powers and duties necessary
 for the administration of the affairs of the Association and may
 do all acts and things except such as by law, the Declaration or
 
19
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
these Bylaws may not be delegated to the Board of Directors by
 
the Apartment Owners." One of the Board's powers is
 "[p]urchasing or leasing or otherwise acquiring in the name of
 the Board of Directors or its nominee, corporate or otherwise, on
 behalf of all Apartment Owners, any apartments[.]" Furthermore,
 the Board is authorized to sell the leased fee interest in the
 land to the apartment owners or, if the interest remains unsold,
 to any lessee or other interested third party. 
The Furuyas incorrectly contend that Section 2(s)(5)
 
requires the AOAO to sell the leased fee interest. The Restated
 Bylaws specifically provide that the Board has the power to
 acquire apartment units on behalf of the apartment owners and
 that there may be situations where the Board would acquire a
 portion of the lease fee interest to the land on behalf of the
 AOAO. While Section 2(s)(5) states that the Board has the
 authority to sell the leased fee interest to the lessee of the
 apartment unit first, nothing mandates that the AOAO sell the
 apartment unit at all. Section 2(s)(5) simply establishes the
 Board's authority to purchase and re-sell the fee interest; it
 does not require it to do so. Thus, we reject the Furuyas'
 interpretation of the Restated Bylaws.
 
Furthermore, the April 23, 1996 Pacific Monarch Fee
 
Purchase document was used to determine whether unit owners
 intended to purchase their leased fee interest. It specifically
 states: "This is NOT a contract for the purchase of your leased
 fee interest." While the document stated that a contract would
 be sent to the unit owner shortly, it did not state that the
 contract would be an "offer."
 
(b) The Furuyas also argue that the AOAO admitted 
its acceptance of the DROA for Unit 3206 in its answer to the Complaint and had counterclaimed for breach of the DROA. While an admission of fact in a pleading is a binding judicial admission, Lee v. Puamana Cmty. Ass'n, 109 Hawai
'i 561, 573, 128 
P.3d 874, 886 (2006), such an argument must be timely raised, see Dallas Transit Co. v. Young, 370 S.W.2d 6, 11 (Tex. Civ. App. 1963). Where a party purports to make an admission in its pleadings, the subject of which nevertheless becomes in dispute, 
20
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the other party cannot avail itself of that admission on appeal
 
if it did not first seek to do so below. See id. Indeed, a
 
trial court cannot be expected to independently recognize the
 significance of any particular paragraph in the case pleadings;
 it must at times rely on the parties.
 
Despite the admission, the AOAO did not treat the issue 
of offer and acceptance of the DROA for Unit 3206 as settled, and the Furuyas did not argue that it was settled pursuant to a judicial admission. In its June 1, 2009 trial brief, in fact, the AOAO specifically argued that the DROA for Unit 3206 was not enforceable because it was never accepted by the AOAO. Similarly, the Furuyas' trial brief failed to raise the issue. When the AOAO moved for dismissal on June 24, 2009, the Furuyas did not contend that the AOAO had already admitted acceptance of the DROA. Rather, the parties contested the issue of offer and acceptance on the evidence, not on the pleadings. Having failed to assert an argument premised on a judicial admission before the trial court, the Furuyas have waived the opportunity to do so here. Arquette v. State, 128 Hawai
'i 423, 442 n.24, 290 P.3d 
493, 512 n.24 (2012) (an argument not raised at trial is waived on appeal). 
(c) Finally, in light of the plain language of the
 
DROA, the lack of the AOAO's countersignature is substantial
 evidence that the AOAO had not accepted the DROA. Craver's
 deposition testimony that "they had made the deal" does not
 demonstrate error.
 
Therefore, the Furuyas have failed to show that the
 
Circuit Court erred in finding and concluding that there was no
 enforceable contract for the purchase of Unit 3206. 
2.	 The Circuit Court did not err as to the claims for
 
injunctive relief, declaratory relief and a
declaration of ultra vires actions (Points of
Error 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10)
 
The Furuyas argue that if the DROA was unenforceable,
 
the AOAO had failed to offer the leased fee interest to the
 
Furuyas as it was required to under the Restated Bylaws; the AOAO
 could not have refused to close on the sale of the leased fee
 
21
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
interest for Unit 3206 based on the "best interests of the
 
association"; and the Restated Bylaws prohibited the AOAO from
 retaining the leased fee interest because it was not an
 "interested Lessee" in the association or "other interested third
 party." 
The Furuyas' arguments arise from several documents. 
The issues raised relating to the Partial Dismissal Order and the
 subsequent December 2012 FOF/COL involve: the Circuit Court's
 dismissal of Counts IV and IX of the Complaint, relating to
 injunctive relief and alleged ultra vires actions; its conclusion
 that the Board of Directors acted within its authority; its
 partial dismissal of Count V, the Furuyas' claim for declaratory
 relief, and its finding, concluding, and declaring that the AOAO
 was entitled to retain possession and ownership of the leased fee
 interests in Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls. 
Other arguments relate to the Circuit Court's finding
 
in the March 2010 FOF/COL and the December 2012 FOF/COL that the
 AOAO offered the Furuyas the opportunity to purchase the leased
 fee interests associated with Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls,
 and the Circuit Court's "declaring," in the March 2010 FOF/COL,
 that the AOAO was the rightful owner of the leased fee interests
 that were not purchased by the Furuyas. The Furuyas also
 challenge the April 6, 2010 Judgment, contending that the Circuit
 Court erred by declaring that the AOAO is the legal and
 beneficial owner of the leased fee interests to Unit 3206 and the
 Parking Stalls and that it "is not legally or morally obligated
 to sell the leased fee interests to the Apartment Unit 3206 and
 the 106 Parking Stalls to Plaintiffs." 
As to all of these arguments, for the same reason that
 
we have concluded that the DROA is unenforceable, the Circuit
 Court's findings that the AOAO made an offer to the Furuyas for
 the purchase of Unit 3206 are clearly erroneous. However, as
 stated above, see supra Part III.B.1.a, we reject the Furuyas'
 premise that the Restated Bylaws required the AOAO to offer, or
 to not retain, the leased fee interest. Accordingly, their
 arguments fail. The Circuit Court thus did not err in dismissing
 the Furuyas' injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and ultra
 
22

vires claims, finding that the AOAO offered the Furuyas the
 
opportunity to purchase the leased fee interests associated with
 Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls, and concluding that the AOAO
 was entitled to retain possession and ownership of the leased fee
 interests in Unit 3206 and the Parking Stalls.
 
3.	 The Circuit Court did not err in dismissing the
Furuyas' promissory-estoppel claim (Point of Error
4)
 
The Furuyas contend that the Circuit Court erred by
 
dismissing the promissory and equitable estoppel claims in the
 
Complaint in the Partial Dismissal Order, and finding and
 concluding that the Furuyas' reliance on the AOAO's promises,
 assurances, or actions was not reasonable. The Furuyas also
 contend that the Circuit Court erred in finding in the December
 2012 FOF/COL that the AOAO was not obligated to close the sale on
 Unit 3206.

The Furuyas argue that "[e]ven if somehow the DROA is
 
not enforceable, the doctrine of [promissory] estoppel should be
 applied." The Circuit Court disagreed, dismissing the Furuyas'
 claim on the grounds that any reliance on the part of the Furuyas
 was unreasonable. We agree that there was no reasonable reliance
 by the Furuyas on any promise by the AOAO, and that no claim for
 promissory estoppel lies.
 
The elements of promissory estoppel, as distilled from
 
the R
ESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 90 (1981), are:
 
(1) There must be a promise;
 
(2) The promisor must, at the time he or she made the
promise, foresee that the promisee would rely upon the
promise (foreseeability);
 
(3) The promisee does in fact rely upon the promisor's
promise; and
 
(4) Enforcement of the promise is necessary to avoid
injustice.

329, 337–38, 922 P.2d 942, 950–51 (1996) ("Section 90 can be
 
reduced to [these] elements . . . .")). If a promisee's reliance
 is unreasonable, however, then a trial court can fairly conclude
 that the refusal to enforce the promise will not lead to
 injustice. R
ESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 90 cmt. b.
 
Despite conflicting evidence and testimony as to which
 
party first backed out of the sale of the leased fee interest to
 Unit 3206 and the appurtenant Parking Stalls, the Circuit Court,
 in its December 2012 FOF/COL, found that it was the Furuyas that
 had done so. Relying in part on that basis, the Circuit Court
 denied the Furuyas' promissory-estoppel claim because the court
 concluded that the Furuyas' alleged reliance on any promise by
 the AOAO that it would sell the fee interest was unreasonable;
 therefore, it did not address the other elements of promissory­estoppel.
14 The Circuit Court stated that any reliance by the
 
Furuyas was unreasonable because the Furuyas (a) "voluntarily
 decided not to purchase the leased fee interest to the Parking
 Stalls," (b) "voluntarily failed and refused to fund the escrow
 account," and (c) "voluntarily offered to sell the parking stalls
 to the AOAO[.]" 
We agree. The Circuit Court's justifications support 
its conclusion that any reliance was unreasonable. To the extent the Furuyas acted in reliance on either the DROA or any AOAO statements regarding the leased fee conversion process, we fail to see how their decision to forego the purchase reflects a reasonable reliance such that promissory estoppel is available as a matter of law. See Ravelo by Ravelo v. Hawaii Cnty., 66 Haw. 
194, 199, 658 P.2d 883, 887 (1983) (plaintiffs exhibited reliance on promise of police employment through the quitting of their jobs and moving to the island of Hawai
'i); Morgado v. Hamada, No. 
29026, 2009 WL 1071218, at *1 n.3 (Haw. App. Apr. 22, 2009) (SDO) (phone calls from prospective high school coaching hire to members of coaching staff did not show reliance upon conditional offer of employment). 
14/
 We express no opinion on whether the other elements of promissory
estoppel have been satisfied.

Therefore, the Circuit Court did not err in dismissing
 
Count VI of the Complaint, and we affirm that portion of the
 
Judgment.
 
4.	 Points relating to two laundry parking stalls
 
The Furuyas argue that they established their claims
 
for conversion and unjust enrichment relating to two laundry
 parking stalls but that the Circuit Court "improperly applied
 affirmative defenses." 
a.	 The Furuyas' waiver argument is, itself,
waived (Point of Error 11)
 
The Furuyas contend that the Circuit Court erred in
 
finding that they had waived their claim for conversion or were
 
otherwise barred by the statute of limitations. In support, the
 Furuyas cite to a statute defining the term "limited common
 element" and the case of Penney v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of
 Hale Kaanapali, 70 Haw. 469, 776 P.2d 393 (1989). Although they
 characterize the instant case as a "reverse Penney" case, they do
 so without explaining how Penney, or its purported reverse
 holding, pertains to waiver. As the Furuyas do not present any
 discernable argument on the issue of waiver, we deem the issue to
 be waived. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). 
b.	 The Circuit Court abused its discretion in
 
applying estoppel by acquiescence to the
Furuyas' claims regarding the AOAO's future
use of the laundry-related parking stalls
(Points of Error 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17)
 
The Furuyas' Points of Error 12 through 17 all arise
 
from the March 2010 FOF/COL and the December 2012 FOF/COL. The
 
arguments challenge: the Circuit Court's identification of two
 parking stalls used in connection with laundry services; its
 finding and conclusion that the two parking stalls "were assigned
 and that the stalls created the laundry"; its finding that the
 Furuyas acquired the two laundry-related stalls "subject to their
 known, obvious, and accepted use by the AOAO without
 compensation"; and its finding that the Furuyas assented to the
 use of the two parking stalls through their inaction. Other
 
25
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
issues raised pertain to the Circuit Court's conclusion that the
 
Furuyas acquiesced or consented to the use of the two laundry-
related parking stalls, its statement of the elements of the
 affirmative defense of estoppel by acquiescence, and its
 conclusion that the Furuyas are estopped from asserting a claim
 and seeking damages for the past and future use of the two
 laundry-related parking stalls. 
Ordinarily, the March 2010 FOF/COL's findings of fact 
are reviewed for clear error, and its conclusions of law are reviewed under the right/wrong standard.  Kewalo Ocean 
Activities, 124 Hawai
'i at 317, 243 P.3d at 277. However, when 
reviewing trial courts sitting in equity, appellate courts grant considerable deference.  See Leaver v. Grose, 610 P.2d 1262, 1263-64 (Utah 1980)("[U]nder ordinary circumstances, a reviewing court will grant considerable deference to a trial court sitting in equity, reversing its disposition of the case only in the presence of manifest injustice.") 
The Furuyas argue that the Circuit Court erroneously
 
found that the Furuyas' claim for unjust enrichment "was barred
 by the affirmative defense of equitable estoppel." In the March
 2010 FOF/COL, the Circuit Court rejected the Furuyas' unjust-
enrichment claim relating to the two laundry parking stalls on
 the grounds that the Furuyas were "estopped from asserting a
 claim and seeking damages for the past and future use of the two
 parking stalls" because "[f]or more than 20 years, the [Furuyas]
 have known about and permitted the open and obvious use of the 2
 stalls for the laundry facilities [and] [t]he AOAO has reasonably
 relied to its detriment on the use of these two stalls in support
 of its laundry operation." Specifically, the Circuit Court
 relied on a theory of "estoppel by acquiescence." 
"Hawai
'i recognizes the theory of quasi-estoppel, which 
is a species of equitable estoppel which has its basis in election, waiver, acquiescence, or even acceptance of benefits and which precludes a party from asserting to another's disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a position previously taken by the party." Cvitanovich-Dubie v. Dubie, 123 Hawai
'i 
266, 276, 231 P.3d 983, 993 (App. 2010) (quoting Anderson v. 
26
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Anderson, 59 Haw. 575, 589, 585 P.2d 938, 947 (1978)) (brackets
 
and internal quotation marks omitted). "No concealment or
 misrepresentation of existing facts on the one side, no ignorance
 on the other, are necessary ingredients." Hartmann v.
 
Bertelmann, 39 Haw. 619, 628 (Haw. Terr. 1952) (quoting Montclair
 Trust Co. v. Russell Co., 39 A.2d 641, 643 (N.J. Ch. 1944)). 
Furthermore, "[u]nlike equitable estoppel, an estoppel by
 acquiescence does not require a showing of detrimental reliance
 or prejudice." 31 C.J.S. Estoppel and Waiver § 175 (2008). In
 essence, quasi-estoppel may apply when a trial court finds that a
 party's conduct "was so inconsistent with her present claim that,
 in equity, [that party] should be estopped to make such a claim." 
See Anderson, 59 Haw. at 590, 585 P.2d at 947.
 
Here, the Circuit Court found that as of July 1985,
 
Clarence Furuya knew or should have known that two of the Parking
 Stalls were being used for the laundry facility and that he was
 not receiving compensation for this use. The Circuit Court also
 found that the Furuyas did not object to such use until the
 filing of this lawsuit. Furthermore, the Furuyas paid the
 additional rent associated with those stalls without complaint;
 i.e., an affirmative act. Given the deference appellate courts
 give to trial courts sitting in equity, see, e.g., Leaver, 610
 P.2d at 1263-64, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion
 in applying estoppel by acquiescence to the Furuyas' claims
 regarding the AOAO's use of the laundry-related parking stalls
 before filing of the Complaint.
 
While the Furuyas are estopped by acquiescence from
 
making unjust-enrichment claims for past benefits received by the
 AOAO from the laundry-related parking stalls before filing of the
 Complaint, they are not precluded from actions or barred from
 recovery on claims regarding the use of the stalls after filing
 of the Complaint. With the filing of this lawsuit, the Furuyas
 have now objected, and no longer acquiesce, to the AOAO's use of
 the laundry-related parking stalls. Accordingly, estoppel by
 acquiescence does not apply to the Furuyas' claims for unjust
 enrichment regarding the use of the laundry-related parking
 stalls after the filing of the Complaint. See, e.g., Maui
 
27
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Aggregates, Inc. v. Reeder, 50 Haw. 608, 610, 446 P.2d 174, 176 
("The basis of recovery on quantum meruit is that a party has received a benefit from another which it is unjust for him to retain without paying therefor."); Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai
'i 490, 502, 100 P.3d 60, 72 (2004) 
("One who receives a benefit is of course enriched, and he would be unjustly enriched if its retention would be unjust." (citing R
ESTATEMENT OF RESTITUTION  § 1 cmt. a (1937) (emphasis removed)). 
We conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in estopping the Furuyas from asserting a claim and seeking damages for the use of the two laundry-related parking stalls after filing of the Complaint, and remand for further proceedings. 
5.	 The identity of the prevailing party is settled
(Points of Error 19 and 20)
 
The Furuyas contend that the Circuit Court erred in 
granting attorneys' fees and costs to the AOAO and denying 
attorneys' fees and costs to the Furuyas. In general, "a prevailing party is a party who has prevailed on the disputed main issue, even though not to the extent of the party's original contention." Queen Emma Found. v. Tatibouet, 123 Hawai
'i 500, 
511, 236 P.3d 1236, 1247 (App. 2010) (quoting Food Pantry, Ltd. v. Waikiki Bus. Plaza, Inc., 58 Haw. 606, 620, 575 P.2d 869, 879
 (1978)) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted);
 Tradewinds Hotel, Inc. v. Cocharn, 8 Haw. App. 256, 269, 799 P.2d
 60, 68 (1990).
 
Here, the disputed main issues in the case related to
 
the parties' claims to be entitled to own the leased fee interest
 to Unit 3206, which includes the appurtenant Parking Stalls. 
We
 
have vacated the March 2010 FOF/COL only as it pertains to the
 Furuyas' claim for unjust enrichment from the use of the laundry-
related parking stalls after filing of the Complaint. As we have
 otherwise affirmed, declaring that the AOAO has no obligation to
 sell the leased fee interest in Unit 3206 (and the Parking
 Stalls), the prevailing party is a settled matter. Accordingly,
 we affirm the Circuit Court's granting of attorneys' fees and
 
28
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
costs to the AOAO and denial of attorneys' fees and costs to the
 
Furuyas.
 
IV. Conclusion
 
We, therefore, vacate the portion of the March 2, 2010
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order related to the
 
Circuit Court's findings and conclusions that the Furuyas were
 estopped by acquiescence with regard to the AOAO's use of the
 laundry-related parking stalls after filing of the Complaint. We
 otherwise affirm. We remand for further proceedings consistent
 with this opinion.
