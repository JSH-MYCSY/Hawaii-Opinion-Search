On appeal, Mother appears to raise the following points
 
of error2:
 
(1) The family court abused its discretion in awarding
 
sole physical and legal custody to Father based on evidence
 
provided by Prathiba Eastwood, PhD. (Dr. Eastwood); Custody
 
Evaluator Thomas Haia (CE); and John Wingert, PhD. (Dr. Wingert). 
(2) The family court abused its discretion in awarding
 
monthly child support to Father. 
(3) The family court abused its discretion when it
 
denied Mother's demand for discovery.
 
(4) The family court abused its discretion in ordering
 
Mother to reimburse Father $10,000 of the $20,000 she withdrew
 
from the parties' joint bank account.
 
(5) The family court abused its discretion when it
 
denied Mother's November 3, 2009 oral motion to continue the
 
trial. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Mother's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) The family court did not abuse its discretion in
 
awarding sole physical and legal custody to Father based on
 
evidence provided by Dr. Eastwood, the CE, and Dr. Wingert. In
 
2
 Mother fails to comply with HRAP Rule 28(b) in several respects.
Mother fails to include a Statement of Points of Error and Standards of 
Review, to identify Findings of Fact (FOFs) or Conclusions of Law (COLs)objected to, to cite to the record, to identify legal authorities relied on,and to provide a transcript of the November 9 and 10, 2009 trial on which the
FOFs and COLs were based, as well as from which the Divorce Decree emanated.
She also fails to provide a Statement of Jurisdiction, in violation of HRAPRule 12.1. Mother also attached numerous documents to her opening brief thatwere not part of the record on appeal, in violation of HRAP Rule 28(b)(10).
Insofar as any appendices are not part of the record, they are disregarded.In spite of the numerous violations, we nevertheless attempt to review this
case for any meritorious claims. See Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
»i 
225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the first paragraph of Mother's opening brief, she "challenges
 
the overtly biased CE report"; "the testimony offered by
 
[Dr. Eastwood], who spoke beyond her area of expertise and
 
training"; and the "[p]sychological [e]valuation offered by
 
[Dr. Wingert], who bases his recommendations on a mood disorder
 
that was never diagnosed." 
Father offered the CE report and Dr. Wingert's
 
psychological evaluations of Mother and Father into evidence as
 
Exhibit No. 29 on November 9, 2009. The family court received
 
the report and evaluations with no objection by Mother. "The
 
general rule is that an issue which was not raised in the lower
 
court will not be considered on appeal. An appellate court will
 
deviate from this rule only when justice so requires." Hong v.
 
Kong, 5 Haw. App. 174, 177, 683 P.2d 833, 837 (1984) (internal
 citations omitted). Here, justice does not require us to deviate
 
from this rule.
 
The family court received Dr. Eastwood's curriculum 
vitae into evidence, again with no objection, as Father's Exhibit 
No. 30. Because Mother failed to provide a copy of the 
transcript of the November 9 and 10, 2009 trial, we do not know 
in what capacity Dr. Eastwood testified. "The burden is upon 
appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in 
the record, and he or she has the responsibility of providing an 
adequate transcript." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt , 80 Hawai» i 
225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (citation, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Without the transcript of the 
November 9 and 10, 2009 trial, we have no basis upon which to 
review Mother's contention that the family court abused its 
discretion in admitting the reports and testimony on which, among 
other things, it based its award of custody to Father. 
(2) Mother fails to make any argument regarding the
 
award of monthly support to Father in her opening or reply brief.

An appellate court "may disregard a particular contention if the 
appellant makes no discernible argument in support of that 
position." In re Guardianship of Carlsmith , 113 Hawai» i 236, 
246, 151 P.3d 717, 727 (2007) (citation, internal quotation 
marks, and brackets omitted); see also  Hawai» i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived."). Thus, Mother's monthly support claim is deemed 
waived. 
(3) Mother also fails to make any argument regarding 
her assertion that she was denied her demand for discovery. 
Because Mother makes no discernible argument, this point is 
waived. In re Guardianship of Carlsmith , 113 Hawai» i at 246, 151 
P.3d at 727; HRAP Rule 28 (b)(7). 
(4) The family court did not err in ordering Mother to
 
reimburse Father $10,000 of the $20,000 she withdrew from the
 
parties' joint bank account. Mother states only that she
 
"disputes having to pay $10,000 to [Father] for money she
 
withdrew from one of the bank accounts[,]" and she "requests
 
relief from the imposed $10,000 payment to [Father] since most,
 
if not all, of those funds were used directly for [Son's] care." 
Mother cites to no facts established in the record or legal
 
authority to support her objection to the reimbursement
 
requirement. As previously indicated, points not argued are
 
waived.
 
(5) The family court did not abuse its discretion when
 
it denied Mother's November 3, 2009 oral motion to continue the
 
trial. On July 30, 2009, the family court set trial for the week
 
of November 9, 2009. Mother's former counsel filed a motion on
 
October 9, 2009 for leave to withdraw as counsel and to continue
 
trial to give Mother time to secure substitute counsel. Counsel
 
indicated that she and her firm were notified on October 1, 2009,
 
of their discharge as Mother's counsel. On October 21, 2009, new
 
counsel filed a notice of appearance with the family court,

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"provided that the trial date herein is continued[.]" On 
October 22, 2009, the family court granted the former counsel's 
motion for leave to withdraw as counsel, but denied the request 
to continue the trial date. New counsel was present at the 
October 22, 2009 hearing. Thereafter, Mother was represented at 
trial by new counsel and does not assert or demonstrate any 
particular prejudice from having new counsel represent her at 
trial. "[I]t is well-established that the granting or denial of 
a continuance is a matter that is addressed to the sound 
discretion of the trial court and is not subject to reversal on 
appeal absent a showing of abuse." Kam Fui Trust v. Brandhorst , 
77 Hawai» i 320, 324, 884 P.2d 383, 387 (App. 1994) (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Mother has not 
established an abuse of discretion by the family court. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Decree Granting Absolute
 
Divorce and Awarding Child Custody" entered on February 4, 2010,
 
in the Family Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
