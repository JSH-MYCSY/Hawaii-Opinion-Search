GREGORY NAGAO, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(SPP NO. 09-1-0093 (CR NO. 94-1501))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Gregory Nagao (Nagao) appeals from 
the Order Denying Petition to Set Aside Judgment (Order Denying 
Petition) that was filed on April 6, 2009, in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 Nagao filed his Petition 
to Set Aside Judgment (Petition) pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of 
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40 (2006). The Circuit Court denied Nagao's Petition without a hearing, concluding that Nagao's claims were (1) previously ruled upon or waived pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(a)(3); (2) "patently frivolous and without a trace of support either in the record or from other evidence submitted" by Nagao; and (3) "failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted."

 The Honorable Dexter D. Del Rosario presided over the
proceedings relevant to this appeal.

On appeal, Nagao argues that because he raised a
 
colorable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Circuit
 
Court erred in denying his Petition without a hearing. We affirm
 the Circuit Court's Order Denying Petition. 
I.
 
On July 25, 1995, a jury found Nagao guilty of first
 
degree robbery with the use of a firearm (Count II) and
 possession of a prohibited firearm, namely, a short-barreled
 shotgun (Count III) in Cr. No. 94-1501. 
Nagao filed a motion for
 
sentencing as a young adult defendant. The prosecution moved for
 a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment based on Nagao's use a
 firearm and also moved for an extended term of life imprisonment
 as a multiple offender. On April 18, 1996, the Circuit Court
 sentenced Nagao to eight years of imprisonment on Count II as a
 young adult defendant and five years of imprisonment on Count
 III. The Circuit Court also imposed a mandatory minimum term of
 
imprisonment of five years. 
On appeal from the original judgment in Cr. No. 94­
1501, this court concluded that the Circuit Court had
 misapprehended the law in imposing the five-year term of
 imprisonment on Count III and the mandatory minimum term. State
 
v. Nagao, No. 19866 (Hawai' i App. Mar. 19, 1997) (memorandum 
opinion). We therefore vacated these sentences and remanded the case for resentencing. Id. On remand, the Circuit Court entered 
an amended judgment on February 4, 1998, which sentenced Nagao as a young adult defendant to eight years of imprisonment on Count II and four years of imprisonment on Count III. Nagao did not appeal from the February 4, 1998, amended judgment. 
On December 14, 2009, Nagao filed the instant Petition
 
seeking to "set aside the [amended] [j]udgment" and to "reset the
 case for a trial on the merits" based on the ineffective
 assistance of his trial counsel. Nagao argued that his trial
 counsel was ineffective for advising him that the only way to
 avoid deportation was to obtain an acquittal at trial. Nagao
 contended that this constituted ineffective assistance because if
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
he had pleaded guilty to the charges, instead of being convicted
 
after trial, he could have sought a waiver of deportation
 pursuant to Section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
 (INA). 
II.
 
For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the
 
Circuit Court did not err in denying the Nagao's Petition without
 a hearing.
 
(1) Before Nagao appealed from his original judgment,
 
his trial counsel withdrew and new counsel was appointed. 
Nagao's new counsel did not raise a claim that trial counsel was
 ineffective on direct appeal from the original judgment, and
 Nagao did not appeal from the February 4, 1998, amended judgment
 entered on remand. By failing to raise the claim of ineffective
 assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal from the original
 judgment and by failing to appeal from the amended judgment,
 Nagao waived the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel
 that he raised in his Petition. See HRPP Rule 40(a)(3).
 
(2) In addition, we conclude that Nagao did not raise a 
colorable claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in his Petition. A defendant who raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has the burden of satisfying a two-part test, which requires the defendant to show: "(1) that there were specific errors or omissions reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence; and (2) that such errors or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense." State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 
19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998). 
(a) Nagao has not shown specific errors reflecting his
 
trial counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence. Nagao
 contends that his conviction after trial rendered him ineligible
 to seek a discretionary waiver of deportation pursuant to Section
 212(c) of the INA (Section 212(c)), whereas he would have been
 able to seek such a waiver had he pleaded guilty to the charges. 
Based on this contention, Nagao argues that his trial counsel
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise Nagao that
 
he should plead guilty rather than go to trial. 
However, prior to the enactment of the Antiterrorism
 
and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and the Illegal
 Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) in
 1996, a defendant's eligibility for a waiver of deportation under
 Section 212(c) did not depend on whether the defendant pleaded
 guilty or was found guilty after trial. See Brooks v. Ashcroft,
 
283 F.3d 1268, 1273 (11th Cir. 2002), superseded by statute on
 other grounds as stated in Ferguson v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 563 F.3d
 1254, 1259 (11th Cir. 2009); Ponnapula v. Ashcroft, 373 F.3d 480,
 497-500 (3d Cir. 2004).
2 Prior to the AEDPA and the IIRIRA, 
immigrants who were deportable on the basis of a criminal
offense could apply for [Section] 212(c) relief so long as
they had lived in this country continuously for seven years.
Only those who had been convicted -- either by plea or at
trial -- of a crime that fell under the definition of an
 "aggravated felony," see 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) (1994), and
who had served a prison term of at least five years were
statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief. See 8
 
U.S.C. § 1182(c) (1994). 
Ponnapula, 373 F.3d at 486.
 
In April 1996, Congress enacted the AEDPA which made
 
aliens convicted of an increased range of offenses, including
 
aggravated felonies regardless of the length of the sentence,
 ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation under
 Section 212(c). See id. at 482; INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289,
 
292, 297 (2001). In September 1996, Congress enacted the IIRIRA
 which expanded the definition of "aggravated felony," repealed
 Section 212(c), and replaced Section 212(c) with a new section
 that precluded the Attorney General from waiving deportation for
 anyone convicted of an aggravated felony. See St. Cyr, 533 U.S.
 
at 292, 297; Ponnapula, 373 F.3d at 482; Mattis v. Reno, 212 F.3d
 
2 Under Section 212(c), the United States Attorney General
had the authority to grant a discretionary waiver of deportation
to certain aliens who would otherwise have been subject to
deportation based on their criminal convictions. See INS v. St.
 
Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 294-97 (2001). 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
31, 38-39 & n.12 (1st Cir. 2000), overruled on other grounds, St.
 
Cyr, 533 U.S. 289. 
The 1996 enactment of the AEDPA and the IIRIRA raised
 
the question of whether aliens convicted of an aggravated felony
 before the AEDPA and the IIRIRA would be ineligible to seek a
 Section 212(c) waiver in deportation proceedings brought after
 the effective dates of those statutes. In 2001, the United
 States Supreme Court decided this issue in St. Cyr and held that
 the AEDPA and the IIRIRA could not be retroactively applied to
 preclude Section 212(c) relief to an alien who pleaded guilty to
 an aggravated felony at a time when a Section 212(c) waiver was
 available to the alien. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. at 317-26. The Court
 
reasoned that aliens pleading guilty to aggravated felonies prior
 to the AEDPA and the IIRIRA likely gave up their trial rights
 with the expectation that they could seek a Section 212(c)
 waiver, and therefore precluding any possibility of Section
 212(c) relief by applying the AEDPA and IIRIRA retroactively to
 such aliens would be improper. Id. at 321-26. 
It is the Supreme Court's 2001 decision in St. Cyr that
 
spawned the distinction between aliens who pleaded guilty and
 those who were convicted after trial with respect to eligibility
 for Section 212(c) waivers. In the wake of St. Cyr, the federal
 circuit courts of appeal have split over whether the ADEPA and
 the IIRIRA can be retroactively applied to aliens who were
 convicted after trial. See Kellerman v. Holder, 592 F.3d 700,
 
705-06 (6th Cir. 2010). The majority of circuits, including the
 Ninth Circuit, have held that the AEDPA and the IIRIRA can be
 retroactively applied to aliens who were convicted after trial
 because, unlike aliens who pleaded guilty, aliens who were
 convicted after trial did not abandon any rights in reliance on
 the aliens' continued eligibility for the Section 212(c) waiver.
 See id.; Armendariz–Montoya v. Sonchik, 291 F.3d 1116, 1121 (9th
 Cir. 2002).
 
Here, Nagao received advice from his trial counsel and
 
went to trial in 1995. This was not only before the AEDPA and
 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
the IIRIRA were enacted, but before the St. Cyr's retroactivity
 
analysis made the distinction between pleading guilty and being
 convicted after trial relevant to eligibility for waivers under
 Section 212(c). At the time Nagao went to trial, there was no
 distinction between pleading guilty and being convicted after
 trial for purposes of eligibility for a Section 212(c) waiver. 
See Brooks, 283 F.3d at 1273. Accordingly, Nagao's trial counsel
 did not exhibit a lack of skill, judgment, or diligence in
 failing to distinguish between the deportation consequences of
 Nagao pleading guilty and being convicted after trial. Nagao has
 not shown that when trial counsel was advising Nagao in 1995,
 trial counsel could reasonably have predicted that the AEDPA and
 the IIRIRA would subsequently be enacted and that the 2001 St.
 Cyr decision would attach different deportation consequences (in
 some federal circuits) to pleading guilty and to being convicted
 after trial.

(b) Nagao cannot show that any alleged errors of his
 
trial counsel resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial
 impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. Nagao does not
 claim that he has a potentially meritorious defense to the
 charges of which he was convicted in this case. Indeed, his only
 claim is that due to the ineffective assistance of his trial
 counsel, he was convicted by jury verdicts rather than by guilty
 pleas. Nagao cites no authority to support the contention that
 
3 Trial counsel's advice that Nagao could only avoid
deportation by obtaining an acquittal was technically incorrect
because Section 212(c) waivers were available in 1995. However,
at that time, a Section 212(c) waiver was available regardless of
whether Nagao pleaded guilty or was convicted after trial. Thus,
if Nagao's major concern was to avoid deportation, it was not
objectively unreasonable or ineffective for trial counsel to
advise Nagao to proceed to trial.
 See Briones v. State,  74 Haw.
442, 462, 848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993). When trial counsel rendered
 the advice, securing an acquittal was the only way for Nagao to
avoid being subject to deportation, and he could still seek a
Section 212(c) waiver if he was convicted after trial. Thus, it
appears that going to trial gave Nagao the best chance of
avoiding deportation. 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
he suffered the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a
 
potentially meritorious defense under the circumstances of this
 case. The illogic of Nagao's argument is highlighted by the
 relief he requested in his Petition. Although he argues that his
 trial counsel's deficient advice deprived him of the opportunity
 to plead guilty to the charges (Counts II and III), the remedy he
 seeks is to have this court set aside his judgment of conviction
 on these charges and reset the case for a trial on the merits. 
(3) Nagao's reliance on Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S.
 
Ct. 1473 (2010) is misplaced. In a post-conviction proceeding,
 Padilla sought to invalidate his guilty plea to drug charges
 based the erroneous advice he received from counsel regarding the
 deportation consequences of his plea. Id. at 1478. The United
 
States Supreme Court held that before a non-citizen criminal
 defendant enters a guilty plea, defense counsel has a duty under
 the Sixth Amendment to inform the defendant whether the plea
 carries a risk of deportation. Id. at 1486. The Court concluded
 
that because the law was clear that Padilla would be subject to
 "presumptively mandatory" deportation if convicted of the drug
 charges, Padilla's claim that counsel advised Padilla that he did
 not have to worry about deportation in pleading guilty, if true,
 was sufficient to show that counsel's representation fell below
 an objective standard of reasonableness. Id. at 1478, 1482-84. 
The Court remanded the case for further proceedings to determine
 whether Padilla could demonstrate his entitlement to relief by
 showing that he was prejudiced by his counsel's alleged
 objectively unreasonable representation. Id. at 1483-87. 
Nagao cites Padilla to support his claim that his trial
 
counsel provided ineffective assistance. However, Padilla is
 distinguishable. Padilla involved a situation in which a 
criminal defendant claimed that he was induced to plead guilty as
 the result of counsel's failure to properly advise him of the
 adverse deportation consequences of pleading guilty. Here, Nagao
 does not claim that he was induced to plead guilty as a result of
 trial counsel's failure to properly advise him of the deportation
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
consequences of pleading guilty. Moreover, for the reasons
 
previously discussed, Nagao cannot show that his trial counsel's
 representation was objectively unreasonable or that it resulted
 in the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially
 meritorious defense.
 
III.
 
We conclude that Nagao's Petition did not raise a
 
colorable claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The
 Order Denying Petition is affirmed.
