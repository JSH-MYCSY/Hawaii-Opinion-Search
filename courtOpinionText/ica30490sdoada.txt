PATRICIA MAHI, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
THE VARIABLE ANNUITY LIFE INSURANCE 
COMPANY, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
KONA DIVISION
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-187K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Patricia Mahi ("Mahi") appeals from
 
the Order Granting Defendant The Variable Annuity Life Insurance
 
Company's Motion for Summary Judgment, filed on December 7, 2009,
 and the Final Judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee The
 Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company ("VALIC"), filed on
 April 28, 2010, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit.
1
 Mahi and her then-husband, Dennis E. Arms ("Arms"),
 
entered into an Agreement Incident to and in Contemplation of
 Divorce ("AICD"), filed August 10, 1998, in anticipation of their
 divorce which was finalized on December 17, 1998. This appeal
 centers around the interaction between the AICD and Hawaii
 Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 560:2-804(b) and the effect the
 statute has on Arms's tax-sheltered annuity 403(b) account
 ("VALIC Account").

 The Honorable Ronald Ibarra presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
On appeal, Mahi argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
granting VALIC's motion for summary judgment ("MSJ") because (1)
 
an express term in the AICD precluded application of HRS § 560:2­804(b), which the Circuit Court applied to revoke Mahi's rights
 as a beneficiary of the VALIC Account; and (2) Mahi presented
 proof that she and Arms did not have an adversarial relationship
 and that they had used Mahi's inheritance during their marriage,
 creating a dispute of material fact. Additionally, Mahi argues
 that the Circuit Court erred (3) by applying HRS § 560:2-804(b)
 retroactively. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Mahi's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Section 2-804 of the 1993 Uniform Probate Code 
("UPC") was adopted by the Hawai' i Legislature in 1996 and 
codified, in whole, as HRS § 560:2-804. Generally, enactment of section 2-804 of the UPC "reflects a legislative judgment that when the insured leaves unaltered a will, trust, or insurance-beneficiary designation in favor of an ex-spouse, the insured's failure to designate substitute takers more likely than not represents inattention rather than intention." Lawrence W. Waggoner, Spousal Rights in our Multiple-Marriage Society: The Revised Uniform Probate Code, 26 Real Prop. Prob. & Tr. J. 683, 699–700 (1992) (commenting on a substantially similar Oklahoma statute). 
HRS § 560:2-804(b) adopts the aforementioned principle
 
as a rebuttable presumption, stating, in pertinent part:
 
(b) Revocation upon divorce or termination. Except as
provided by the express terms of a governing instrument, a
court order, or a contract relating to the division of the
estate made between the divorced individuals before or after
 the marriage, divorce, annulment, between two former
reciprocal beneficiaries before the termination of a
reciprocal beneficiary relationship, the divorce or
annulment of a marriage or the termination of a reciprocal
beneficiary relationship:
 
(1)	 Revokes any revocable:
 
(A)	 Disposition or appointment of property
made by a divorced individual or a former
reciprocal beneficiary to the individual's
 
2
    NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
former spouse or reciprocal beneficiary in
a governing instrument and any disposition
or appointment created by law or in a
governing instrument to a relative of the
divorced individual's former spouse or
reciprocal beneficiary[.]
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 560:2-804(b) (2006).  Here, it is undisputed that
 
the VALIC Account is a "governing instrument" and that a payment
 
to a beneficiary under the VALIC Account is a "revocable
 disposition or appointment of property" under the statute.
 
Mahi argues that Paragraph 8.B of the AICD contains an
 
express term contradicting Arms's presumptive intent to revoke
 Mahi's beneficiary status under the VALIC Account. 
Specifically, Paragraph 8.B states: "Each party agrees to
 maintain his or her own individual and/or group insurance policy
 with unrestrained freedom to designate the beneficiaries as each
 so personally desires." Mahi's argument before the trial court
 and on appeal, however, presupposes that the VALIC Account is an
 "insurance policy" such that it would be covered by Paragraph
 8.B. The AICD, however, identifies the VALIC Account as Arms's
 
"Hawaii Teacher's Retirement" in Paragraph 6.A, which itself
 disposes of his "pension or retirement," thus making it plain
 that the VALIC Account was a retirement account, not an insurance
 policy, and that Paragraph 8.B would not have addressed it.
 
It is undisputed that the VALIC Account is "a tax-
sheltered annuity 403(b) account." Section 403(b) of the
 Internal Revenue Code relates to the taxability of beneficiaries
 of "annuity contracts" purchased by a § 501(c)(3) employer or a
 public school. 26 U.S.C. § 403(b) (1994 & Supp. III 1998); see
 also § 501(c)(3). "[A]n annuity contract is generally a contract
 issued by an insurance company that is considered to be an
 annuity contract in accordance with the customary practice of
 life insurance companies." Gordon O. Pehrson et al., Tax
 Management: Annuities, Life Insurance, and Long-Term Care
 Insurance Products A-3 (2000) (internal quotation marks and
 original brackets omitted). That is, "an annuity contract should
 provide for a series of payments, to be made for a fixed period
 of greater than one year or over an individual's lifetime, so
 that there is a systematic liquidation of the consideration
 
3

previously paid for the contract and the earnings thereon." Id.
 
Although annuities are frequently sold by insurance
 
companies, "the sale of a product by an insurance company does
 
not inevitably render the product insurance." NationsBank of
 
N.C., N.A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 261
 (1995). Indeed, "[a]nnuities are not ordinarily considered to be
 'insurance.'" 1 Couch on Insurance § 1:22, at 50 (3d ed. 2009). 
"An annuity contract differs materially from an ordinary life
 insurance contract in that it is payable during the life of the
 annuitant rather than upon any future contingency . . . ." Id.
 
"Life insurance is a promise to pay a sum certain on the death of
 an insured, while an annuity is essentially a form of investment
 which pays periodically, during the life of the annuitant or
 during a term fixed by contract, rather than on the occurrence of
 a future contingency, such as death." 3B C.J.S. Annuities § 7
 (2003).
 
Here, it is undisputed that Arms executed an Employment
 
Agreement to Implement Purchase of a Tax-Sheltered Annuity, which
 indicates that beginning May 1995, Arms's basic monthly
 compensation would be reduced by 20% each month. According to
 the undisputed terms of the VALIC Account, VALIC agreed to
 "allocate Purchase Payments (less any charges) to one or more
 Investment Options selected by the Participant." The "Annuity
 Period" — the "time during which VALIC makes annuity payments" —
 begins at "the Annuity Date, whereupon the Participant may begin
 to receive payments. A participant could choose to "surrender
 the Participant Account before the Annuity Date for a cash
 payment equal to the Surrender Value" or to "withdraw a portion
 of the Accumulation Value in cash at any time before the Annuity
 Date." A beneficiary under the VALIC Account is simply the
 person or entity designated "to receive any benefits payable upon
 the Participant's death." 
An examination of the terms leads to the conclusion
 
that the VALIC Account is an investment vehicle, not an insurance

policy.2 Because Paragraph 8.B of the AICD only speaks about
 
insurance policies and the VALIC Account is not an insurance
 
policy, Mahi's argument that Paragraph 8.B contains an express
 term contradicting Arms's presumptive intent to revoke Mahi's
 beneficiary status under the VALIC Account is without merit.
 
(2) Mahi's second point of error is that the Circuit
 
Court erred in granting VALIC's MSJ because Mahi presented "proof
 of the parties' non-adversarial relationship[] and the prior
 us[e] of [Mahi's] inheritance," creating a presumption that, or a
 genuine issue of material fact as to whether, Arms intended to
 keep Mahi as the beneficiary under the VALIC Account. The proof
 Mahi refers to is apparently her declaration attached to her
 motion for partial summary judgment ("MPSJ"). Mahi's arguments
 in support of her point of error are that (a) HRS § 560:2-804
 "simply creates a rebuttable presumption against the existing
 beneficiary designation[,]" (b) marital partnership principles
 support Mahi's contention that Arms wished to keep Mahi as a
 beneficiary, and (c) the court should take into account the
 equitable considerations addressed in Mahi's declaration. 
(a) Mahi's argument rests on the idea that
 
presumptive revocation under HRS § 560:2-804(b) can be rebutted
 by extrinsic evidence of Arms's contrary intent. HRS § 560:2-804
 is, indeed, a rule of construction, see, e.g., Stillman v.
 Teachers Ins. & Annuity Ass'n Coll. Ret. Equities Fund, 343 F.3d
 1311, 1316–17 (10th Cir. 2003), which "applies to instruments
 executed before the [rule's] effective date unless there is a
 clear indication of a contrary intent." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 560:8­
201(b)(5) (2006). However, "where general provisions, terms or
 
2
 Mahi had argued that HRS § 431:1-204 defines the "transacting of
life insurance" to include "the granting of annuities." However, as the U.S.
Supreme Court stated in NationsBank of N.C., "[t]reatment of annuities under
state law . . . is contextual." 513 U.S. at 261. While states "generallyclassify annuities as insurance when defining the powers of insurancecompanies and state insurance regulators," states have "resisted lump
classification of annuities as insurance." Id.; cf. 1 Couch on Insurance §
1:22, at 50-51 (while annuities are not considered to be insurance, "statutes
may classify annuity contracts as insurance contracts for purpose of taxingthe company that sells them"). The Hawai' i Legislature, in defining "the
transacting of life insurance" to include "the granting of annuities,"appeared focused on the regulatory jurisdiction of the state and was notsaying that life insurance and annuities are synonymous. 
5
     
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
expressions in one part of a statute are inconsistent with more 
specific or particular provisions in another part, the particular provisions must govern or control." State v. Coney, 45 Haw. 650, 
662, 372 P.2d 348, 354 (1962), overruled in part on other grounds by City & Cnty. of Honolulu v. Bonded Inv. Co., 54 Haw. 414, 507 P.2d 1084 (1973). Furthermore, "the express inclusion of a provision in a statute implies the exclusion of another[] in interpreting statutes." Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng'g & Erection, 
Inc., 87 Hawai' i 37, 55, 951 P.2d 487 505 (1998). 
Here, HRS § 560:2-804(b) does not provide for the
 
presumption to be rebutted by extrinsic evidence of the
 decedent's intent, but rather, only by the express terms of a
 governing instrument, a court order, or a related contract. See
 
In re Estate of Spencer, 60 Haw. 497, 499–500, 591 P.2d 611, 613
 (1979) (holding that, under law then in effect, the testator's
 will is automatically revoked upon his marriage unless "provision
 is made in the will for such contingency"). As with the law in
 Spencer, HRS § 560:2-804(b) provides the exclusive method for
 countering the presumption of revocation, and extrinsic evidence
 of the decedent's intent is immaterial and irrelevant.
3 Thus,
 
the Circuit Court did not err in granting VALIC summary judgment.
 
(b) Mahi contends that she raised this argument in
 
her MPSJ or her opposition to VALIC's MSJ. Mahi contends that
 she "further objected" by filing a notice of appeal from the
 Final Judgment. As VALIC points out in its answering brief,
 however, while Mahi generally appealed to equitable principles in
 
3
 Even if the introduction of extrinsic evidence of intent were 
permitted, Mahi's Declaration does not contain a clear indication of contrary
intent sufficient to counter the statutory revocation of Mahi's beneficiary
status upon divorce. See HAW. REV. STAT. § 560:8-201(b)(5) (providing that a
rule of construction or presumption in the Hawai' i UPC applies to instruments
executed before the effective date "unless there is a clear indication of a 
contrary intent"). Mahi admits in her Declaration that Arms "didn't make anyspecific promises to [her] not to change the beneficiary designation after
[they] were divorced[.]" 
The mere fact that Arms did not take affirmative 
steps to remove Mahi as a beneficiary does not rebut the presumption of
revocation in HRS § 560:2-804(b). See In re Estate of Lamparella, 109 P.3d
959, 966 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2005) (the purpose of presumptive revocation "would
be eviscerated if a former spouse could circumvent the automatic revocationeffected by the statute by submitting self-serving testimony that the decedentspouse's inaction reflected an intention to revive his or her designation ofthe ex-spouse as the beneficiary"). 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
her MPSJ and her opposition to VALIC's MSJ, she never presented 
an argument relating to marital partnership principles. Furthermore, filing a notice of appeal does not raise a new legal argument. Thus, the point is waived. See Haw. Ventures, LLC v. 
Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai' i 438, 500, 164 P.3d 696, 758 (2007) ("As 
a general rule, if a party does not raise an argument at the circuit court level, that argument will be deemed to have been waived on appeal[.]" (quoting Kemp v. State of Haw. Child Support Enforcement Agency, 111 Hawai' i 367, 391, 141 P.3d 1014, 1038 
(2006) (internal quotation marks and original brackets omitted))). 
(c) Mahi argues that the Circuit Court should have
 
considered extrinsic evidence of Arms's intent because it would
 be inequitable not to consider it. The statutory presumption of
 revocation in HRS § 560:2-804(b), however, can only be rebutted
 by an express term in one of the applicable legal documents. A
 court cannot rewrite the AICD based on equitable principles. See
 
Terwilliger v. Terwilliger, 206 F.3d 240, 245 (2d Cir. 2000) (a
 court cannot "redraft a contract to accord with its instinct for
 the dispensation of equity upon the facts of a given case"). 
Furthermore, the factual assertions in Mahi's Declaration do not
 raise a dispute of material fact as to Arms's intent. Thus, the
 argument is without merit.
 
(3) Mahi argues that the VALIC Account is not a
 
governing instrument because (a) applying HRS § 560:2-804(b) in
 this case "violates the contracts clauses under the Hawaii and
 United States Constitutions," (b) HRS § 560:2-804(b) cannot apply
 retroactively, and (c) insurance policies are governed by the
 statutes in force when the policies are written. 
(a) Application of HRS § 560:2-804(b) to Arms's 
beneficiary designation violates neither the Hawai' i nor the 
United States Constitutions.
4 Mahi argues that the application 
of HRS § 560:2-804 "so as to revoke Mr. Arms' designation of the Plaintiff as the beneficiary of the 1995 annuity" violates the 
4
 Contrary to Mahi's contention, and as observed by the Attorney
General of the State of Hawai' i ("Attorney General"), there is no Contracts
Clause in the Hawai' i Constitution. 
7
    
  
    
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Contracts Clause. Mahi essentially argues that HRS § 560:2-804
 
impaired Arms's contractual right under the terms of the VALIC
 Account to select a beneficiary, although neither VALIC nor
 Arms's estate asserts the claim.
 
Even if Mahi could assert Arms's claim in this fashion, 
Freitas v. Admin. Dir. of Courts, 104 Hawai' i 483, 485, 92 P.3d 
993, 995 (2004), the argument fails. Arms's contractual rights under the terms of the VALIC Account were not impaired. HRS § 560:2-804(b) affects donative transfers, not contractual rights. See Stillman, 343 F.3d 1311, 1322. Therefore, the 
application of HRS § 560:2-804(b) in this case is not unconstitutional under the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution. 
(b) Any statute-based presumption against the
 
retroactive application of statutes is overcome in this case by
 the express provision in HRS § 560:8-201(b)(5) ("Any rule of
 construction or presumption provided in this Act applies to
 instruments executed before the effective date unless there is a
 clear indication of a contrary intent.").
5
 
(c) As noted above, the VALIC Account is an
 
annuity, not an insurance policy. Furthermore, the law affecting
 the beneficiary designation in the VALIC Account was that which
 was in effect when the beneficiary rights vested upon Arms's
 death.
6 Chang, 42 Haw. at 536–37. Thus, Mahi's argument is
 
without merit.
 
5
 In addition, as noted by both VALIC and the Attorney General,
there was in fact no retroactive application of HRS § 560:2-804. "[A] statute
does not operate retroactively merely because it relates to antecedent events,
or because part of the requisites of its action is drawn from time antecedent
to its passing, but is retroactive only when it is applied to rights acquired
prior to its enactment." Emp's Ret. Sys. of the Territory of Hawaii v. Chang,
42 Haw. 532, 536 (Haw. Terr. 1958) (citing 2 Story, Constitution, § 1398; 82
C.J.S. Statutes § 412)). Rights in a decedent's estate arise at the time of
death and not before. Id. at 536–37.
 
6
 Mahi's citation to HRS § 560:8-101(7) is inapposite. The statute 
actually states: "Section 560:7-501 applies to governing instruments executed
on or after June 24, 2005." H AW. REV. STAT. § 560:8-101(7) (emphasis added). 
HRS § 560:7-501 relates to trusts for domestic or pet animals. H AW. REV. STAT. 
§ 560:7-501. The relevant statute is actually HRS § 560:8-201, which relatesto the 1996 amendments to the Hawai' i UPC; subsection (b)(1) states that on
January 1, 1997, "[t]he amendments made by this Act apply to any governinginstruments executed by decedents dying thereafter[.]" H
AW. REV. STAT. § 560:8­
201(a), (b)(1). For this reason as well, Mahi's argument is without merit.
