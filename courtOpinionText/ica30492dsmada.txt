NO. 30492
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
In the Matter of ALOHA ISLAND ENTERPRISES LLC,
Notice of Failure to Comply with Hawaii Revised
Statutes and Commission’s Regulations; Order to
Show Cause Why Respondent’s Operating Authority
Should Not Be Suspended or Revoked
 
APPEAL FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

 
(DOCKET NO. 2009-0198)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL

 
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over Appellant Aloha Island Enterprises, LLC's
 
(Appellant Aloha Island Enterprises), appeal from the following
 two orders that Appellee State of Hawai
'i Public Utilities 
1
Commission's (Appellee PUC)  entered:
(1)	 a February 11, 2010 order revoking Appellant Aloha
Island Enterprises' certificate of public convenience
and necessity (the February 11, 2010 revocation
order), and
 
(2)	 an April 8, 2010 order dismissing Appellant Aloha
Island Enterprises' February 24, 2010 motion for
reconsideration of the February 11, 2010 revocation
order and denying Appellant Aloha Island Enterprises'
February 24, 2010 motion to enlarge the time period
for filing a notice of appeal.
 
As explained below, Appellant Aloha Island Enterprises did not
 
perfect its right to appeal pursuant to Hawai 'i Revised Statutes 
(HRS) § 271-32 (2007) and HRS § 271-33 (2007).
 
Administrative appeals commence in a circuit court
 
"[e]xcept as otherwise provided[.]" HRS § 91-14(b) (1993 & Supp.

 In this matter, the Appellee Hawai' i Public Utilities Commission 
is comprised of Chairman Carlito P. Caliboso, Commissioner John E. Cole, and
Commissioner Leslie H. Kondo. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
2009). With respect to appeals from Appellee PUC's orders, the
 
Hawai'i legislature has provided otherwise: 
HRS Chapter 271, the Motor Carrier Law, regulates the
commercial transportation of people and property. The PUC
 
administers HRS Chapter 271; HRS Chapter 269 governs the PUC
and also applies to the administration of HRS Chapter 271
where not inconsistent. HRS § 271-2 (1993).
 
Within HRS Chapter 271, there are two relevant
statutory provisions governing appeals: HRS § 271-32(e)
(1993) and HRS § 271-33 (1993).
 
In re Robert's Tours & Transportation, Inc., 104 Hawai 'i 98, 102, 
85 P.3d 623, 627 (2004). "[B]oth HRS §§ 271-32(e) and -33 allow
 
a party to appeal from a final PUC order, provided that the party
 has filed (and the PUC has denied) a motion for reconsideration
 of the PUC's order[.]" Id. at 104, 85 P.3d at 629. HRS § 271­
32(e) provides:
 
(e) An appeal shall lie, subject to chapter 602, from
every order made by the commission that is final, or if
preliminary, is of the nature defined by section 91-14(a),
in the manner provided for civil appeals from the circuit
court; provided the order is made after reconsideration or
rehearing or is the subject of a motion for reconsideration
or rehearing, which the commission has denied. An appeal
shall lie, subject to chapter 602, in the manner provided
for civil appeals from the circuit courts, only by a person
aggrieved in the contested case hearing provided for in this
section.
 
HRS § 271-32(e) (emphases added). Furthermore, HRS § 271-32(b)
 
provides a ten-day time limit for filing the mandatory motion for
 reconsideration:
 
(b) The motion for reconsideration or a rehearing
shall be filed within ten days after the decision and order
has been served and shall set forth specifically the ground
or grounds on which the applicant considers the decision or
order to be unlawful. No person shall in any court urge or
rely on any ground not so set forth in the motion.
 
HRS § 271-32(b) (emphasis added). HRS § 271-33
provides in relevant part:
 
From the order made on an application for
reconsideration or rehearing by the public utilities
commission under this chapter, an appeal shall lie, subject
to chapter 602, in the manner and within the time provided
for civil appeals from the circuit courts and by the rule of
court; provided the order is final, or if preliminary is of
the nature defined by section 91-14(a).

HRS § 271-33 (emphases added). Therefore, "under HRS § 271­
32(e) . . . and HRS § 271-33 . . . , the aggrieved party may appeal from a PUC order only after the party has moved for, and the PUC has denied, reconsideration of the order." In re 
Brandon, 113 Hawai
'i 154, 156, 149 P.3d 806, 808 (App. 2006) 
(dismissing an appeal for lack of jurisdiction when an appellant failed to file, and obtain an adjudication of, a motion for reconsideration of a PUC order). Furthermore, because HRS § 271­32(b) provides that "[n]o person shall in any court urge or rely on any ground not so set forth in the motion [for reconsideration][,]" the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has recognized 
that "appellants cannot raise . . . errors on appeal to this court . . . [that] were not specifically set forth in their petition for reconsideration to the [Public Utilities] Commission as required by HRS § 271-32(b)." Application of Charley's Tour 
and Transp., 55 Haw. 463, 467, 522 P.2d 1272, 1276 (1974) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, a timely motion for reconsideration is necessary to both (a) perfect a party's right to assert an appeal from a PUC order and (b) formally raise the issues that the party wants an appellate court to review. 
The timing of the mandatory motion for reconsideration 
is a jurisdictional issue. "The motion for reconsideration or a rehearing shall be filed within ten days after the decision and order has been served[.]" HRS § 271-32(b) (emphasis added); see also Hawai
'i Administrative Rules (HAR) § 6-61-137 (2010) ("The 
motion shall be filed within ten days after the decision or order is served upon the party[.]"). Service of an order by Appellee 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
PUC upon an aggrieved party is effective on the date when "[t]he 
document is properly stamped, addressed, and mailed to the last known address of the party on file with the commission or to its attorney." HAR § 6-61-21(d)(3) (2010). Furthermore, when Appellee PUC serves an order by mail, "two days shall be added to the prescribed period." HAR § 6-61-21(e). In the instant case, Appellee PUC served the February 11, 2010 revocation order on Appellant Aloha Island Enterprises by mail on February 11, 2010. Therefore, the last day when Appellant Aloha Island Enterprises could file a motion for reconsideration was twelve days later, on Tuesday, February 23, 2010. HRS § 271-32(b); HAR § 6-61-21(e); HAR § 6-61-137. However, Appellant Aloha Island Enterprises filed its February 24, 2010 motion for reconsideration one day late, on Wednesday, February 24, 2010. Therefore, Appellant Aloha Island Enterprises' February 24, 2010 motion for reconsideration was untimely under HRS § 271-32(b), HAR § 6-61­21(e), and HAR § 6-61-137, and Appellee Aloha Island Enterprises failed to perfect its right to assert an appeal. Although Appellee Aloha Island Enterprises also moved Appellee PUC to enlarge the ten-day time limit for its motion for reconsideration pursuant to HAR § 6-6-23(a)(2) (2010), Appellee PUC denied the motion to enlarge time based on Appellee PUC's finding that Appellee Aloha Island Enterprises did not show "excusable neglect," as HAR § 6-6-23(a)(2) requires for enlargement of time. Furthermore, Appellee PUC "may not extend the time for taking any action on jurisdictional matters[.]" HAR § 6-6­23(a)(2). With respect to the jurisdictional issue of timeliness 
-4­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
in civil appeals, the Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has consistently 
"held that this type of jurisdictional defect can neither be 
waived by the parties nor disregarded by the court in the exercise of judicial discretion." Ass’n of Apartment Owners of 
Governor Cleghorn v. M.F.D., Inc., 60 Haw. 65, 70, 587 P.2d 301, 304 (1978). 
Based on the untimeliness of Appellee Aloha Island
 
Enterprises's February 24, 2010 motion for reconsideration of the
 February 11, 2010 revocation order, neither the February 11, 2010
 revocation order nor the April 8, 2010 order dismissing Appellant
 Aloha Island Enterprises' February 24, 2010 motion for
 reconsideration is an appealable order under HRS § 271-32(e) and
 HRS § 271-33. Absent an appealable order, we lack jurisdiction
 over Appeal No. 30492. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is
 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
