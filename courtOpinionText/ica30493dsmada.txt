IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
ISLAND INSURANCE COMPANY, LTD., Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v.
 
BLOCKBUSTER, INC., Defendant-Appellant,
 
and
 
JOHN DOES 1-100, JANE DOES 1-100,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2590)
 
ORDER GRANTING AUGUST 9, 2010 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL

(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiff-Appellee Island Insurance

 
Company, Ltd.'s (Appellee Island Insurance Company) August 9,
 
2010 motion to dismiss appellate court case number 30493 for lack
 of jurisdiction (“Motion to dismiss”), (2) Defendant-Appellant
 Blockbuster, Inc.'s (Appellant Blockbuster), August 16, 2010
 memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss and (3) the
 record, it appears that we lack jurisdiction over Appellant
 Blockbuster's interlocutory appeal from the Honorable Glenn J.
 Kim's two April 9, 2010 interlocutory summary judgment orders,
 because (a) the requirements for a timely interlocutory appeal
 were not met; and (b) the Honorable Glenn J. Kim's May 21, 2010
 order granting Appellant Blockbuster leave to file an
 interlocutory appeal from the two April 9, 2010 interlocutory
 summary judgment orders does not contain the conclusion and
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
findings that are necessary under Hawai 'i Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2009) for the certification of an 
interlocutory appeal. 
"When a civil appeal is permitted by law, the notice of
 
appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment
 or appealable order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). HRS § 641-1(b) is the
 law that permits interlocutory appeals from civil cases to the
 intermediate court of appeals:
 
(b) Upon application made within the time provided by
the rules of court, an appeal in a civil matter may be
allowed by a circuit court in its discretion from an order
denying a motion to dismiss or from any interlocutory
judgment, order, or decree whenever the circuit court may
think the same advisable for the speedy termination of
litigation before it. The refusal of the circuit court to
 allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or
decree shall not be reviewable by any other court.
 
HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2009) (emphases added). The Supreme
 
Court of Hawai 'i has explained its interpretation of HRAP 
Rule 4(a)(1) as follows:
 
We have interpreted HRAP Rule 4(a)(1)'s requirement that the
notice of interlocutory appeal be filed "within 30 days
after the date of entry of the . . . . order appealed from"
to mean that . . . [i]t is necessary for a party wanting to
 take an interlocutory appeal to move for an order allowing
the appeal, for the court to enter the order and for the
appellant to file the notice of appeal all within 30 days
from the filing of the order appealed from, unless the time
for appeal is extended pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(5).
 
State v. Irvine, 88 Hawai 'i 404, 406, 967 P.2d 236, 238 (1998) 
(some emphasis added; citation and block quotation format 
omitted). "The order appealed from on an interlocutory appeal is not made final, for any purpose, by the allowance of the interlocutory appeal and the time period runs from the entry of the order, not from the allowance of the appeal." King v. 
Wholesale Produce Dealers Ass'n of Hawaii, 69 Haw. 334, 335, 741 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.2d 721, 722 (1987).1 Thus, for example, we have held that we 
did not have jurisdiction over an appeal from an interlocutory 
order pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b) when "the court did not enter its written order allowing an interlocutory appeal within thirty days of the entry of the order from which Plaintiffs wished to appeal, despite Plaintiffs' prompt motion for such an order." Kohala Agriculture, 86 Hawai
'i at 311, 949 P.2d at 151. 
"Therefore, we conclude[d] that Plaintiffs' appeal of the [interlocutory] order was untimely and we [we]re without jurisdiction of that appeal." Id. 
In the instant case, Appellee Blockbuster filed its
 
May 6, 2010 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of
 the two April 9, 2010 interlocutory summary judgment orders, but
 the circuit court did not enter its May 21, 2010 order allowing
 an interlocutory appeal under HRS § 641-1(b) within thirty days
 after entry of the two April 9, 2010 interlocutory summary
 judgment orders, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) and HRS § 641-1(b) require
 under Irvine and King. Therefore, the requirements for a timely
 interlocutory appeal were not met.
 
Even if Appellant Blockbuster's appeal were timely, we
 
would lack jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal because
 the May 21, 2010 order that purports to allow Appellant
 Blockbuster to file an interlocutory appeal from the two April 9,

 With respect to certification of a circuit court's adjudication of
one or more but less than all claims for an appeal pursuant to HRCP Rule
54(b), the Supreme Court of Hawai' i has stated that Jenkins v. Cades Schutte 
Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), overruled King.
Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii Ins. Co., 77 Hawai' i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239
(1994). However, the holding in Jenkins "does not appear to disturb theholding in King with respect to HRS § 641-1(b)." Kohala Agriculture v.
Deloitte & Touche, 86 Hawai' i 301, 311 n.19, 949 P.2d 141, 151 n.19 (App.
1997).

2010 interlocutory summary judgment orders does not contain an 
express conclusion that an interlocutory appeal is advisable for the speedy termination of this litigation, and the reasons in support of that conclusion. In determining whether an interlocutory appeal is advisable for the speedy termination of the litigation before it, the circuit court's discretion is not unfettered. Lui v. City and County of Honolulu, 63 Haw. 668, 
672, 634 P.2d 595, 598 (1981). Therefore, when the circuit court concludes that an interlocutory appeal is advisable for the speedy termination of the litigation before it, then the circuit court must "set forth, in the order allowing the appeal, its reasons for that conclusion." Mason v. Water Resources 
International, 67 Haw. 510, 512, 694 P.2d 388, 389 (1985). Consequently, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has dismissed an 
interlocutory appeal when a circuit court has purported to "allow an interlocutory appeal without expressing any determination on the matter."
2 The May 21, 2010 order allowing an interlocutory 
appeal does not include an express conclusion that an interlocutory appeal is advisable for the speedy termination of the litigation before it, nor does the May 21, 2010 order include the circuit court's supporting reasons for that conclusion, as required under the holding in Mason. Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal from the two April 9,

 Blockbuster incorrectly relies on McCabe v. Berdon, 67 Haw. 178,
 
681 P.2d 571 (1984) to assert that we may look to the record -- beyond the
May 21, 2010 order -- for the lower court’s determination that interlocutory
appeal is advisable for the speedy termination of the litigation. McCabe was
 
decided prior to Mason. In Mason, the Hawaii Supreme Court set out the
“guidelines for bench and bar which are to be followed from now on.” 67 Haw.
 at 511, 684 P.2d at 388. The Mason guidelines require that the lower court’s
determination be set forth in the order allowing the appeal.
