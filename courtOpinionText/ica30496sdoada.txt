IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
TRACY K.T. OTANI, Claimant-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY,
Employer-Appellee, Self-Insured
 
APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS APPEALS BOARD
 
(AB 2007-279(H) (1-01-10146))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In this workers' compensation case, Claimant-Appellant 
Tracy Otani (Otani) appeals from the Decision and Order (D&O) in 
Case No. AB 2007-279(H) (1-01-10146) filed on April 8, 2010 by 
the State of Hawai' i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board 
(LIRAB). In the D&O, LIRAB affirmed the May 31, 2007 Decision (Decision) of the Director of Labor and Industrial Relations 
(Director) (Director's Decision). The Director found, inter 
alia, that (1) Employer State of Hawai' i Department of Public 
Safety (the State) was not liable for Otani's alleged psychological injury and (2) Otani was not entitled to additional 
temporary total disability (TTD) benefits. The Director's 
Decision was entered pursuant to a Stipulation and Settlement 
Agreement and Order (Agreement and Order) approved and ordered by 
the Director on January 12, 2006. 
On appeal, Otani contends LIRAB erred when it (1)
 
applied Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386-82 (1993) to deny
 
Otani's April 5, 2007 claim for a psychological injury and (2)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
misapplied HRS § 386-89(c) (1993) to deny Otani's request for TTD
 
benefits.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Otani's
 
points of error as follows:
 
LIRAB did not err when it affirmed the Director's
 
Decision to deny Otani's request to reopen the 2001 injury case
 
for additional TTD benefits. Otani contends he is entitled to
 
additional TTD benefits for a recurrence of his injury on June
 
14, 2005 when he stepped in a hole and "aggravated" his back. 
Otani states he sought treatment from Ernest Bade, M.D. 
(Dr. Bade) on June 20, 2005 for that injury. Otani contends that
 
Dr. Bade's Certificates of Illness or Injury (Certificates)
 
covering the periods of June 20-August 9, 2005; August 15-October
 
14, 2005; and October 17, 2005-February 15, 2006, were for "work
 
activity aggravating [Otani's] lower back." Otani fails to
 
provide any additional documentation as to the extent of any
 
illness or injury for which any of the Certificates were
 
submitted.
 
Because the question before LIRAB was "[w]hether the 
Director erred in denying [Otani's] request for reopening for 
additional [TTD] benefits," we look to the standard for reopening 
a case. To reopen a workers' compensation case, HRS § 386-89(c) 
provides that the application must be "supported by a showing of 
substantial evidence, on the ground of a change in or of a 
mistake in a determination of fact related to the physical 
condition of the injured employee[.]" However, in light of the 
presumption under HRS § 386-85(1) (1993) that a claim is for a 
covered injury, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has stated that "[w]e 
do not believe that a showing of substantial evidence is necessary as a prerequisite to a review by the Director or 
[LIRAB] of an application under subparagraph (c) of HRS § 386­

89." De Victoria v. H and K Contractors, 56 Haw. 552, 556, 545
 
P.2d 692, 696 (1976). "Where . . . the primary issue is whether
 
or not an injury is related to a work accident, a claimant is
 
entitled to the same presumption on review of a case once closed
 
that his claim is for a covered injury as that in an original
 
hearing." De Victoria, 56 Haw. at 561, 545 P.2d at 699-700; see
 
Mitchell v. BWK Joint Venture, 57 Haw. 535, 546, 560 P.2d 1292,
 1299 (1977).
 
In Korsak v. Hawaii Permanente Med. Group, 94 Hawai' i 
297, 12 P.3d 1238 (2000), the Hawai' i Supreme Court specifically 
addressed the question of whether the statutory presumption in favor of the claimant "applies in the context of determining the 
compensability of subsequent injuries alleged to be work-related 
as a result of a primary compensable injury." Id. at 305, 12 
P.3d at 1246 (footnote omitted). The Hawai' i Supreme Court held 
that "in any proceeding on a claim for compensation due to an 
alleged compensable consequence of a work-related injury, HRS 
§ 386-85 creates a presumption in favor of the claimant that the 
subsequent injury is causally related to the primary injury." 
Id. at 307, 12 P.3d at 1248 (emphasis added). This presumption 
of compensability "imposes upon the employer the burden of going 
forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion." 
De Victoria, 56 Haw. at 561, 545 at 699 (citation omitted). 
Therefore, it was the State's burden to rebut the
 
presumption of compensability by substantial evidence that
 
Otani's condition was unchanged since the Agreement and Order.
 
Lorne Direnfeld, M.D. (Dr. Direnfeld), in his November 23, 2004
 
report, indicated that recurrent back pain could be expected,
 
based on Otani's "chronic lumbar strain associated with lumbar
 
spondylosis (age-related, genetically-influenced degenerative
 
disc and joint changes)." On March 7, 2005, the State provided
 
Dr. Bade with a copy of Dr. Direnfeld's November 23, 2004 report,
 
requesting he respond within 30 days if he disagreed with 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dr. Direnfeld's opinion; otherwise, the State would presume his
 
concurrence with the report. Dr. Bade did not respond.
 
On January 12, 2006, the Director approved and ordered
 
the Agreement and Order, which indicated Otani was 7% partially
 
permanently disabled (PPD). On May 3, 2006, an MRI scan of
 
Otani's lumbar spine was taken and compared with the results of
 
an MRI scan taken on June 22, 2004, showing that Otani's
 
condition was essentially unchanged during that time. 
Even presuming Otani's alleged incidents between June
 
and August 2005 caused a change in his physical condition, the
 
State successfully rebutted that presumption when it provided
 
objective data that Otani's condition was unchanged by his
 
alleged injuries. The MRI taken in 2004 before the alleged 2005
 
incidents and the MRI taken in 2006 after the alleged 2005
 
incidents revealed no change in Otani's condition.
 
Because we conclude that LIRAB did not err in denying
 
Otani's request on its merit, we need not address Otani's other
 
point of error that LIRAB did not address the issue of whether
 
the statute of limitations was tolled because of voluntary
 
payments by the employer.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Decision and Order in 
Case No. AB 2007-279(H) (1-01-10146) filed on April 8, 2010 by the State of Hawai' i Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board 
is affirmed.
