IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
–––O0O–––
 
ISIDRO OSWALDO CUN-LARA, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee 
NO. 30497
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(SPECIAL PROCEEDING - PRISONER NO. 09-1-0008;
CRIMINAL NO. 06-1-0145)
 
ORDER OF AMENDMENT
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the published Opinion of the
 
Court filed on March 28, 2012, is amended as follows:
 
In the last paragraph on page 20, the entire last
 
sentence beginning with the word "Therefore" and ending with the
 
word "diligence" is deleted and replaced with the following
 sentence: 
Therefore, Cun-Lara's claim that his no-contest plea was not
knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given due to a lack of
understanding of the deportation risks associated with pleading no
contest to the drug-paraphernalia charge is not colorable, and the
Circuit Court did not err in denying this claim without a hearing.
 
In the first paragraph on page 21, the first sentence, 
"It is the defendant's burden to establish ineffective assistance 
of counsel" and the citation, "Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i at 514, 78 
p.3d at 327" is deleted. In the following sentence that begins with the word "Nothing" the word "constitutional" is deleted, so that the sentence reads: 
Nothing in the record indicates that Attorney Castillo's
obligations extended any further than informing Cun-Lara that
deportation was a possible consequence of his no-contest plea.
 
The remaining two sentences of the paragraph, beginning with the
 
word "Nothing" and ending with the word "hearing" are deleted
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from page 21 and moved to the ending of the paragraph at the top
 
of page 24, after the sentence ending with the word "omitted" and
 replaces the last sentence, "Cun-Lara failed to meet his burden
 and thus his ineffective assistance of counsel claim is without
 merit," which is deleted.
 
In the first paragraph of section B on page 23, after
 
the words "voluntary manner" a period is inserted and the
 remainder of that sentence which reads, "and that Attorney
 Castillo's deportation-related advice was not constitutionally
 ineffective" is deleted. 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to take all
 
necessary steps to notify the publishing agency of the
 amendments.
 
An Amended Opinion of the Court will be filed
 
contemporaneously with this order. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, March 30, 2012.
