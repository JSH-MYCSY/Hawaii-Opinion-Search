OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JEFFERSON JOSEPH SCOTT, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 09-1-393K)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jefferson Joseph Scott ("Scott")
 
appeals from the April 14, 2010 Judgment of Conviction and
 
1
Sentence of the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit  ("Circuit
Court") convicting Scott of Assault in the Third Degree in

 Hawaii Revised Statutes
 violation of section 707-712(1)(a),
3
("HRS") (Count 1) ;  Terroristic Threatening in the Second Degree
4	 5
in violation of HRS §§ 707-715(1)  and 707-717(1)  (Count 2); and

 The Honorable Judge Ronald Ibarra presided.

 Assault in the third degree. (1) A person
commits the offense of assault in the third degree if
the person:
 
(a)	 Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly
causes bodily injury to another person[.]
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 707-712(1)(a) (1993).

 Scott was originally charged under Count 1 with Assault in the
Second Degree in violation of HRS 707-711(1)(a). Count 1 related to Scott
 having punched the Complaining Witness ("CW") and/or Scott's brother hitting
CW in the head with a gun (with Scott guilty as an accomplice). Count 3
 involved Scott kicking CW in the head while CW lay on the ground.
 
4
 Terroristic threatening, defined. A person
commits the offense of terroristic threatening if the
person threatens, by word or conduct, to cause bodily
injury to another person or serious damage to property
of another or to commit a felony:
    
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Assault in the Third Degree in violation of HRS § 707-712(1)(a)
 
(Count 3). Scott was sentenced to one year in prison for his
 conviction on Count 1, one year in prison for his conviction on
 Count 2, and one year in prison for his conviction on Count 3;
 with his sentence on Count 1 to run consecutively with his
 sentence on Count 3, and his sentence on Count 2 to run
 concurrently with his sentences on Counts 1 and 3. 
Scott raises four points of error on appeal relating to
 
his conviction on Count 1, contending that the Circuit Court
 erred by: (1) admitting Scott's confession; (2) admitting Scott's
 prior testimony from the restraining order hearing; (3) including
 an instruction on deadly force as part of its instruction on
 self-defense; and (4) sentencing Scott to consecutive terms
 without providing specific findings, and without considering a
 pre-sentence investigation report. Scott concedes guilt on and
 does not challenge Counts 2 or 3.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Scott's
 appeal as follows:
 
(1) Scott contends that his confession was improperly
 
admitted because both the written police advisement waiver form
 and his oral waiver during the interview were defective because
 he was not advised of the criminal offense for which he was being
 investigated. Scott did not raise the issue below; consequently,
 we examine for plain error.
 
(1)	 With the intent to terrorize, or in reckless
disregard of the risk of terrorizing, another
person[.]
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 707-715(1) (1993).

 Terroristic threatening in the second degree.
(1) A person commits the offense of terroristic
threatening in the second degree if the person commits
terroristic threatening other than as provided in
section 707-716.

AW. REV. STAT. § 707-717(1) (1993).

It is an established principle that:
 
[B]efore statements stemming from custodial interrogation may be
offered against a criminal defendant at trial, the State must
demonstrate that law enforcement officials gave certain warnings
and followed specific procedures effective to secure the privilege
against self-incrimination guaranteed by both the Fifth Amendment
of the United States Constitution and by article I, section 8 of
our State constitution.
 
State v. Ramones, 69 Haw. 398, 403-05, 744 P.2d 514, 516-18 
(1987) (quoting State v. Uganiza, 68 Haw. 28, 30, 702 P.2d 1352, 1354 (1985)). Furthermore, "a suspect's awareness of all the possible subjects of the police questioning is not relevant to determine whether the suspect voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his Miranda rights." Id. at 404, 744 P.2d 
at 517 (citing Colorado v. Spring, 479 U.S. 564, 574 (1987)) (defendant knowingly and intelligently waived Fifth Amendment privilege even though he had not been apprised of the specific charges against him because he understood his right to remain silent and that anything he said could be used against him as evidence); State v. Strong, 121 Hawai' i 513, 526-27, 221 P.3d 
491, 504-05 (App. 2009) (defendant knowingly and intelligently waived Fifth Amendment privilege even though police officer had intentionally failed to list all the potential charges against defendant on waiver of rights form). "The Constitution does not 
require that a criminal suspect know and understand every possible consequence of a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege." Ramones, 69 Haw. at 405, 744 P.2d at 518 (quoting 
Spring, 479 U.S. at 574). 
Detective Adams informed Scott of his right to remain
 
silent, his right to counsel, that any statement he made could be
 used against him, and that he had the right to have an attorney
 present during interrogation. Before any questions were asked,
 Scott was advised that Detective Adams worked in the criminal
 investigations unit, that he was investigating the altercation
 between Scott and his neighbor, and that Scott had the right to
 stop answering Detective Adams' questions at any time. 
Therefore, under Strong and Ramones, Scott was adequately advised
 of his right against self-incrimination and the Circuit Court did
 not plainly err in finding that Scott's October 20, 2009
 statement was voluntary and, therefore, in admitting the
 
3
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
confession into evidence.
 
(2) Scott contends that his testimony from the
 
February 9, 2010 protective order hearing was improperly admitted
 
because it was not offered voluntarily under HRS § 621-26.6 In
 
support, Scott argues that his counsel was incompetent for
 allowing him to testify at the protective order hearing when
 Scott's criminal case for the same incident was pending, and that
 his counsel had a conflict of interest because he also
 represented Scott's brother. There was no evidence that Scott's
 testimony at the protective order hearing was anything but
 voluntary. Scott's representation at the civil proceeding does
 not raise any ineffectiveness of counsel or conflict of interest
 in this case.
 
(3) Scott contends that the Circuit Court erred when
 
its self-defense instruction incorporated an instruction on
 deadly force, because deadly force was not supported by any
 evidence. Scott appears to argue that the self-defense
 instruction caused jurors to draw unwarranted attention to
 whether Scott was justified in using deadly force in response to
 threatened serious bodily injury, when, according to Scott, his
 actions did not constitute deadly force.
7 Including reference to
 
deadly force, according to Scott, confused the jury and
 contributed to Scott's conviction on Count 1.
 
It was not erroneous for the Circuit Court to include a
 
"deadly force" instruction in the self-defense jury instruction.
 A deadly force instruction is properly included in the self-
defense jury instruction when the defendant is charged with
 assault in the second degree. State v. Sua, No. 29500, 2010 WL
 
6 Confessions when admissible. No confession
 
shall be received in evidence unless it is first made
 
to appear to the judge before whom the case is being
tried that the confession was in fact voluntarily
made.
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 621-26 (1993).

 In court, Scott's counsel argued that "In my opinion, there is no
evidence on this record of self-defense by Kevin Scott as to that event." We
 presume that counsel mis-spoke and that he meant to say, as counsel later
stated in Scott's opening brief, that "there was no evidence of 'deadly force'
 
for the specific act (i.e. Scott's initial punch to CW) for which Scott
asserted self-defense and defense of others."

   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
1765670, at *7 (Haw. Ct. App. April 29, 2010) (deadly force 
instruction was properly included in self defense instruction when defendant was charged with second degree assault for punching, kicking, and stomping on CW). The amount of force used by Scott, and whether it amounted to deadly force, was a question of fact for the jury. See State v. Van Dyke, 101 Hawai' i 377, 
387, 69 P.3d 88, 98 (2003) (it was error for the court to fail to instruct jury on both force and deadly force because the amount of force used was a question of fact for the jury). 
Scott's contention that inclusion of the deadly force
 
instruction may have led the jury to erroneously apply deadly
 force in the context of the punch (Count 1) is without merit. 
The jury instructions with regard to the use of force in self-
protection followed the language of HRS § 703-304(1)-(2) in
 defining the use of "force" and "deadly force."
8 See Territory
 
v. Legaspi, 39 Haw. 660, 668 (Haw. Terr. 1953) ("An instruction
 given in the wording of the statute is sufficient."). The
 instructions also included all the necessary definitions for the
 jurors to decide whether to apply the use of force instruction or
 the use of deadly force instruction based upon the amount of
 force they found Scott to have used. Therefore, the Circuit
 Court's self-defense instruction was not erroneous.
 
(4) The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion by 
imposing consecutive sentences on Counts 1 and 3. State v. 
Sinagoga, 81 Hawai' i 421, 427-28, 918 P.2d 228, 234-35 (App. 
1996), overrruled in part on other grounds by State v. Veikoso, 102 Hawai' i 219, 74 P.3d 575 (2003). Scott did not raise this 
issue below; consequently, we review for plain error. 
8
 Use of force in self-protection. (1) Subject to
the provisions of this section and of section 703-308,
the use of force upon or toward another person is
justifiable when the actor believes that such force is
immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting
himself against the use of unlawful force by the other
person on the present occasion.
 
(2) The use of deadly force is justifiable under
this section if the actor believes that deadly force
is necessary to protect himself against death, serious
bodily injury, kidnapping, rape, or forcible sodomy.
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 703-304(1)-(2) (1993).

Contrary to Scott's argument, State v. Hussein, 122 
Hawai'i 495, 510, 229 P.3d 313, 328 (2010), is inapplicable here. 
State v. Wilson, No. 30284, 2010 WL 4409700 at *1 n.2 (Haw. Ct. 
App. November 3, 2010). Hussein's requirement that specific 
findings be entered before consecutive sentences can issue applies only to sentencing that occurs after the filing of the judgment on appeal. Id. Hussein was decided one week after 
sentencing in the instant case, and does not apply retroactively. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence filed on April 14, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the
 Third Circuit is affirmed.
