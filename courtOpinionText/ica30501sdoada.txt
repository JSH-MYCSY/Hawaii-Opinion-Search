 No written order denying this motion appears in either case file.
Shamblin, in his notice of appeal, maintained the motion was deemed denied
after 90 days from the filing of the motion, relying on Hawai' i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(3).  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
of his Writ of Habeas Corpus, filed on September 23, 2009, in the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court).2
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
 
Shamblin filed a Notice of Appeal on May 13, 2010 in 
Civil No. 09-1-2205.3 "When a civil appeal is permitted by law,
 
the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of
 the judgment or appealable order." HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The only
 
order that preceded Shamblin's Notice of Appeal by no more than
 
30 days was the Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration of Order
 
of Case Transfer, entered on April 20, 2010. Thus Shamblin's
 
notice of appeal as to all other orders was either untimely or
 
premature.
 
The Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration of Order
 
of Case Transfer is not a final appealable order. The Order of
 
Case Transfer, of which Shamblin was seeking reconsideration was
 
itself not a final order. HRS ยง 641-1 (1993 & Supp. 2010);
 
Familian Nw., Inc. v. Cent. Pac. Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw.
 
368, 369, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986) ("'Final order' means an order
 
ending the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be
 
accomplished.") (citation omitted); see also, In re Carefirst of
 
Md., Inc., 305 F.3d 253, 255 (4th Cir. 2002) ("[T]he transfer did
 
2 The Honorable Gary W.B. Chang issued the Order Denying Motion for
Reconsideration of Order of Case Transfer in Civil No 09-1-2205. The
 
Honorable Richard K. Perkins issued the Order Designating Motion as
Nonconforming Petition for Post-Conviction Relief and the Order Dismissing the
Petition for Post-Conviction Relief. The Order of Case Transfer was issued by
the Honorable Bert I. Ayabe. No written orders denying Shamblin's Motion for
Issuance of Order to Show Cause and Setting of Reasonable Bail or specifically
denying his "Writ of Habeas Corpus" appear in either case file.

 It should be noted that all documents filed by Shamblin bear this
civil case number, even after the court clerk, by way of letter datedFebruary 12, 2010, informed Shamblin that his "Writ of Habeas Corpus" relatingto Civil No. 09-1-2205 and Criminal Nos. 2PC 06-1-0507 and 07-1-0161 had been assigned S.P.P. No. 10-1-0011 and was treated as a nonconforming petition forpost-conviction relief pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
Rule 40(c)(2). Shamblin, however, did also list the S.P.P. number in thecaption of his Notice of Appeal.

not terminate the litigation, but instead ensured that Carefirst
 
remained in court, free to pursue its claims[,]" and therefore
 
was not a final order.) 
Nor does the Order of Case Transfer meet the standard 
set forth in Siangco v. Kasadate, 77 Hawai' i 157, 883 P.2d 78 
(1994) as a collateral order that is immediately appealable. The Order of Case Transfer did not conclusively determine any 
disputed question or resolve any important issue, and it was 
reviewable on appeal from a final judgment. Siangco, 77 Hawai' i 
at 161, 883 P.2d at 82. 
Finally, Shamblin did not obtain approval from the
 
circuit court to file an interlocutory appeal, as required by HRS
 ยง 641-1(b) (1993), therefore the Order of Case Transfer was not
 
appealable. As the Order of Case Transfer was not appealable,
 
the Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration of Order of Case
 
Transfer was not appealable.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
