Company, Ltd. (collectively, Defendants) and against Simpkins on
 

all claims2 pursuant to the court's "Order Granting [Defendants']
3
Motion for Summary Judgment"  (Summary Judgment Order) filed on
April 20, 2010 and "Order Regarding [Defendants'] Motion for
 
4
Attorneys' Fees and Costs"  (Attorneys' Fees and Costs Order)
filed on June 22, 2010.
 
On appeal, Simpkins contends the circuit court erred
 
when it (1) entered its Summary Judgment Order without giving due
 
consideration to the facts and (2) awarded Defendants their
 
attorneys' fees and costs when Simpkins followed the requirements
 
of the AOAO by-laws for resolving disputes, but the Board refused
 
to comply with the AOAO by-laws.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Simpkins'
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) Reviewing the circuit court's award of summary 
judgment de novo, Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai' i 48, 56, 109 
P.3d 689, 697 (2005), we hold that the circuit court did not err in finding that there were no genuine issues of material fact to 
be determined at trial. 
2
 In the order portion of the Judgment, the circuit court ordered a
money judgment in favor of Defendants and against Simpkins, but failed to set
forth that it was entering final judgment pursuant to the April 20, 2010Summary Judgment Order. Viewed as a whole, the Judgment appears to enterjudgment in favor of Defendants and against Simpkins as to all three counts inSimpkins' complaint. Therefore, the Judgment substantially complies with therequirements for an appealable judgment under Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule 58 and the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76Hawai'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).

Defendants met their burden of production, French v. 
Hawaii Pizza Hut, Inc., 105 Hawai' i 462, 470, 99 P.3d 1046, 1054 
(2004), when they showed that the Board's decision to monitor 
Building 10's shifting foundation problem was reasonable and made 
in good faith, citing to the previous actions of the Board, 
including installation of helical piers and anchors to reinforce 
the foundation, the engineering assessments and reviews, and the 
on-going monitoring of shifts in the foundation. McNamee v. 
Bishop Trust Co., 62 Haw. 397, 409, 616 P.2d 205, 213 (1980). 
After Defendants met their burden of production, 
Simpkins, as the opposing party, had the burden to show specific facts that raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether 
Defendants' decision to take no action was unreasonable and/or 
made in bad faith. Village Park Cmty. Ass'n v. Nishimura, 108 
Hawai'i 487, 501, 122 P.3d 267, 281 (App. 2005). Simpkins 
offered no evidence to show that Defendants' decision to take no 
immediate action was unreasonable or made in bad faith. Because 
Defendants met their burden of production and Simpkins failed to 
show specific facts that raised a genuine issue of material fact 
as to unreasonableness or bad faith, the circuit court properly 
granted Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. 
(2) Simpkins failed to argue why the circuit court's 
award of attorneys' fees and costs to Defendants should not have 
been granted; therefore, we deem this point waived. Hawai' i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived."); Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 
Hawai'i 438, 478, 164 P.3d 696, 736 (2007) (holding that "an 
appellate court is not obliged to address matters for which the appellant has failed to present discernible arguments"). 
Therefore,
