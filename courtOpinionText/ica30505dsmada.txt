NO. 30505
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
KATHLEEN B. WILKINS,
Plaintiff-Appellant, 
v.
 
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF MASSAGE THERAPY, a Hawaii corporation,
Defendant-Appellee,
 
and
 
JOHN DOES 1-10, JANE DOES 1-10, DOE CORPORATIONS 1-10, et al.,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 07-1-0514)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
 
FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that court lacks

 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Plaintiff-Appellant Kathleen B.
 
Wilkins (Appellant Wilkins) has asserted from the April 8, 2010
 judgment issued by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(circuit court) 1
, because Appellant Wilkins's May 18, 2010 notice
of appeal is untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai 'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
The April 8, 2010 judgment resolved all claims against 
all parties, and, thus, the April 8, 2010 judgment is an appealable final judgment in this case pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009), Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP), and the holding in 
Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai 'i 115, 119, 
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Appellant Wilkins did not file her May 18, 2010 notice
 
of appeal within thirty days after entry of the April 8, 2010

judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) requires. Therefore, Appellant
 
Wilkins's May 18, 2010 notice of appeal is untimely under HRAP
 Rule 4(a)(1). The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice thereof is authorized to change the jurisdictional
 requirements contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Consequently,
 we lack appellate jurisdiction over this case. Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number
 
30505 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
