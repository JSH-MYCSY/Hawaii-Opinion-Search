  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The family court found Dowling guilty of Abuse of
 
Family or Household Member, in violation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 709-906 (Supp. 2010).2
 
On appeal, Dowling contends (1) there was insufficient 
evidence to support his conviction because the State of Hawai' i 
(State) did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt facts that negate his claim of parental discipline; (2) the mental distress 
suffered by the complaining witness, Dowling's eleven-year-old 
3
; and (3)
 son (Minor), did not satisfy HRS § 703-309(1) (1993) Dowling's discipline was reasonably proportional to Minor's
 
misconduct and reasonably necessary to protect Minor's welfare.
 
2 HRS § 709-906 provides in relevant part: 
§709-906 Abuse of family or household members; penalty.
(1) It shall be unlawful for any person, singly or in concert, to
physically abuse a family or household member or to refuse
compliance with the lawful order of a police officer under
subsection (4).
 
For the purposes of this section, "family or household
member" means spouses or reciprocal beneficiaries, former spouses
or reciprocal beneficiaries, persons who have a child in common,
parents, children, persons related by consanguinity, and persons
jointly residing or formerly residing in the same dwelling unit.
3 HRS § 703-309(1) provides: 
§703-309 Use of force by persons with special
responsibility for care, discipline, or safety of others.  The use
 
of force upon or toward the person of another is justifiable under
the following circumstances:
 
(1)	 The actor is the parent or guardian or other person
similarly responsible for the general care and
supervision of a minor, or a person acting at the
request of the parent, guardian, or other responsible
person, and:
 
(a)	 The force is employed with due regard for the
age and size of the minor and is reasonably
related to the purpose of safeguarding or
promoting the welfare of the minor, including
the prevention or punishment of the minor's
misconduct; and
 
(b)	 The force used is not designed to cause or known
to create a risk of causing substantial bodily
injury, disfigurement, extreme pain or mental
distress, or neurological damage.

I.
 
On January 28, 2010, the State charged Dowling by
 
written complaint with Abuse of Family or Household Member. On
 
April 7, 2010, the family court presided over Dowling's one-day,
 
jury-waived trial.
 
The State called Minor to testify. Minor was first
 
shown several photographs, which he identified as having been
 
taken around Christmas 2009. Minor stated that the photographs
 
showed bruises on his legs.
 
Minor testified that after he finished vacuuming the
 
house, he put the vacuum back into the hall closet and tried to
 
close the closet door. He could not close the door because a rug
 
was stuck under it. Dowling was walking past the closet to get
 
to his room, but could not get past the open closet door. 
Dowling tried to fix the door, but could not, and he started
 
getting angry. Minor testified that he had caused the rug to get
 
stuck under the closet door, but when Dowling asked Minor if he
 
had caused the door to become stuck, Minor repeatedly denied
 
doing so. Dowling became angry because he thought Minor was
 
lying. Dowling then pushed Minor on the shoulder, and Minor fell
 
onto a bed in the parlor. At that point, Minor thought he was
 
going to get "lickin's" because he had lied about the closet
 
door. Dowling then hit Minor on the left leg twice while Minor
 
was in a fetal position with his knees up and his hands
 
protecting his face. Minor thought Dowling punched him with a
 
closed fist. Dowling stopped hitting him when Minor yelled,
 
began crying out loud, and told Dowling to stop. Minor stated
 
that when Dowling hit his leg, it hurt and his leg hurt "a little
 
bit" after the incident. He also stated that he was scared at
 
the time of the incident.
 
Minor informed his great grandmother about the incident
 
approximately one week later. Minor explained that he had
 
bruises on both his legs from falling down with a wheelbarrow
 
when he was cleaning the yard. Minor pointed out on his left leg
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the bruises that were made by Dowling and the bruises that were a
 
result of his fall with the wheelbarrow.
 
Minor's great grandmother testified that after church
 
services on Sunday, Minor asked her to come over to his house for
 
lunch. Minor began to cry when they were in the car and then
 
showed her his injuries.
 
Dowling's wife (Wife) testified that Minor complained
 
to her that it was unfair he had to vacuum the house while his
 
younger siblings were allowed to play outside. She stated that
 
she believed Minor denied three times that he had shoved the
 
closet door after Dowling confronted Minor and told him, "I am
 
right here watching you do what needs to be done, and you are
 
denying me in front of my face." Although she did not directly
 
observe Dowling hit Minor, she did see Dowling's body gesture and
 
concluded that Dowling had hit Minor. After being hit, Minor
 
admitted that he shoved the stuck door, and Dowling walked away. 
After the incident, Wife told Minor to continue doing his chores,
 
and Minor again complained that it was unfair. She testified
 
that three to seven days prior to the closet incident she had
 
seen bruising on Minor's left leg near his butt. She stated that
 
Minor did not appear more anxious and did not exhibit signs of
 
anxiety more than normal the week following the incident. 
Dowling testified that he saw Minor open the door to
 
put the vacuum cleaner in the closet without moving the rug in
 
front of the door and observed how the door got stuck on the rug. 
He asked Minor three or four times how the door got stuck, and
 
each time Minor denied opening the door on the rug. Dowling
 
demanded to know why Minor was lying and informed Minor that he
 
had observed what Minor did, but Minor "kept saying no, that he
 
never." Dowling became angry because Minor was lying in front of
 
him and Wife, and because lying was against the rules in the
 
house, he spanked Minor. He pushed Minor onto a bed that was in
 
the parlor. Dowling testified that he did not punch Minor on the
 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
leg, but rather hit Minor twice on the butt with an open palm and
 
his fingers together.
 
The family court found Minor's testimony to be credible
 
and believed that Dowling was extremely angry and pushed Minor
 
onto the bed, the last thing Minor saw was Dowling's fist, and
 
Minor got hit twice on his left side while covering his eyes. 
After acknowledging that Dowling had a right to discipline his
 
child, the family court stated: "But I think this case just went
 
a little bit too far. I think you lost your temper and you
 
punched your son." The family court went on to state:
 
Did you go overboard or not?
 
You know, there is [sic] bruises on him. They are not
huge bruises, but there are bruises.
 
You know, if I read 309 -- 709-309(1)(b), which states
the force used is not designed to cause, or known to cause,
or risk of causing substantial bodily injury.
 
Yes, you didn't break his bones. You didn't do
 
anything like that. It wasn't -- it didn't rise to that
 occasion. But, I do -- I do believe that it rose to mental
distress, and not just that he was going to get lickings at
the time. 
I think the evidence that the Court heard and
 
[Minor's] testimony of what happened the Sunday following
it, it was still on his mind. You know, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and he went to the
person he testified he trusted the most who would help him.
And he was that concerned about it, five days after the fact
to tell somebody about it. And I think that is what rises,
just this case goes over the edge just a little, you know,
that it did cause mental distress.
 
So I'm going to find you guilty of the offense of
abuse [of] family and household member.
 
After finding Dowling guilty of Abuse of Family or
 
Household Member, the family court filed the Judgment of
 
Probation on April 15, 2010. Dowling timely appealed. 
II.
 
A.
 
On appeal, Dowling contends the family court erred by
 
convicting him of Abuse of Family or Household Member because the
 
5
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
State failed to adduce substantial evidence negating his
 
justification defense of parental discipline.
 
To invoke the defense of justification under HRS § 703-309,
[the defendant] was required to make a showing that the
record contained evidence supporting the following elements:
(1) he was a parent, guardian, or other person as described
in HRS § 703-309(1); (2) he used force against a minor for
whose care and supervision he was responsible; (3) his use
of force was with due regard to the age and size of the
recipient and reasonably related to the purpose of
safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the minor,
including the prevention or punishment of misconduct; and
(4) the force used was not designed to cause, or known to
create a risk of causing, substantial bodily injury,
disfigurement, extreme pain or mental distress, or
neurological damage. See State v. Kaimimoku, 9 Haw. App.
345, 349-50, 841 P.2d 1076, 1079 (1992). In turn, the
prosecution had the burden of disproving beyond a reasonable
doubt the justification evidence that was adduced, or
proving beyond a reasonable doubt facts negativing the
justification defense. Id. at 350, 841 P.2d at 1079.
 
State v. Crouser, 81 Hawai' i 5, 10-11, 911 P.2d 725, 730-31 
(1996) (footnote omitted). 
The family court found that Dowling's use of force
 
caused mental distress to Minor. Based upon that finding, the
 
family court found that the State satisfied its burden of
 
disproving beyond a reasonable doubt Dowling's assertion of the
 
parental discipline defense under HRS § 703-309(1)(b). The
 
family court also found that Dowling's use of force caused
 
bruising to Minor because Dowling lost his temper and "just went
 
a little bit too far." Therefore, the family court found that
 
the State satisfied its burden of disproving beyond a reasonable
 
doubt Dowling's assertion of parental discipline defense under
 
HRS § 703-309(1)(a).
 
In Crouser, the defendant, citing to State v. DeLeon,
 
72 Haw. 241, 813 P.2d 1382 (1991), and State v. Kaimimoku, 9 Haw.
 
App. 345, 841 P.2d 1076 (1992), contended that his use of force
 
was justifiable under HRS § 703-309(1)(b) when compared to prior
 
cases interpreting extreme pain under the cannon of construction

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of noscitur a sociis.4 Crouser, 81 Hawai' i at 12-13, 911 P.2d at 
732-33. The Hawai' i Supreme Court stated: 
As previously stated, HRS § 703-309(1) was amended in
1992 for the express purpose of "reducing the permitted
level of force that a person responsible for the care of a
minor . . . may use." Hse. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 103, in
1992 House Journal, at 843. In order to accomplish the
purpose, "the standard of harm [was] lowered by lowering the
level of risk, and reducing the permissible level of injury
to that which is less than "substantial" as defined in
 section 707-700 of the Hawaii Penal Code." Sen. Stand.
 Comm. Rep. No. 2208, in 1992 Senate Journal, at 1023. The
 changes made reflect the legislature's concern with results
of the noscitur a sociis analysis employed in DeLeon.
 
"Death" and "gross degradation" were removed from the
enumerated prohibited results because "the lower threshold
makes [them] surplusage and [their] elimination removes the
risk of other words in that paragraph being interpreted
'noscitur a sociis' with . . . term[s] that [are] not
pertinent to the lower threshold." Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep.
No. 2493, in 1992 Senate Journal, at 1121; Hse. Conf. Comm.
Rep. No. 2613, in 1992 House Journal, at 843. "As a result
 of these changes, the terms retained from the prior law must
be reinterpreted by the courts, since the changes affect the
application of the rule of construction applied in 
State v.
 
DeLeon, 72 Haw. 241, 813 P.2d 1382 (1991)." Sen. Stand.
 
Comm. Rep. No. 2493, in 1992 Senate Journal, at 1121
(parenthetical omitted).
 
Id. at 13, 911 P.2d at 733 (emphasis added).
 
This court has not had an occasion to decide a case
 
involving the mental distress provision in HRS § 703-309(1)(b),
 
either prior to or after the 1992 statutory amendment. 
In Crouser, the supreme court stated:
 
Subsection (b) of HRS § 703-309(1) defines the maximum
degree of force that is justifiable under the statute.
Subsection (a), as amended, makes clear that physical
discipline may be so excessive that it is no longer
reasonably related to safeguarding the welfare of the minor,
even if it does not exceed the bounds set in subsection (b).
 
Id. at 12, 911 P.2d at 732. "[B]ecause the requirements of HRS
 
§ 703-309(1) are set out in the conjunctive, rather than the
 
disjunctive, the prosecution needed only to disprove one element
 
beyond a reasonable doubt to defeat the justification defense." 
4 Noscitur a sociis is Latin for "it is known by its associates" and is
 
"[a] cannon of construction holding that the meaning of an unclear word or
phrase should be determined by the words immediately surrounding it." Black's
 
Law Dictionary 1160-61 (9th ed. 2009); see also, Crouser, 81 Hawai' i at 13 
n.6, 911 P.2d at 733 n.6.

State v. Tanielu, 82 Hawai' i 373, 380, 922 P.2d 986, 993 (App. 
1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
 
Thus, we first review whether Dowling's use of force
 
exceeded the maximum degree of force that is justifiable under
 
HRS § 703-309(1)(b) because exceeding such force is not
 
justifiable as parental discipline. 
Even if the State did not
 
disprove that Dowling's use of force exceeded the maximum degree
 of force that is justifiable, we must examine whether his use of
 
force was excessive so that it was no longer reasonably related
 
to safeguarding the welfare of Minor.
 
B.
 
The family court's finding that Dowling's action caused
 
mental distress appears to be based, at least in part, on the
 
fact that bruising resulted from Dowling's action. However, the
 
Hawai
'i Supreme Court recently affirmed that the proper focus of 
the family court's inquiry is whether a defendant's action was
 designed to cause or was known to create a risk of causing
 
substantial bodily injury, disfigurement, extreme pain or mental
 
distress, or neurological damage, not whether the force caused a
 
prohibited result. In State v. Kikuta, 125 Hawai' i 78, 253 P.3d 
639 (2011), the supreme court stated:
 
Thus, under HRS § 703-309(1)(b), in some instances,
criminal liability will attach to a defendant even though a
defendant's use of force did not result in substantial
 
bodily injury, so long as the force used by the defendant
was designed to cause or known to create a risk of
substantial bodily injury. See [State v. Miller, 105
Hawai'i 394, 401, 98 P.3d 265, 272 (2004)] (affirming the
family court's rejection of the defendant's parental
discipline defense, based in part, on the family court's
finding that although the force used on the minor did not
result in any serious injury, "striking the victim about the
head did create the risk of causing substantial bodily
injury or neurological damage"). Conversely, then, the
defense instruction is not precluded if substantial bodily
injury results, but the force used was not designed to cause
or known to create a risk of substantial bodily injury.
[State v. Kikuta, 123 Hawai' i 299, 233 P.3d 719 (App. 2010)]
2010 WL 2017646, at *10. Based on the foregoing, although
acting conscientiously, the court erred in determining that
[Kikuta] was precluded from having the jury instructed on
the parental discipline defense because the force used
against Complainant resulted in substantial bodily injury.
The plain language of the statute specifically ties the
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
defense to criminal liability to the nature of the force
used as opposed to the result of such use of force.
 
Id. at 88-89, 253 P.3d at 649-50 (emphasis added).
 
Additionally, the family court's finding that Dowling's
 
action caused mental distress, as opposed to extreme mental
 
distress, disregarded the plain language of HRS § 703-309(1)(b),
 
which clearly indicates that the word "extreme" modifies "pain or
 
mental distress." 
There are several Hawai' i cases which refer to or 
interpret "extreme pain." DeLeon, 72 Haw. at 244, 813 P.2d at 
1383-84 (extreme pain analogous to extreme mental distress); Crouser, 81 Hawai' i at 13, 911 P.2d at 733 (reinterpretation of 
extreme pain after statutory amendment); State v. Miller, 105 Hawai'i 394, 402, 98 P.3d 265, 273 (App. 2004) (term extreme pain 
interpreted "noscitur a sociis with substantial bodily injury"). 
Hawai'i case law indicates that the word "extreme" in 
HRS § 703-309(1)(b) modifies "mental distress." In DeLeon, the Hawai'i Supreme Court stated: 
Given the facts here, viewed in the light most
favorable to the State, the pain inflicted upon Penelope by
her father in the course of the incident in question, does
not come, in degree, anywhere near death, serious bodily
injury, disfigurement, extreme mental distress or gross
degradation. It therefore was not, as a matter of law,
serious pain.
 
DeLeon, 72 Haw. at 244, 813 P.2d at 1384 (emphasis added;
 
footnote omitted). In Crouser, the supreme court restated its
 
interpretation of HRS § 703-309(1)(b) in DeLeon as follows:
 
Crouser asserts that, because the force he used on
 
Minor did not exceed the level applied in State v. DeLeon,
 
72 Haw. 241, 813 P.2d 1382 (1991), and in Kaimimoku, it was
 justifiable under HRS § 703-309(1)(b). In DeLeon, the trial
court convicted the defendant based upon its finding that he
was guilty of causing "extreme pain" when he struck his
fourteen-year-old daughter six to ten times with a folded
belt above the knee and over her pants. The daughter had
testified that "she felt a little pain, that the spanking
stung her, and that the pain lasted an hour and a half. She
 had bruises for about a week. She cried for half an hour."
 72 Haw. at 242, 813 P.2d at 1383. Because the phrase
"extreme pain" was not defined in the statute, this court
employed "an ancient canon of construction," noscitur a
 sociis, and reasoned that the pain inflicted did not come
 
9
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
anywhere near, in degree, the other statutorily forbidden
results. Thus, we held that the defendant's conduct was
justified under HRS § 703-309(1) and reversed the
conviction. Id. at 244-45, 813 P.2d at 1383-84. We note
 
that, at the time DeLeon was decided, the other prohibited
results were death, serious bodily injury, disfigurement,
extreme mental distress, or gross degradation. Id.
 
Crouser, 81 Hawai' i at 12-13, 911 P.2d at 732-33 (emphasis added; 
footnote omitted).5 Therefore, HRS § 703-309(1)(b), according to
 
DeLeon and Crouser, prohibits force that is designed to cause or
 
is known to create the risk of causing extreme mental distress,
 
not merely mental distress.
 
C.
 
There is no statutory definition of "extreme mental
 
distress" within HRS Chapter 703. There is no Hawai' i case that 
defines extreme mental distress within the context of HRS § 703­309(1)(b).
 
"The terms 'emotional distress,' 'mental anguish,' and
 
'mental distress' are synonymous." First Ins. Co. of Hawai' i, 
Ltd. v. Lawrence, 77 Hawai' i 2, 7 n.9, 881 P.2d 489, 494 n.9 
(1994). Black's Law Dictionary 601 (9th ed. 2009) provides:
 
"Emotional distress passes under various names, such as
mental suffering, mental anguish, mental or nervous shock,
or the like. It includes all highly unpleasant mental
reactions, such as fright, horror, grief, shame,
humiliation, embarrassment, anger, chagrin, disappointment,
worry, and nausea. It is only where it is extreme that the
liability arises. Complete emotional tranquility is seldom
attainable in this world, and some degree of transient and
trivial emotional distress is a part of the price of living
among people. The law intervenes only where the distress
inflicted is so severe that no reasonable man could be
 expected to endure it. The intensity and the duration of
the distress are factors to be considered in determining its
severity. Severe distress must be proved; but in many cases
the extreme and outrageous character of the defendant's
conduct is in itself important evidence that the distress
has existed." Restatement (Second) of Torts § 46 cmt. j
(1965).
 
By requiring the mental distress to be extreme, the
 
plain language of HRS § 703-309(1)(b) clearly prohibits force
 
5 The 1992 statutory amendment did not affect the language in HRS
§ 703-309(1) regarding "extreme . . . mental distress."
 
10
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that is designed to cause or known to create the risk of causing
 
something more than the ordinary definition of emotional or
 
mental distress. 
In Rodrigues v. State, 52 Haw. 156, 472 P.2d 509
 
(1970), the Hawai' i Supreme Court first recognized the tort of 
negligent infliction of mental distress without a showing of
 physical injury. The court stated:
 
We propose a standard similar to that adopted by the
Restatement with regard to the intentional infliction of
mental distress. See Restatement Second, Torts § 46 comment
j at 77. Courts and juries which have applied the standard
of conduct of "the reasonable man of ordinary prudence" are
competent to apply a standard of serious mental distress
based upon the reaction of "the reasonable man." Cf.
 
Prosser, Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering; A New
 
Tort, 37 Mich. L. Rev. 874 (1939). We hold that a serious
 
mental distress may be found where a reasonable man,
normally constituted, would be unable to adequately cope
with the mental stress engendered by the circumstances of
the case.
 
Id. at 173, 472 P.2d at 520. 
The legislative intent of the 1992 statutory amendment
 
to HRS § 703-309(1) also indicates that "the standards in the new
 
law should be interpreted in light of the age of the child." 
S. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2493, in 1992 Senate Journal, at 1121. 
Thus, the finder of fact should employ a reasonable person
 
standard that considers the minor's age when determining whether
 
a defendant's action was designed to cause or was known to create
 
the risk of causing extreme mental distress. 
D.
 
In its reasoning for concluding that Dowling was guilty
 
of Abuse of Family or Household Member, the family court found
 
that Dowling's action caused mental distress (not extreme mental
 
distress). Such a finding was not sufficient to negate Dowling's
 
assertion of a parental discipline defense. 
In Tanielu, the defendant claimed the family court's
 
finding that he caused a laceration was insufficient to disprove
 
the parental discipline defense because a finding that the injury
 
was a "major" laceration was required to satisfy the "substantial
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
bodily injury" requirement of HRS § 703-309(1)(b). Tanielu, 82 
Hawai'i at 379-80, 922 P.2d at 992-93. This court held that the 
word "major," as used in defining the term "substantial bodily 
injury" in HRS § 707-700 (Supp. 2010), modified the word 
"laceration." Tanielu, 82 Hawai' i at 379, 922 P.2d at 992. 
Thus, this court concluded that "[w]hen the family court apparently failed to apply the legal requirement that lacerations 
suffered by Daughter or for which she was put at risk were or 
would be 'major,' it reversibly erred." Id. 
In the instant case, when the family court found that
 
Dowling's action was designed to cause or was known to create the
 
risk of causing mental distress (rather than extreme mental
 
distress), it was insufficient to disprove the parental
 
discipline defense. 
However, assuming arguendo, that the family court 
utilized the proper legal standard, the evidence does not support 
a finding of extreme mental distress. The evidence adduced at 
trial was that Dowling punched Minor's left leg twice with enough 
force to cause bruising. The family court noted that the 
incident was still on the mind of Minor nearly a week later. 
However, we have concluded there is not substantial evidence that 
Dowling's punching Minor twice on Minor's left leg was designed 
to cause or was known to create the risk of causing extreme 
mental distress, beyond that associated with the discipline 
itself, such that an eleven-year-old child would be unable to 
cope with the mental distress engendered by the circumstances of 
the case. State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 135, 913 P.2d 57, 61 
(1996). There is also nothing in the record to indicate that such force was known to create the risk of causing extreme mental 
distress. Therefore, the State did not disprove beyond a 
reasonable doubt Dowling's parental discipline defense under HRS 
§ 703-309(1)(b). 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
E.
 
We must next examine whether Dowling's physical 
discipline was so excessive that it was no longer reasonably 
related to safeguarding the welfare of Minor, even if it did not 
exceed the bounds set in subsection (b) of HRS § 703-309(1). 
Crouser, 81 Hawai' i at 10-11, 911 P.2d at 731-32. 
There is no dispute that Dowling is a parent of Minor
 
and he used force against Minor, for whose care and supervision
 
he was responsible. Therefore, Dowling satisfied the first two
 
elements of the parental discipline defense under HRS § 703­
309(1)(a).
 
Dowling claimed he hit Minor because Minor had 
repeatedly lied to him even after he informed Minor that he 
witnessed Minor cause the door to become stuck. Dowling 
maintains he satisfied the third element of HRS § 703-309(1)(a) 
because he made a showing that his "use of force was with due 
regard to the age and size of the recipient and reasonably 
related to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare 
of the minor, including the prevention or punishment of 
misconduct." Crouser, 81 Hawai' i at 10-11, 911 P.2d at 730-31. 
If so, the burden shifted to the State to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt Dowling's justification evidence or prove beyond 
a reasonable doubt facts negating the justification defense. Id. 
at 11, 911 P.2d at 731. 
"[T]o be 'reasonably related' to the purpose of 
punishing misconduct, use of force must be both reasonably 
proportional to the misconduct being punished and reasonably 
believed necessary to protect the welfare of the recipient." Id. 
at 12, 911 P.2d at 732. 
The family court noted that Dowling's
 
bruising of Minor and acting out of anger when disciplining Minor
 
were the reasons Dowling's discipline was not reasonably related
 
to the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the welfare of Minor. 
On appeal, the State points to the same factors as substantial
 
evidence that it disproved Dowling's parental discipline defense.

In Miller, this court affirmed the defendant's 
conviction for abuse of a family or household member when the 
"viciousness of the attack [Miller] was involved in severed any 
relationship between the use of force and the welfare" of the 
complaining witness that "might be considered reasonable." 105 
Hawai'i at 395 & 402, 98 P.3d at 266 & 273. In Miller, the 
complaining witness testified that Miller attempted to pick him up by his ear and hair; kicked him; and hit him five times with a 
fist to his face, ribs, and maybe back. Id. at 396, 98 P.3d at 
267. The complaining witness's injuries were described as
 
scratches to the right side of his face and ears; pain in his
 
head, back, and ribs; and a lump on the back of his head. Id.
 
In State v. Matavale
, 115 Hawai' i 149, 166 P.3d 322 
(2007), the Hawai' i Supreme Court stated: 
As other courts have recently expressed and we agree, 
an isolated instance of moderate or reasonable
 
physical force . . . that results in nothing more than
transient pain or temporary marks or bruises is
protected under the parental discipline privilege.
 
This protection for parents should exist even if
the parent acts out of frustration or short temper.
Parents do not always act with calmness of mind or
considered judgment when upset with, or concerned
about, their children's behavior. 
Nor do parents
always act pursuant to a clearly defined circumstance
of discipline or control. A reaction often occurs
 from behavior a parent deems inappropriate that
irritates or angers the parent, causing a reactive,
demonstrative act. Heat of the moment must not result
 in immoderate physical force and must be managed;
however, an angry moment driving moderate or
reasonable discipline is often part and parcel of the
real world of parenting with which prosecutors and
courts should not interfere. What parent among us can
say he or she has not been angered to some degree from
a child's defiant, impudent, or insolent conduct,
sufficient to call for spontaneous, stern, and
meaningful discipline?
 
State v. Lefevre, [138 N.M. 174, 178-79, 117 P.3d 980, 984­85 (N.M. Ct. App. 2005)].
 
Id. at 166, 166 P.3d at 339. 
In 
Kikuta, the Hawai' i Supreme Court recently affirmed 
its holding in Matavale and added:

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
This court has acknowledged on another occasion that
the fact that the use of force may have arisen out of anger
or short temper[] does not automatically mean that such
force was not reasonably related to the purpose of
safeguarding or promoting the welfare of the minor, or for
the prevention or punishment of misconduct.
 
Kikuta, 125 Hawai' i at 91, 253 P.3d at 652. 
In Matavale, the supreme court, quoting a Hawai' i 
senate standing committee report, stated:
 
In 1992, the legislature, in considering an amendment
to HRS § 703-309(1) (1985), expressly recognized -- through
the adoption of a standing committee report by the Senate
Judiciary Committee -- that
 
the line between physical abuse and appropriate
parental discipline is a very subjective one. What
 one parent considers discipline may seem abusive to
another. Your Committee had to consider how best to
 
draw the line in the context of the legal defense
 
provided for parents [and] guardians . . . when
determining guilt in a criminal trial. Your Committee
 
believes that the "gray areas" must be resolved by not
 
criminalizing such parental discipline, even if a
 majority of the community would find the extent of the
 punishment inappropriate.
 
Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 2493, in 1992 Senate Journal, at
1121 (emphases added).
 
Matavale, 115 Hawai' i at 160-61, 166 P.3d at 333-34. Considering 
the evidence in Matavale, the Hawai' i Supreme Court concluded, as 
a matter of law, that the State failed to present sufficient 
evidence to negate the defendant's parental discipline defense. 
115 Hawai' i at 164-68, 166 P.3d at 337-41. Because Matavale's 
fourteen-year-old daughter lied about attending tutoring classes and forgetting her report card at school and refused to answer 
Matavale's questions about the report card and classes, Matavale 
hit daughter with a plastic backpack, a plastic hanger, the flat 
side of a car brush, and the plastic handle of a tool, leaving a 
few markings on daughter's arm and small bruises. Id. at 151-54, 
166 P.3d at 324-27. 
Although Dowling's punches were forceful enough to
 
cause bruising, they were not forceful enough to rise to the
 level of viciousness in Miller, in which the level of attack
 
"severed any relationship between the use of force and the
 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
welfare" of the complaining witness that "might be considered 
reasonable." 105 Hawai' i at 402, 98 P.3d at 273. It is at most 
a "gray area" in which some of the community would find that Dowling's extent of punishment was inappropriate. However, under 
Matavale, such gray areas are not resolved by criminalizing such 
parental discipline. Therefore, there was insufficient evidence 
to disprove Dowling's parental discipline defense under HRS 
§ 703-309(1)(a).
