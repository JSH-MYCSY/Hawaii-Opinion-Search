DAVID SCRIVNER, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 07-1-0032; CRIMINAL NO. 03-1-0787)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant David Scrivner (Scrivner) appeals 
from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting 
the State of Hawai' i's Motion for Reconsideration in Light of New 
Case Law and Denying Petition for Post-Conviction Relief filed on 
May 28, 2010 (Order) in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit 
(Circuit Court).1 
On June 6, 2003, Scrivner pled no contest to Escape in
 
the Second Degree and Robbery in the Second Degree.  On August
 
14, 2003, a judgment of conviction and sentence was entered in
 
which Scrivner was sentenced to five years imprisonment for
 
Escape in the Second Degree, 10 years imprisonment for Robbery in
 
the Second Degree, a mandatory minimum of six years and eight

months, and to an extended term of imprisonment on both counts
 
which doubled his sentences to 10 and 20 years respectively.
 
Scrivner did not appeal his conviction.
 
On August 23, 2007, Scrivner filed a Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner 
From Custody (Petition), pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 40. 
On appeal, Scrivner contends that his extended term of 
imprisonment is illegal because State v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai' i 
432, 168 P.3d 562 (2007) (Maugaotega II) invalidated Hawaii 
Revised Statute (HRS) ยง 706-662 and that HRS ยง 706-662 was void 
ab initio. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Scrivner's point of error as follows:
 
Contrary to Scrivner's argument, Maugaotega II does not 
apply retroactively to cases that became final before Maugaotega 
II was decided. Loher v. State, 118 Hawai' i 522, 537-38, 193 
P.3d 438, 453-54 (App. 2008). Scrivner's sentence to an extended term of imprisonment was not void ab initio. See State v. Jess, 
117 Hawai' i 381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008) and Loher, supra; State v. 
Cutsinger, 118 Hawai' i 68, 81, 185 P.3d 816, 829 (App. 2008), 
overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Jess, 117 Hawai' i 
381, 184 P.3d 133 (2008).
