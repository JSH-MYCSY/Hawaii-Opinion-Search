NO. 30510
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
THE ESTATE OF PAMELA ROSE CROSBY, Deceased
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(PROBATE NO. 09-1-0013)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over the appeal that Respondent-Appellant Henry
 
Chester Crosby, III (Appellant Henry Crosby III) has asserted
 from the Honorable Elizabeth Strance's April 19, 2010 "Order
 Affirming Intestacy of Decedent, Appointment of Personal
 Respresentative and Transfer[r]ing Case Back to Informal
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Intestacy Proceeding" (the April 19, 2010 order of intestacy and
 
determination of heirs) because the April 19, 2010 order of
 intestacy and determination of heirs is not independently
 appealable pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)
 (1993 & Supp. 2010) and Rule 34 of the Hawai' i Probate Rules 
(HPR).
 
HRS § 641-1(a)authorizes appeals from a probate court's
 
final judgments, orders, or decrees, which "shall be taken in the
 manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641­1(c). HPR Rule 34 generally requires the entry of a judgment for
 an appeal:
 
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of
the court. Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed
pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions.
 
HPR Rule 34 (emphases added). "Rule 34 is written to conform
 
probate practice to the policy against piecemeal appeals, see,
 e.g., Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Haw. 115, 869
 P.2d 1334, 1994 Haw. LEXIS 19 (1994), to bring certainty to the
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
timing of when and how an appeal can be taken, and to comply with 
the provisions of HRS § 641-1." Michie's Hawaii Revised Statues 
Annotated Court Rules, HPR Rule 34 cmt. (Michie 2010). "An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
Therefore, under HRS § 641-1 and HPR Rule 34, a probate court order of intestacy and determination of heirs is eligible for appellate review only if the probate court reduces the order to a separate and final judgment pursuant to HPR Rule 34(a). 
On July 19, 2010, the appellate court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal for Appeal No. 30510, at which time the record
 on appeal did not contain a final judgment pursuant to HPR Rule
 34. Therefore, the April 19, 2010 order of intestacy and
 
determination of heirs is not eligible for appellate review
 pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) and HPR Rule 34.
 
Although common law exceptions to the final judgment
 
requirement exist under the Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848),
 doctrine (the Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine,
 the April 19, 2010 order of intestacy and determination of heirs
 does not satisfy all of the requirements for appealability under
 the Forgay doctrine or the collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla
 
v. Reddish, 78 Hawai' i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) 
(regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
requirements for appealability under the collateral order
 
doctrine).
 
Absent an appealable judgment or an appealable order
 
that satisfies the requirements for an appeal under HRS § 641-1(a)
 and HPR Rule 34, this appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction. Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal
 is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
