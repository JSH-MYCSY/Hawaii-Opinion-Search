points of error on appeal in this case, those claims are waived. 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b)(4). 
In his Opening Brief, Points of Error section, Mason

41, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49, 52, 53, 55, 56, 63, 86, 100, 101, 102,
 
103, 104, 108, 109, 110, 111, 121, 122, 134, 135, 136, and 137
 
and Conclusions of Law 1 through 26, as well as the circuit
 
court's use of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard when
 
evaluating the proffered testimony of potential witnesses to the
 
hearing on the Petition for Post-Conviction Relief. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Mason's appeal is without merit.

 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying Petitioner's Petition for
 Post-Conviction Relief filed on April 26, 2010 in the Circuit
