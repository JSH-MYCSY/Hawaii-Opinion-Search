IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
LAWRENCE PAI, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-10-00706)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Lawrence Pai (Pai) appeals the
 
April 9, 2010 Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order and
 
Plea/Judgment filed in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 
1
Honolulu Division (District Court)  that convicted him of
Operating a Vehicle Under the Influence of an Intoxicant (OVUII),
 
in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291E-61(a)(3)
 
(Supp. 2009).
 
On January 25, 2010, a Complaint was filed charging Pai
 
with OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3). 
On
 
April 8, 2010, the date of trial, Pai filed and argued a Motion
 to Dismiss, asserting that the Complaint failed to allege state
 
of mind, thus failing to state an essential fact and failing to

give Pai adequate notice of the charge, and the District Court
 
therefore did not have jurisdiction. The District Court denied
 
the motion. Also on April 8, 2010, the State arraigned Pai on
 
the Complaint. Pai orally renewed his motion to dismiss for lack
 
of subject matter jurisdiction as stated in his written motion,
 
and the District Court noted that it had already denied the
 
motion. Trial proceeded on April 8 and 9, 2010. At the
 
conclusion of trial, the District Court found Pai guilty under
 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) and entered its judgment of conviction. This
 
timely appeal followed.
 
On appeal, Pai contends that the District Court erred
 
in denying his motion to dismiss the charge and in consequently
 
convicting him because the charge failed to specify the
 
applicable state of mind and thus did not state an essential fact
 
necessary for conviction. Pai contends the complaint failed to
 
provide adequate notice of the charge and was inadequate to
 
confer jurisdiction on the District Court.
 
The State argues that OVUII under subsection (a)(3),
 
the subsection under which Pai was convicted, is a per se offense
 
that did not require a state of mind in the charge. The State
 
does not present argument on subsection (a)(1), under which Pai
 
was also charged.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Pai's points of error as follows.
 
Pai argues that the District Court erred in denying his 
Motion to Dismiss because the failure to specify the requisite 
state of mind, required as an essential fact pursuant to Rule 
7(d) of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP), renders the

Complaint defective. Pai was charged in the Complaint with
 
violating HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3).2
 
I.	 State of Mind under HRS § 291E-61.
A.	 HRS § 291E-61(a)(3) (breath alcohol content) provides
for absolute liability.
 
As to the state of mind requirement for Pai's charge
 
under HRS § 291E-61(a)(3), OVUII determined by alcohol content is
 
an absolute liability offense. State v. Young, 8 Haw. App. 145,
 
3
 see also H. Stand. Comm. Rep.
 153-154, 795 P.2d 285, 291 (1990);No. 591, in 1983 House Journal, at 1105; S. Stand. Comm. Rep.
 
No. 999, in 1983 Senate Journal, at 1478. 
The state of mind requirements of HRS § 702-204 (1993)
 
do not apply to a crime outside the penal code where a
 
legislative purpose to impose absolute liability plainly appears,
 
and no state of mind is required in the charge. HRS § 702-212
 
(1993); 
see also HRS § 701-102(3) (1993) ("[t]he provisions of
 
chapters 701 through 706 of the [Penal] Code are applicable to
 offenses defined by other statutes, unless the Code otherwise
 
2 HRS § 291E-61(a) (Supp. 2009) stated:
 
Operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant.  (a) A
person commits the offense of operating a vehicle under the
influence of an intoxicant if the person operates or assumes
actual physical control of a vehicle:
 
(1)	 While under the influence of alcohol in an amount
 sufficient to impair the person's normal mental
faculties or ability to care for the person and guard
against casualty;
 
(2)	 While under the influence of any drug that impairs the
person's ability to operate the vehicle in a careful
and prudent manner;
 
(3)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per two hundred ten
liters of breath; or
 
(4)	 With .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred
milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood. 
3
 HRS § 291-4, which was the statute at issue in Young, was recodified 
and reenacted as HRS § 291E-61. See State v. Anger, 105 Hawai' i 423, 425 n.2,
98 P.3d 630, 632 n.2 (2004). 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
provides" (emphasis and brackets added); see also State v. Kane,
 
3 Haw. App. 450, 453-54, 652 P.2d 642, 645 (1982).
 
B.	 HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) (impairment by alcohol) requires an
intentional, knowing, or reckless state of mind.
 
Although OVUII under subsection (a)(3) (breath alcohol
 
content) is an absolute liability offense, OVUII under subsection
 
(a)(1), which requires a showing of impairment, does not reflect
 
the same legislative intent to create an absolute liability
 
offense. Consequently, the state of mind requirements of
 
HRS § 702-204 apply to OVUII under subsection (a)(1). 
HRS § 701-102(3); see also HRS § 701-102 cmt. (making state of
 
mind requirements applicable to non-Penal-Code statutory
 
offenses). Thus, as no state of mind is specified in
 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), the state of mind of intentionally,
 
knowingly, or recklessly would apply.
 
II.	 State of Mind in the Charge.
 
Irrespective of the state of mind to be proved under 
HRS § 291E-61(a)(1), whether that state of mind must be alleged 
in the charging document is a separate matter. The issue of 
whether a charge contains all essential elements of the offense 
is reviewed de novo. State v. Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i 383, 390, 219 
P.3d 1170, 1177 (2009). 
The Wheeler court analyzed a district court case for 
sufficiency of the charge and stated that "an accusation must 
sufficiently allege all of the essential elements of the offense 
charged, a requirement that obtains whether an accusation is in 
the nature of an oral charge, information, indictment, or 
complaint." 121 Hawai' i at 391, 219 P.3d at 1178 (citation 
omitted, emphasis added, internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Wheeler also referenced HRS § 702-205, which specifies 
the elements of the offense as the conduct, attendant 
circumstances, and results of conduct. 121 Hawai' i at 391-92, 
219 P.3d at 1178-79. As determined in State v. Klinge, 92 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i 577, 584 n.3, 994 P.2d 509, 516 n.3 (2000), "under HRS 
§ 702-205, state of mind is not an 'element' of a criminal 
offense." Nevertheless, state of mind must be proved. See HRS 
§§ 701-102(3) and 702-204. 
Contrary to Pai's claim that state of mind is required
 
in the charge as part of the "essential facts" mandated in HRPP
 
4
Rule 7(d),  "[i]n general, where the statute sets forth with
reasonable clarity all 
essential elements of the crime intended 
to be punished, and fully defines the offense in unmistakable terms readily comprehensible to persons of common understanding, 
a charge drawn in the language of the statute is sufficient." 
State v. Mita, 124 Hawai' i 385, 392, 245 P.3d 458, 465 (2010) 
(quoting Wheeler, 121 Hawai' i at 393, 219 P.3d at 1180) (emphasis 
and some brackets added; internal quotation marks and some 
brackets omitted) (referencing the "plain, concise and definite 
statement of essential facts" requirement of HRPP Rule 7(d)). 
As noted, the language of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) does not 
specify the applicable state of mind required for conviction. 
Looking to the language of the statute in analyzing the 
sufficiency of a charge can be a determinative factor, and even 
though the provisions of HRS § 806-28 (1993) are not applicable 
to district court proceedings, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has 
similarly relied on the language of the particular criminal statute to determine if state of mind needed to be specified in a 
charge in district court proceedings. See State v. Yonaha, 68 
Haw. 586, 586, 723 P.2d 185, 185-186 (1986); State v. Faulkner, 
4 HRPP Rule 7(d) states, in part:
 
(d) Nature and Contents. The charge shall be a plain, concise and
definite statement of the essential facts constituting the offense
charged. . . . Formal defects, including erroneous reference to
the statute, rule, regulation or other provision of law, or the
omission of such reference, shall not be ground for dismissal of
the charge or for reversal of a conviction if the defect did not
prejudice the defendant.

61 Haw. 177, 178, 599 P.2d 285, 286 (1979); State v. Jendrusch,
 
58 Haw. 279, 281-282, 567 P.2d 1242, 1244 (1977).5
 
Further, in a charge of OVUII under HRS § 291E­
6
61(a)(1), a general intent crime,  the state of mind can be
inferred without specification in the charge.7 Consequently, the
 
charge against Pai of OVUII under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) does not
 
require specification of the state of mind. 
Accordingly, the District Court did not err in denying 
Pai's Motion to Dismiss and consequently convicting Pai. 
Therefore, the District Court's April 9, 2010 Notice of 
Entry of Judgment and/or Order and Plea/Judgment is affirmed.

5 Although these cases refer to state of mind as an "element," these
cases preceded State v. Klinge, 92 Hawai' i at 584 n.3, 994 P.2d at 516 n.3,
which clarified that state of mind is not an essential element of an offense.

Mollenberg v. State, 907 So.2d 554, 556 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2005); State v.
Creamer, 996 P.2d 339, 345 (Kan.Ct.App. 2000).

 See Kane, 3 Haw. App. at 457, 652 P.2d at 647-48 ("With a general
 
intent crime, the statement of the act itself implies the requisite intent.");
State v. Bull, 61 Haw. 62, 66, 597 P.2d 10, 13 (1979) ("the intent may be
inferred from the conduct of the accused and the circumstances and environment
 of the occurrence"); Territory v. Tacuban, 40 Haw. 208, 212 (1953) ("An
allegation of participation or taking part in a gambling game connotes guilty
knowledge, and inferentially alleges scienter."); State v. McDowell, 66 Haw.
650, 651, 672 P.2d 554, 555 (1983) ("Both [the carrying firearm charge in Kane
and possession of firearm charge in McDowell] are general intent crimes and
neither section specifies the requisite general intent to prove the crime.")
