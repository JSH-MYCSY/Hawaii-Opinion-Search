NO. 30526
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
IN THE INTEREST OF IO
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 08-11739)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Father-Appellant (Father) and Mother-Appellant
 
(Mother) (collectively, Parents) separately appeal from the Order
 
Awarding Permanent Custody (Order) entered on May 11, 2010 in the
 
Family Court of the First Circuit (family court).1 In the Order,
 
the family court found, among other things, that Parents were not
 willing or able to provide their child, IO, with a safe family
 
home, even with the assistance of a service plan, and would not
 
become willing or able to do so within a reasonable period of
 
time. The court granted the Department of Human Services'
 
(DHS's) Motion for Order Awarding Permanent Custody and
 
Establishing a Permanent Plan (Motion for Permanent Custody),
 
divested Parents' rights to IO, appointed DHS permanent custodian
 
of IO, and ordered DHS's proposed permanent plan dated September
 
14, 2009 (Permanent Plan).
 
On appeal, Father argues that the family court erred in
 
finding that he was not presently willing and able and it was not

reasonably foreseeable that within a reasonable period of time he
 
would become willing and able to provide IO with a safe family
 
home, even with the assistance of a service plan. He maintains
 
that (1) his completion of parenting and domestic violence
 
classes and residential treatment, and his continued
 
participation in outpatient services and therapy demonstrate that
 
he is willing to provide a safe family home for IO; (2) the court
 
prematurely permanently divested him of his parental rights
 
because, as his completion and continuation of services shows, he
 
is committed to overcoming his past; (3) the court erroneously
 
relied in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (FOF/COL)
 
on a November 27, 2009 DHS Safe Family Home Report ("the 11/27/09
 
Report" or "the report") (a) and failed to take into
 
consideration improvements he made from the time of the report to
 
the time of trial, and (b) where information in the report is
 
erroneous and/or incomplete; (4) Father was not told by DHS what
 
kind of distance he was to keep from Mother, even though it
 
apparently was a major concern of DHS. Related to these
 
arguments is Father's contention that in the court's FOF/COL,
 
Findings of Fact (FOFs) 44, 50, 53, 57, 76, 92-98, 101-105, 110,
 
and 116-17 are clearly erroneous and Conclusions of Law (COLs) 8­
10 are wrong.
 
Father asks that we vacate the Order and Permanent Plan
 
and remand the case to family court for an order that he be
 
provided additional time to demonstrate that he can care for IO
 
with minimal intervention and that DHS work with him toward
 
reunification.
 
Mother argues that the family court abused its
 
discretion by awarding DHS permanent custody of IO, when DHS
 
failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that she was
 
unwilling and unable to provide IO with a safe family home and
 
would not become able to do so in the foreseeable future, even
 
with the assistance of a service plan. Mother maintains that (1)
 
DHS failed to proffer substantial evidence showing that she had
 
not engaged in services; (2) DHS failed to provide her with
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
additional services for her co-dependency issue; (3) DHS's
 
decision to allow her to maintain custody of her newborn child,
 
JO, supports her contention that she is able and willing to
 
provide a safe and appropriate home for IO; and (4) DHS's
 
decision to file a motion for permanent custody was arbitrary and
 
capricious. Related to her contentions is her argument that FOFs
 
40, 77, 82, 85, and 87 and COLs 8-10 and 12 are erroneous. She
 
asks that we reverse the Order.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Father's points of error as follows:
 
(1) There was substantial evidence supporting the Order
 
Awarding Permanent Custody, and FOFs are 96-98 are not clearly
 
erroneous and COLs 8-10 are not wrong.
 
(a) The family court did not erroneously rely on
 
DHS's November 27, 2009 Safe Family Home Report, which was
 
neither erroneous nor incomplete. The report states that Father
 
was expected to complete his parenting and outreach programs by
 
early 2010, which he did.
 
(b) FOFs 50 and 93 are not clearly erroneous
 
because there is substantial evidence to support them.
 
(c) Father provides no evidence for the notion
 
that the family court was required to specifically find that
 
further delaying termination of his parental rights would have a
 
detrimental effect on IO, and we find none.
 
(d) FOF 94 is not clearly erroneous. It reflects 
a credibility determination on the part of the family court, 
which determination we decline to review. In re Doe Children, 
108 Hawaif i 134, 141, 117 P.3d 866, 873 (App. 2005). 
(e) The family court did not prematurely divest 
Father of his parental rights to IO, and FOF 95 is not clearly erroneous. DHS gave Father a sufficient amount of time to show 
that he could provide a safe family home for IO. Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) §§ 587-72(a), (d), and (e) (2006); see In re Doe, 
89 Hawaif i 477, 492, 974 P.2d 1067, 1082 (App. 1999).

(f) FOFs 101-02, 104-05, 110, and 117 are not
 
clearly erroneous. Father's failure to complete his services was
 
not due to any failure on the part of DHS, which made reasonable
 
efforts to reunify him with IO. Further, Father never claimed
 
prior to trial that DHS was not making appropriate referrals in a
 
timely manner.
 
(g) Father claims that FOFs 44, 53, 57, 76, 92, 
103, and 116 are clearly erroneous, but provides no discernible 
argument with regard to those FOFs. We deem his challenge to 
these findings waived. See Kahof ohanohano v. Dep't of Human 
Servs, State of Hawaii, 117 Hawaif i 262, 297 n.37, 178 P.3d 538, 
573 n.37 (2008); Hawaif i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
Rule 28(b)(7). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Mother's points of error as follows:
 
(1) FOFs 40, 77, 82, 85, and 87 are not clearly
 
erroneous, and COLs 8-10 and 12 are not wrong.
 
(a) The family court's finding that although 
Mother completed services, her co-dependency on Father 
compromised her ability to provide a safe family home for IO was 
supported by case law, statutory law, and substantial evidence in 
the record. See In re Doe, 95 Hawaif i 183, 193-94, 20 P.3d 616, 
626-27 (2001); HRS § 587-25(a) (Supp. 2006). 
(b) The family court apparently accepted DHS 
social worker Kwock's testimony at trial that DHS provided Mother sufficient services to address her co-dependency issue, and we 
decline to review that credibility determination. In re Doe 
Children, 108 Hawaif i at 141, 117 P.3d at 873. Further, Mother 
never claimed prior to trial that DHS failed to make appropriate 
referrals in a timely manner. 
(c) There was sufficient evidence to support the
 
family court's finding that Mother was unable to provide a safe

home for IO and would not be able to do so within a reasonable
 
period of time, even if after Father was released from prison on
 
July 10, 2009 there were no reports to DHS regarding IO or his
 
siblings' well-being and despite the fact that Father had
 
supervised visitation with Mother and JO.
 
(d) Mother provides no authority for the notion
 
that because DHS initially allowed her to maintain custody of JO,
 
DHS was prohibited from terminating her parental rights to IO,
 
and we find none.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Awarding Permanent
 
Custody entered on May 11, 2010 in the Family Court of the First
 Circuit is affirmed.
