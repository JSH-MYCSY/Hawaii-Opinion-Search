IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
MATTHEW S. LEWIS, aka: "ml808"; "mark", Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 08-1-1701)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Matthew S. Lewis (
Lewis) appeals
 
from an April 26, 2010 Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(Circuit Court) Judgment of Conviction and Sentence for one count
 
of Electronic Enticement of a Child in the First Degree
 
(Electronic Enticement), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) § 707-756 (Supp. 2012), and three counts of Indecent
 
Electronic Display to a Child (Indecent Electronic Display), in
 
violation of HRS § 707-759 (Supp. 2012).1
 
On appeal, Lewis contends that: (1) the Electronic 
Enticement and Indecent Electronic Display charges violate the 
"dormant" Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, as well as the free speech rights provided in the Constitutions of the State of Hawai' i and the United States; (2) Lewis's October 
22, 2008 statement given to two Honolulu Police Department (HPD) 
detectives, while Lewis was in custody, was involuntarily 
obtained and without proper warning under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966); (3) Lewis should have been allowed to present

expert opinion evidence regarding his polygraph results; (4) the 
Circuit Court erred in concluding that there was sufficient evidence to sustain Lewis's October 28, 2008 Indictment; (5) the Circuit Court abused its discretion in allowing the State of Hawai'i (State) to present evidence regarding certain videos, 
screen captures, and chats; and (6) there was insufficient evidence to support Lewis's Electronic Enticement conviction. We affirm. I. BACKGROUND
 A. The Alleged Actions Leading to Lewis's Arrest
 On September 5, 2008, Lewis, a 33-year-old man who used
 
the screen name "ml808," was on his computer in an internet chat
 room
2 where he purportedly met Shanna Lee, who used the screen
 
name "shoyubunnie" (Shanna Lee or "shoyubunnie"). Shanna Lee,
 
however, was a persona created by HPD detective Sandi Fujitani
 
(Fujitani), who was assigned to investigate internet crimes
 
against children. During the September 5, 2008 internet
 
conversation, "shoyubunnie" represented herself as a 14-year-old
 girl who lived in Pearl City and attended Sacred Hearts Academy. 
On October 13, 2008, Lewis again chatted online with
 
"shoyubunnie," and they primarily discussed their respective
 sexual experience levels and the physical characteristics of
 Shanna (again including the fact that she was only 14). Lewis
 then invited "shoyubunnie" to view his web camera, and he
 proceeded to expose his genitals and masturbated live over the
 internet. During this time, the two engaged in a brief,
 sexually-explicit conversation. Lewis did not reveal his face in
 this session. 
Lewis also exposed himself and masturbated to
 
"shoyubunnie" on October 15, 2008, while having a sexually-
explicit conversation in the online chat room. Again, Lewis did
 not expose his face. Afterwards, Lewis suggested that they meet
 "now," although they eventually agreed to meet later that night
 
2
 The particular chat room was on the website Yahoo, located under
the "romance" section and with Hawai' i as its location. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at Zippy's. In order to arrange the meeting at a Zippy's
 
restaurant, Detective Gary Sunada (Sunada) called Lewis while
 
posing as "shoyubunnie." The two confirmed that they would meet
 
at Zippy's "around nine-thirty, nine-forty five," and that Lewis
 would be wearing a "t-shirt and black pants" and would be
 "probably [driving] a white Toyota." Around 9:53 p.m., Lewis
 told "shoyubunnie" that he was "leaving now" and that it would
 take approximately 20 minutes to get to the Zippy's. 
During this time, HPD detectives Paul Lucas (Lucas) and
 
Randall Platt (Platt) were assigned to observe Lewis's residence.
 
Around 10:05 p.m., Lucas observed someone enter a black Mazda,
 
which was registered to Lewis, parked in front of the residence
 and leave the premises. The two officers followed the vehicle
 until it turned into the Zippy's parking lot around 10:30 p.m. 
Lewis slowly drove around the restaurant, looking inside, but
 never exited his vehicle or went in; after circling the entire
 lot, Lewis left. Later that night, he sent a message to
 "shoyubunnie" about waiting and not seeing her at the Zippy's
 restaurant. Fujitani, as "shoyubunnie," responded, saying that
 she was inside the restaurant. 
On October 20, 2008, Lewis again exposed himself and
 
masturbated through his web camera while chatting with
 "shoyubunnie". This time, however, Lewis briefly revealed his
 face, and Fujitani was then able to match his face from the web
 camera with his driver's license picture (thereby obtaining a
 positive identification).
 
Lewis was arrested on October 22, 2008. Following his
 
arrest, at approximately 6:03 p.m., he was questioned by Fujitani
 and Sunada at the HPD's Central Receiving Division. Before
 questioning, Fujitani and Sunada apprised Lewis of his Miranda
 rights. As discussed further herein, Lewis indicated that he
 understood English, was not on any medication, understood his
 right to an attorney, and confirmed that he was not
 forced/coerced in any way to give a statement. Lewis then agreed
 to talk to the officers, confirming various facts including: (1)
 he chatted with "shoyubunnie" as "ml808" and exposed himself (and
 
3
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
masturbated) over his web camera; (2) he had arranged a meeting
 
with "shoyubunnie" and drove around the Zippy's parking lot at
 the time they were supposed to meet; and (3) he "might" have had
 sex with Shanna if she showed up (it was supposedly a "twenty­five percent possibility," according to Lewis). 
At no point during the interrogation did Lewis ask to
 
stop the questioning; nor did he ask for an attorney's presence. 
When Fujitani was through with the questioning, she asked Lewis
 if "everything you told us tonight was voluntar[y], no one
 coerced you, forced you or threatened you in any way to make a
 statement to [the officers]?" Lewis answered "No, ma'am." 
B. The Indictment
 On October 28, 2008, a Grand Jury Indictment was
 
presented and filed, charging Lewis with one count of Electronic
 Enticement (Count I) and three counts of Indecent Electronic
 
Display (Counts II, III, and IV). Detective Fujitani was the
 
sole witness at the grand jury hearing. She testified that she
 
began chatting with "ml808," who identified himself as "Mark
 Louis" but was later identified as Lewis, on September 5, 2008
 under her "Shanna Lee" or "shoyubunnie" persona. The Grand Jury
 was also informed of the instances in which Lewis exposed himself
 to "shoyubunnie" through his web camera, as well as the attempted
 October 15, 2008 meeting. Fujitani described that Lewis's
 vehicle 
entered through the Ewa-most driveway, . . . slowly drove past the
front of the Zippy's, that would be like the drive-in area, and
then . . . proceeded Kokohead through the parking lot, turned
around, made a right turn, turned back driving towards the
restaurant again, and then proceeded to circle the whole
restaurant before driving in front of the restaurant near the
drive-in area a second time, again slowly driving past, and then
it exited the middle driveway onto South King Street. 
Finally, Fujitani recounted Lewis's interrogation
 
following his arrest on October 22, 2008. 
C. The Circuit Court Proceedings
 
On February 26, 2009, Lewis filed Defendant's Motion to
 
Suppress Statement. In the motion, Lewis argued that, although
 he was afforded his Miranda warnings, his statement was
 involuntarily given because he was "made to believe that if he
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
did give a statement to law enforcement personnel he would not be
 
prosecuted and would be released from custody." Lewis testified
 that he was "scared" and "tired" when he was in the interrogation
 room. He also stated that he was hesitant to participate at
 first, but that he believed that his cooperation would allow him
 to go home.
 
On May 18, 2009, the Circuit Court issued its Findings
 
of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Defendant's Motion
 to Suppress Statement. Its rationale for the decision was based
 on the fact that Fujitani and Sunada read Lewis his rights and
 that neither of them promised him that giving a statement would
 allow him to go home or that he would not be charged. The court
 did find that Lewis was "frightened" and "tired from work and
 possibly not getting his maximum hours of sleep earlier that
 week." Lewis conceded that he read and understood his rights at
 the time and that he understood that he could stop answering
 questions at any point in the interview. In light of these
 facts, the Circuit Court concluded that Lewis was properly warned
 of his constitutional rights and that, based on the totality of
 the circumstances, Lewis's statements were voluntary.
 
On July 6, 2009, Lewis filed Defendant's Motion to
 
Dismiss Count I of the Indictment Filed October 28, 2008, Based
 on Insufficient Evidence. Lewis argued that "no evidence was
 adduced before the grand jury that [he] 'intentionally or
 knowingly travel[ed] to the agreed upon meeting place at the
 agreed upon meeting time . . . .'" A hearing on the motion was
 held on July 28, 2009, and the Circuit Court concluded that there
 was sufficient evidence to support the October 28, 2008
 Indictment, based on Fujitani's grand jury testimony. 
On September 2, 2009, the Circuit Court filed its
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying
 Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count I of the Indictment Filed
 October 28, 2008, Based on Insufficient Evidence. In its order,
 the Circuit Court determined that the facts presented to the
 Grand Jury "could lead a person of ordinary caution or prudence
 to believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion of
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the guilt of the accused," citing State v. Ontai, 84 Hawai' i 56, 
63, 929 P.2d 69, 76 (1996). Therefore, the Circuit Court 
concluded that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the Indictment. 
On July 6, 2009, Lewis also filed Defendant's Motion To
 
Admit Expert Opinion Evidence Regarding Polygraph Results and for
 Evidentiary Hearing (Polygraph Motion). In the motion, Lewis
 
sought to introduce evidence related to a polygraph test
 
administered by Certified Polygraph Examiner William Gillespie
 (Gillespie). Gillespie was to testify that Lewis answered "no"
 
to two questions during a polygraph examination: (1) "Have you
 
ever had sexual contact with any minor you met on the internet?";
 and (2) "Of the minors you communicated with on the internet[,]
 have you ever had physical sexual contact with any of them?" 
At a July 28, 2009 hearing on the Polygraph Motion, the 
Circuit Court denied the motion, citing State v. Okamura, 78 Hawai'i 383, 894 P.2d 80 (1995) and Doe v. Doe, 120 Hawai' i 149, 
202 P.3d 610 (App. 2009). The court reasoned that those cases 
held that polygraph results are inadmissable at trial, whether 
offered by the State or a defendant. On August 31, 2009, the Circuit Court filed its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Admit Expert Opinion Evidence Regarding Polygraph Results and for Evidentiary Hearing, ruling based on the same grounds articulated at the July 28, 2009 hearing. 
On October 30, 2009, Lewis filed a Motion to Dismiss 
for Violations of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii and the Constitution of the United States. Lewis argued that HRS §§ 707­756 and 707-759 are unconstitutional because they violate the First Amendment (free speech rights) and Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 (the Commerce Clause) of the United States Constitution, as well as Article I, Section 4 of the Hawai' i Constitution (free 
speech rights). Following arguments on the December 7, 2009 motion, the Circuit Court denied Lewis's motion on both Commerce Clause and free speech grounds. On May 24, 2010, the court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Denying Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Violations of the
 
Constitution of the State of Hawaii and the Constitution of the
 United States.
 
Before trial, on February 17, 2010, Lewis pled guilty
 
to all three counts of Indecent Electronic Display. After
 
3
Lewis's plea, the State sought to introduce Camtasia  videos of
Lewis exposing himself and masturbating through his web camera. 
In support, the State argued that the videos were necessary to
 prove that Lewis had the intent to commit a sexual offense, as is
 required by HRS § 707-756. The State also posited that the
 Camtasia video from October 20, 2008 was particularly important
 because, at the conclusion of that recording, Lewis's face
 appears, and this was used to help positively identify him as
 "ml808." Lewis argued that the State had sufficient evidence
 without the Camtasia videos and that the videos were more
 prejudicial than probative. 
The Circuit Court considered the arguments and ruled
 
that the Camtasia videos were admissible under the Hawaii Rules
 of Evidence (HRE) because they were relevant to the Electronic
 
Enticement charge, they went to the issue of Lewis's sexual
 
intent with "Shanna," they helped to positively identify Lewis,
 and they would corroborate what was occurring in the text of the
 chat. The court also noted that it would limit the prejudicial
 impact of the recordings by issuing cautionary instructions to
 prevent the jury from considering the Camtasia videos for
 improper purposes, directing the jury to only consider the videos
 for the purpose of determining Lewis's state of mind.
 
The jury ultimately found Lewis guilty of the
 
Electronic Enticement charge. On April 26, 2010, the Circuit
 Court entered a Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, sentencing
 Lewis to ten years in prison. Lewis timely filed a notice of
 appeal.

II. POINTS OF ERROR
 
Lewis raises six points of error on appeal, arguing
 
that the Circuit Court erred:
 
(1) in concluding that the charge of Electronic 
Enticement of a Child in the First Degree, pursuant to HRS 
§ 707-756, and the three charges of Indecent Electronic Display to a Child, pursuant to HRS § 707-759, do not violate Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 4 of the Hawai' i Constitution, and the First Amendment of the 
United States Constitution; 
(2) in concluding that Lewis's statement to two HPD
 
detectives on October 22, 2008 was given pursuant to proper
 warning under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) and was
 voluntarily given;
 
(3) in denying Lewis the opportunity to admit expert
 
opinion evidence regarding polygraph results and an evidentiary
 hearing;
 
(4) in concluding that there was sufficient evidence to
 
sustain Count I of Lewis's Indictment, the Electronic Enticement
 charge;
 
(5) in abusing its discretion by allowing the State to
 
present evidence regarding the Camtasia videos, screen captures,
 and chats; and
 
(6) because there was insufficient evidence to support
 
Lewis's Electronic Enticement conviction. 
III. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
The appellate court reviews questions of constitutional
 
law de novo under the 'right/wrong' standard. See, e.g., State
 
v. Fields, 115 Hawai' i 503, 511, 168 P.3d 955, 963 (2007). Every 
duly-enacted statute is presumptively constitutional, and the party challenging the statute must carry a heavy burden to overcome this presumption. State v. Gaylord, 78 Hawai' i 127, 
137, 890 P.2d 1167, 1177 (1995). Whenever possible, a penal statute will be read narrowly and in such a manner as to preserve the statute's constitutionality. Id. at 137-38, 890 P.2d at 
1177-78. 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has stated the following 
regarding sufficiency of evidence to support an indictment: 
A grand jury indictment must be based on probable
cause. Probable cause is established by a state of facts as
would lead a person of ordinary caution or prudence to
believe and conscientiously entertain a strong suspicion of
the guilt of the accused. The evidence to support an
indictment need not be sufficient to support a conviction.
In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to establish
probable cause before the grand jury, every legitimate
inference that may be drawn from the evidence must be drawn
in favor of the indictment and neither the trial court nor
 the appellate court on review may substitute its judgment as
to the weight of the evidence for that of the Grand Jury.
 
State v. Ontai, 84 Hawai' i 56, 63, 929 P.2d 69, 76 (1996) 
(citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted); see 
State v. Yip, 92 Hawai' i 98, 105, 987 P.2d 996, 1003 (App. 1999). 
The appellate court applies "two different standards of 
review in addressing evidentiary issues. Evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion, unless application of the rule admits of only one correct result, in which case review is under the right/wrong standard." State v. Ortiz, 91 Hawai' i 181, 189, 
981 P.2d 1127, 1135 (1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Regarding evidentiary rulings on "admissibility based upon relevance, under [HRE] Rules 401 and 402, the proper standard of appellate review is the right/wrong standard." However, "[e]videntiary decisions based on HRE Rule 403, which require a judgment call on the part of the trial court, are reviewed for an abuse of discretion." State v. Staley, 91 
Hawai'i 275, 281, 982 P.2d 904, 910 (1999) (citations, internal 
quotation marks, and some original brackets omitted). "The trial court abuses its discretion when it clearly exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." State v. 
Plichta, 116 Hawai' i 200, 214, 172 P.3d 512, 526 (2007) (citation 
and internal quotation marks omitted). 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has stated the following 
regarding sufficient evidence to support a conviction on appeal: 
. . . 
The test on appeal is not whether guilt is
established beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was
substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the trierof fact. Indeed, even if it could be said in a bench trial 
9
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the conviction is against the weight of the evidence,
as long as there is substantial evidence to support the
requisite findings for conviction, the trial court will be
affirmed.
 
"Substantial evidence" as to every material element of
the offense charged is credible evidence which is of
sufficient quality and probative value to enable a person of
reasonable caution to support a conclusion. And as trier of
 fact, the trial judge is free to make all reasonable and
rational inferences under the facts in evidence, including
circumstantial evidence.
 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007) (citation and brackets omitted).
 
IV.	 DISCUSSION
 
A.	 Lewis's Constitutional Challenges
 1 .	 The Dormant Commerce Clause
 
Lewis challenges the constitutionality of both HRS
 
§§ 707-756 and 707-759 on "dormant" Commerce Clause grounds. 
Although Lewis addresses the statutes collectively, we will
 address each in turn. HRS § 707-756 provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 707-756 Electronic enticement of a child in the
first degree.  (1) Any person who, using a computer or any
other electronic device:
 
(a) Intentionally or knowingly communicates: 
(i)	 With a minor known by the person to be
under the age of eighteen years;
(ii)	 With another person, in reckless disregard
of the risk that the other person is under
the age of eighteen years, and the other
person is under the age of eighteen years;
or 
(iii) With another person who represents that
person to be under the age of eighteen
years; 
(b)	 With the intent to promote or facilitate the
commission of a felony:
 
(i)	 That is a murder in the first or second
 
degree;
(ii)	 That is a class A felony; or
(iii) That is another covered offense as defined
in section 846E-1,
agrees to meet with the minor, or with another
person who represents that person to be a minor
under the age of eighteen years; and
 
(c)	 Intentionally or knowingly travels to the agreed
upon meeting place at the agreed upon meeting
time, 
10
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is guilty of electronic enticement of a child in the first
degree.
 
HRS § 707-756(1) (Supp. 2012).
 
As this court recently discussed in State v. Alangcas,
 
No. 30109, 2013 WL 6230085, at *13 (Haw. Ct. App. Nov. 29, 2013),
 
[t]he U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to
regulate commerce "with foreign Nations, and among the
several States, and with the Indian tribes." U.S. Const.
 art. I, § 8, cl. 3. However, "[e]ven if Congress has not
specifically regulated an incident of interstate commerce,
state laws that unduly burden interstate commerce and
thereby impede free private trade in the national
marketplace generally violate the so-called dormant commerce
clause" of the U.S. Constitution. People v. Hsu, 99 Cal.
Rptr. 2d 184, 190 (Cal. Ct. App. 2000) (citing General
Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 287 (1997)). The
 framework for determining whether a state statute violates
the dormant Commerce Clause is set forth in Pike v. Bruce
 Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 (1970): 
Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate
a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on
interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be
upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is
clearly excessive in relation to the putative local
benefits. If a legitimate local purpose is found,
then the question becomes one of degree. And the
 extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of
 course depend on the nature of the local interest
involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well
with a lesser impact on interstate activities. 
Id. at 142 (internal citation omitted). 
Like the defendant in Alangcas, Lewis relies on 
American Libraries Ass'n v. Pataki, 969 F. Supp. 160 (S.D.N.Y.
 
1997), to argue that HRS § 707-756 violates the "dormant"
 Commerce Clause because: (1) HRS § 707-756 regulates conduct
 occurring wholly outside of Hawai' i; (2) HRS § 707-756 places 
burdens on interstate commerce that outweigh the local benefits
 derived from the statute; and (3) statutes regulating the
 internet, like HRS § 707-756, demand uniform, national regulation
 as opposed to a patchwork of inconsistent state regulations.
4
 
Based on the authorities cited and the analysis set forth in
 Alangcas, we reject Lewis's argument that HRS § 707-759 violates 
4
 The defendant in Alangcas also raised a fourth argument, not
 
raised by Lewis here, that HRS § 707-756 is not a "luring" statute and outlaws
conduct/communications that are not harmful to minors.
 
11
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the "dormant" Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
See Alangcas, 2013 WL 6230085, at *13-17.
 
Although Lewis makes no distinct argument with respect
 
to HRS § 707-759, the analysis is not identical. HRS § 707-759
 provides, in relevant part:
 
§ 707-759 Indecent electronic display to a child.
(1) Any person who intentionally masturbates or
intentionally exposes the genitals in a lewd or lascivious
manner live over a computer online service, internet
service, or local bulletin board service and who knows or
should know or has reason to believe that the transmission
 is viewed on a computer or other electronic device by:
 
(a)	 A minor known by the person to be under the age
of eighteen years;
 
(b)	 Another person, in reckless disregard of the
risk that the other person is under the age of
eighteen years, and the other person is under
the age of eighteen years; or
 
(c) 	Another person who represents that person to be
under the age of eighteen years,
 
is guilty of indecent electronic display to a child.
 
. . . . 
HRS § 707-759 (Supp. 2012).
 
Unlike HRS § 707-756, HRS § 707-759 does not have an
 
explicit "enticement" or "luring" element; rather, it prohibits
 
the intentional masturbation or exposure of one's genitals "in a
 lewd or lascivious manner live over" the internet to a "minor."
5
 
See HRS § 707-759(1). Thus, HRS § 707-759 is most aptly viewed
 
6	 7
as akin to an "indecent exposure,"  "open lewdness,"  or a
 
5 As stated therein, HRS § 707-759 applies if the person viewing the
transmission is known to be a minor, the actor engages in the prohibited
conduct in reckless disregard of the risk that the (minor) viewer is a minor,
or if the viewer represents to the actor that he or she is a minor. HRS
 § 707-759(1)(a), (b), & (c).
 
6
 HRS § 707-734 (1993) is Hawaii's "indecent exposure" statute, and
it states that "[a] person commits the offense of indecent exposure if, the
person intentionally exposes the person's genitals to a person to whom the
person is not married under circumstances in which the actor's conduct is
likely to cause affront." 
7
 HRS § 712-1217 (1993) is Hawaii's "open lewdness" statute, and it
states that "[a] person commits the offense of open lewdness if in a public
place the person does any lewd act which is likely to be observed by others
who would be affronted or alarmed." 
12

"sexual assault" (fourth degree)  statute, all of which appear to
be constitutionally permissible under the State's expansive
 police powers. See generally W. H. Greenwell, Ltd. v. Dep't of
 
Land & Natural Res., 50 Haw. 207, 209, 436 P.2d 527, 528 (1968)
 (stating that although "not absolute," the state's "police power
 is one of the least limitable of governmental powers"). HRS §
 707-759 is most like these types of criminal statutes because it
 is primarily concerned with suppressing criminal conduct (namely,
 "live" lewd acts directed at a "minor"). We see little to
 distinguish HRS § 707-759's prohibitions from those involving,
 say, a situation in which someone masturbates or commits a lewd
 act on the lawn outside of the window of a child's house. 
Additionally, it is difficult to conceive of any legitimate
 commerce that is burdened by penalizing this behavior. See 15B
 
A
M. JUR. 2D Computers and the Internet § 5 (showing that states
 
have upheld statutes that involve the valid exercise of police
 power and that regulate the "conduct of individuals who intended
 to use the Internet to endanger the welfare of children"). The
 effect on interstate commerce, if any, is merely "incidental,"
 and pales in comparison to the legitimate, local law enforcement
 purpose of protecting the State's minors from these sorts of
 "live" criminal acts (i.e., masturbation and lewd exposure). See
 
Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). 
Accordingly, we conclude that HRS § 707-759 does not violate the
 "dormant" Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

 HRS § 707-733 (1993) is entitled "Sexual assault in the fourth
degree," and it includes the following:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in
the fourth degree if:
. . . 
(b) 	The person knowingly exposes the person's
genitals to another person under circumstances
in which the actor's conduct is likely to alarm
the other person or put the other person in fear
of bodily injury[.]

2 . Free Speech
 
Lewis's entire argument that HRS §§ 706-756 and 707-759
 
are constitutionally infirm because they violate free speech
 
protections is as follows:
 
HRS § 707-756 and HRS § 707-759 potentially suppresses [sic]
a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional
right to send and receive over the Internet. Therefore, HRS
§ 707-756 and HRS § 707-759 represent unconstitutional
intrusions into freedom of speech as guaranteed by Article
I, Section 4, of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii and
the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United
 States.
 
This argument is without merit. Lewis has not met the
 
applicable burden to establish a constitutional defect. See
 
State v. Mallan, 86 Hawai' i 440, 446, 950 P.2d 178, 184 (1998). 
The First Amendment is applicable to the states through
 
the Fourteenth Amendment, and it provides that "Congress shall
 
make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." U.S. Const.
 amend. I.; Edwards v. S. Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235 (1963)
 (stating that "[i]t has long been established that these First
 Amendment freedoms are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment from
 invasion by the States"). Similarly, the Hawai' i Constitution 
guarantees that "[n]o law shall be enacted . . . abridging the
 freedom of speech." Haw. Const. art. I, § 4. 
These constitutional guarantees are not absolute,
 
however. The Hawai' i Supreme Court has held: 
The First Amendment to the United States Constitution
 
does not protect speech which is part of a course of
criminal conduct. [Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336
U.S. 490, 498 (1949); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 563
(1965)]. In Giboney, the United States Supreme Court
 stated:
 
It rarely has been suggested that the
constitutional freedom for speech and press
extends its immunity to speech or writing used
as an integral part of conduct in violation of a
valid criminal statute. We reject the
contention now.
 
[Giboney, 336 U.S. at 498].
 
State v. Pegouskie, 107 Hawai' i 360, 369, 113 P.3d 811, 820 (App. 
2005). 
Additionally, speech related to illegal sexual activity
 
with minors has not been held to require First Amendment
 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
protection where it is an element of the crime addressed by the
 
statute. United States v. Meek, 366 F.3d 705, 721 (9th Cir.
 
2004) (citation omitted) ("The inducement of minors to engage in
 illegal sexual activity enjoys no First Amendment protection.");
 United States v. Bailey, 228 F.3d 637, 639 (6th Cir. 2000)
 ("[T]he Defendant simply does not have a First Amendment right to
 attempt to persuade minors to engage in illegal sex acts.");
 People v. Williams, 551 N.E.2d 631, 634 (Ill. 1990) ("[W]e
 conclude that the luring or attempted luring of a child into an
 automobile for a criminal purpose is in no way protected by the
 first amendment."). In other words, although the "ideas
 contained in the communication may be protected speech," when the
 statutes involve "purposely" engaging in "sexual advances
 directed at a child," the expression "may be regulated by
 criminalizing the conduct." See M. Megan McCune, Virtual
 
Lollipops and Lost Puppies: How Far Can States Go to Protect
 Minors Through the Use of Internet Luring Laws, 14 CommLaw
 Conspectus 503, 534 (2006). 
Looking to HRS §§ 707-756 and 707-759, it is clear that 
the speech impinged upon is an essential element of the crimes challenged. To violate HRS § 707-756, one must intentionally or knowingly communicate with a "minor," agree to meet the "minor" with the intent to promote or facilitate a felony, and then intentionally or knowingly travel to the agreed upon place at the agreed upon time. See HRS § 707-756 (emphasis added). 
Similarly, to violate HRS §707-759, an actor must intentionally masturbate/expose his or her genitals in a "lewd or lascivious manner" through a "live [communication] over" the internet to a "minor." See HRS § 707-759(1) (emphasis added). To the extent 
that these statutes involve an aspect of speech, the speech is inextricably intertwined with the validly criminalized conduct in the statutes. Thus, because the speech is an "integral part of conduct in violation of a valid criminal statute," HRS §§ 707-756 and 707-759 do not violate either the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article I, Section 4 of the Hawai' i 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Constitution. See Pegouskie, 107 Hawai' i at 369, 113 P.3d at 
820; see also New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 761-62 (1982). 
B. Lewis's Statement to the Police
 
Lewis next argues that the statements he made to
 
Detectives Fujitani and Sunada were "involuntarily obtained and
 without proper warning under Miranda v. Arizona." "[B]efore
 reference is made at trial to statements made by the accused
 
9
during custodial interrogation,  the prosecutor must firstdemonstrate that certain safeguards were taken before the accused was questioned, i.e., Miranda warnings." State v. Rippe, 119 
Hawai'i 15, 22, 193 P.3d 1215, 1222 (App. 2008) (brackets and 
internal quotation marks omitted; footnote added) (citing State v. Ketchum, 97 Hawai' i 107, 116, 34 P.3d 1006, 1015 (2001)). A 
proper Miranda warning requires that the accused is informed that they have a right to remain silent, that anything said could be used against them in court, that they have a right to the presence of an attorney, and that an attorney will be appointed for them if they are unable to afford one. Ketchum, 97 Hawai' i 
at 116, 34 P.3d at 1016. "After a defendant has been adequately apprised of his Miranda rights, he may waive effectuation of these rights provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently." State v. Gella, 92 Hawai' i 135, 143, 988 
P.2d 200, 208 (1999) (brackets, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). 
In the present case, Lewis was apprised of his
 
constitutional rights pursuant to a proper Miranda warning. 
Prior to being informed of his rights, Lewis acknowledged that he
 had a high school education, could read and write English, and
 that he was making the statement of his own free will. 
Thereafter, he was informed of his Miranda rights and was shown a
 form entitled "Warning Persons Being Interrogated Of Their
 Constitutional Rights," which he was instructed to read as it was
 
9
 It is undisputed that Lewis was subject to a custodial
interrogation, which was defined Miranda as "questioning initiated by law
enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise
deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way." Miranda v.
 
Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966).
 
16
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
read aloud to him. The form had the rights explicitly stated on
 
it. Lewis indicated that he wanted to waive those rights, both
 orally and by signing the form. Although he was initially
 hesitant in responding to whether he wanted an attorney, stating
 that he had "never gone through anything . . . like this before,"
 he eventually declined one, with no prompting or suggestion by
 Fujitani or Sunada regarding whether he should or should not
 proceed without an attorney present. He was also informed that
 he could stop the questioning at "any time." Accordingly, the
 Circuit Court did not err by concluding that Lewis was properly
 warned of his Miranda rights and that he voluntarily, knowingly,
 and intelligently waived those rights.
 
Lewis nevertheless maintains that his October 22, 2008 
statement was not voluntary because his confession that he "might have had sex with [Shanna] . . . was a product of fatigue from having worked all day, apprehension and the compelled belief that the interrogation would stop if he answered the questions." Lewis relies, in part, on HRS § 621-26 (1993), which provides that: "No confession shall be received in evidence unless it is first made to appear to the judge before whom the case is being tried that the confession was in fact voluntarily made." The Hawai'i Supreme Court examined this voluntariness requirement in 
State v. Kelekolio: 
Under the fifth amendment to the United States
 
Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Hawaii
Constitution, [n]o person shall . . . be compelled in any
criminal case to be a witness against himself or
herself. . . . The constitutional right against self-
incrimination prevents the prosecution's use of a
defendant's extrajudicial admissions of guilt where such
admissions are the product of coercion. . . . The burden is
on the prosecution to show that the statement was
voluntarily given and not the product of coercion. The
 burden is particularly heavy in cases where the defendant is
under arrest.
 
74 Haw. 479, 501-02, 849 P.2d 58, 69 (1993) (footnotes,
 
citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).
 
Lewis's argument that his statement was involuntarily
 
obtained is unavailing. Before Lewis began giving his statement,
 he was explicitly informed that he could stop answering questions
 at any time. The Circuit Court found that "[a]t all times . . .
 
17
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[Lewis] sounded rational, clear, and responsive" and "indicat[ed] 
that he understood the questions and his mind was clear." Additionally, the Circuit Court specifically found that Lewis was not promised that he could go home or that he would not be charged if he made a statement. Lewis acknowledged this fact in his interview with police, stating "no" to the questions about whether he was promised anything in exchange for making a statement and whether anyone coerced him in any manner. Finally, 
regarding the fatigue assertion, although a defendant's mental 
and physical condition can be considered in deciding the voluntariness of custodial statements, doing so here does not warrant a conclusion of involuntariness. See In re Doe, 90 
Hawai'i 246, 254, 978 P.2d 684, 692 (1999) (citation omitted). 
Here, like in State v. Kelekolio, Lewis's alleged lack of sleep did not render his statements involuntary. See Kelekolio, 74 
Haw. at 503-04, 849 P.2d at 69-70. Lewis's lack of sleep was not the product of any "impermissible scheme on the part of the police to lower his resistance or render him susceptible to improper suggestion." In addition, the alleged tiredness also appeared to have no bearing on the interrogation at all. Id. at 
504, 849 P.2d at 70. Lewis in fact stated "I'm fine," in response to a question about whether he felt well enough to sit in the interrogation room and tell his version of events. In light of the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the prosecution carried its burden to establish that Lewis's statements were voluntarily given, not the product of coercion, and properly obtained in compliance with Miranda. 
C. The Polygraph Evidence
 Lewis contends that the Circuit Court erred by refusing 
to allow expert testimony regarding a polygraph examination that Lewis took. It is well-established in Hawai' i that polygraph 
results are not admissible, whether offered by the prosecution or defense. State v. Okumura, 78 Hawai' i 383, 397, 894 P.2d 80, 94 
(1995) (citing State v. Antone, 62 Haw. 346, 357, 615 P.2d 101, 109 (1980)); see also State v. Chang, 46 Haw. 22, 31, 374 P.2d 5, 11 (1962)); State v. Kun Ok Cho, No. 28349, (App. March 12, 2009) 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(SDO). The rationale behind this rule is that polygraph tests
 
are not considered reliable. Chang, 46 Haw. at 31, 374 P.2d at
 
11.
 
Despite this long-standing rule, Lewis contends that
 
"[t]he constitutional right to present evidence overrides the
 exclusionary rule barring polygraph tests." The United States
 Supreme Court squarely addressed this argument in United States
 v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303 (1998). In Scheffer, the defendant was
 a volunteer informant on drug investigations for the Air Force
 Office of Special Investigations. Id. at 305. As part of his
 
duty as an informant, Scheffer was asked to take a drug test and,
 shortly thereafter, a polygraph examination. Id. at 305-06. 
Scheffer's drug test revealed the presence of methamphetamine,
 while his polygraph test "indicated no deception" when he denied
 using drugs since joining the Air Force. Id. at 306. At his
 
trial by general court-martial for using methamphetamine, he was
 not allowed to introduce evidence related to the polygraph test,
 pursuant to Military Rule of Evidence 707.
10 Id. at 306-07. 
Scheffer was convicted on all counts. Id. at 307.
 
Before the Supreme Court, Scheffer argued that the
 
preclusion of polygraph evidence infringed upon his right to
 present a defense. Id. at 307 n.3. The Court began by stating
 
that a defendant's right to present evidence is subject to
 reasonable restrictions, which include other legitimate interests
 in the criminal trial process. Id. at 308. Noting the lack of
 
scientific consensus regarding the reliability of polygraph
 evidence, the Court ruled that a per se bar on polygraph evidence
 in military trials advanced the legitimate interest in barring
 unreliable evidence. Id. at 310-12. The Court also stated that
 
the ban served the interests of preserving the jury's core
 
10
 Military Rule of Evidence 707 stated the following:
 
(a) Not withstanding any other provision of law, the results
of a polygraph examination, the opinion of a polygraph
examiner, or any reference to an offer to take, failure to
take, or taking of a polygraph examination, shall not be
admitted into evidence.
 
Scheffer, 523 U.S. at 306-07 (internal quotation marks omitted).
 
19
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
function of making credibility determinations and avoiding 
litigation over issues other than the guilt or innocence of the accused and that a ban on polygraph evidence did not implicate any significant interest of the accused.
11 Id. at 312-17. In 
accordance with this precedent, Hawai' i's bar on polygraph 
evidence does not override Lewis's constitutional right to present evidence, and the Circuit Court did not err by excluding Lewis's polygraph evidence in this case. 
D. The Indictment
 We reject Lewis's argument that there was insufficient 
evidence to sustain Count I of the Indictment. As set forth above in conjunction with the Applicable Standards of Review, "neither the trial court nor the appellate court on review may substitute its judgment as to the weight of the evidence for that of the Grand Jury." Ontai, 84 Hawai' i at 63, 929 P.2d at 76 
(citations and brackets omitted); see also State v. Yip, 92 Hawai'i 98, 105, 987 P.2d 996, 1003 (App. 1999). Every 
legitimate inference from the evidence must be drawn in favor of the Indictment and the probable cause standard is applicable. Ontai, 84 Hawai' i at 63, 929 P.2d at 76. 
Count I of the Indictment charged Lewis with Electronic
 
Enticement, in violation of HRS § 707-756, and therefore required
 evidence establishing probable cause with respect to following
 elements: (1) intentionally or knowingly communicate through a
 computer or any electronic device with a person known or thought
 to be under the age of eighteen years; (2) agree to meet with the
 minor with the intent to promote/facilitate a felony; and (3)
 intentionally or knowingly travel to the agreed upon meeting
 place at the agreed upon time. See HRS § 707-756(1)(a), (b), &
 
(c). 
11
 Hawai'i courts have also recognized these general interests. See 
State v. Klafta, 73 Haw. 109, 117, 831 P.2d 512, 517 (1992) (citing State v.
Batangan, 71 Haw. 552, 799 P.2d 48 (1990)) (noting that expert testimonyregarding credibility is inadmissible); State v. Suan, 121 Hawai' i 169, 176,
214 P.3d 1159, 1166 (App. 2009) (holding that a prosecutor's statement wasimproper because "it injected issues broader than [the defendant's] guilt orinnocence under the controlling law into the case"). 
20
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Lewis argues that there was no evidence adduced before
 
the Grand Jury that Lewis intentionally or knowingly traveled to
 
the agreed upon meeting place at the agreed upon time, pursuant
 to HRS § 707-756(1)(c). Although acknowledging the evidence that
 he traveled to the Zippy's parking lot, drove around, and exited,
 Lewis argues that he did not stop, exit his vehicle, and actually
 consummate "travel[ing] to the agreed upon meeting place." 
We reject this argument. In addition to the foregoing,
 
Fujitani testified to the Grand Jury that, the next day, Lewis
 chatted with "Shanna" and stated, "he had gone there, he didn't
 see me, so he had gone home." Fujitani also testified to the
 Grand Jury that, in his post-arrest interview statement, Lewis
 admitted, inter alia, "that he was the person that showed up at
 
th
[] Zippy's to meet Shanna on October 15 , 2008 in the black
Mazda." We conclude that, taking "every legitimate inference
 that may be drawn from the evidence" in favor of the Indictment,
 there was sufficient evidence presented to the Grand Jury to
 support Count I of the Indictment, including that he
 intentionally or knowingly traveled to the agreed upon meeting
 place. Accordingly, the Circuit Court did not err in denying
 Lewis's motion to dismiss Count I.
 
E. The Camtasia Recordings, Screen Captures, and Chats
 Lewis argues that the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion in allowing the State to present the Camtasia videos,
 screen captures, and chats. In particular, Lewis objects to the
 court allowing the jury to view the Camtasia videos showing him
 masturbating through his web camera. Lewis argues that the
 Circuit Court should have excluded the Camtasia videos pursuant
 
12 13 14
to HRE Rules 401,  403,  and 404(b).
 
12
 HRE Rule 401 defines "relevant evidence" as "evidence having any
tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the
determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be
without the evidence."
 
13
 HRE Rule 403 provides:
 
Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its
probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of
(continued...)
 
21
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Lewis contends that, although constituting material
 
evidence for the Indecent Electronic Display charges, to which he
 
had pled guilty, the Camtasia videos were irrelevant to the
 Electronic Enticement charge. However, as the Circuit Court
 found, the videos were relevant pursuant to HRE Rule 401, and
 therefore admissible pursuant to HRE Rules 402 and 404(b),
 because they were relevant to the issue of whether Lewis
 possessed the requisite "intent to promote or facilitate the
 commission of a felony," in this case, sexual assault. See HRS §
 
707-756(1)(b).
15
 
Lewis also maintains that, when the State published the
 
visual recordings of him masturbating with his erect penis on a
 
13(...continued)
unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the
jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or
needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
 
14	 HRE Rule 404(b) states, in relevant part:
 
Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not
admissible to prove the character of a person in order to
show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be
admissible where such evidence is probative of another fact
that is of consequence to the determination of the action,
such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation,
plan, knowledge, identity, modus operandi, or absence of
mistake or accident. . . . 
15 HRS § 707-756(1)(b) includes reference to a felony that is a
"covered offense as defined in section 846E-1." The "covered offenses" in
 section 846E-1 include the crimes of sexual assault in the first and third
 degree. See HRS § 846E-1 (Supp. 2012). 
HRS § 707-730 states, in relevant part, the following: 
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in
the first degree if:
. . . .
 (c) 	The person knowingly engages in sexual
penetration with a person who is at least
fourteen years old but less than sixteen years
old[.]
 
HRS § 707-732 states, in relevant part, the following: 
(1) A person commits the offense of sexual assault in
the third degree if:
. . . .
 (c) 	The person knowingly engages in sexual contact
with a person who is at least fourteen years old
but less than sixteen years old or causes the
minor to have sexual contact with the person[.]
 
22
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
screen in the courtroom, the prejudicial effect was significant, 
immeasurable, irreversible, and far outweighed the relevancy and probative value. We recognize the prejudicial nature of such evidence, but the Circuit Court's decision that the probative value here, on the issue of Lewis's intent to commit a felony, outweighed that prejudice does not clearly exceed the bounds of reason or disregard rules or principles of law or practice to the the substantial detriment of a party litigant. The State had the heavy burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, inter alia, that Lewis intended to communicate with a "minor", with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony. We cannot conclude that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in weighing the prejudicial effect and the probative value under the circumstances of this case. See State v. McKnight, 128 Hawai' i 
328, 335-36, 289 P.3d 964, 971-72 (App. 2012) (holding that probative value of live images of defendant masturbating during internet chats with undercover agent posing as 15-year-old girl was not substantially outweighed by danger of unfair prejudice), cert. granted, SCWC-28901, 2012 WL 1951392 (Haw. May 31, 2012); State v. Sakata, No. 29157, (App. Aug. 26, 2009) (SDO) (holding that trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting video of Sakata exposing himself, doing "more than just him standing there and dropping his pants," via webcam). 
F. Sufficiency of the Evidence to Sustain Conviction
 Lewis challenges the sufficiency of the evidence 
supporting the jury's conclusion that he "intentionally or knowingly travel[ed] to the agreed upon meeting place at the agreed upon time," as required under HRS § 707-756(1)(c). He argues that he "did not stop, exit his vehicle and actually consummate traveling to the agreed upon meeting place" because he only "entered the parking lot, drove around Zippy's and exited." As stated above, the Hawai' i Supreme Court has held: 
The test on appeal is not whether guilt is established
beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial
evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of
fact. . . . "Substantial evidence" . . . is credible
 evidence which is of sufficient quality and probative value
to enable a person of reasonable caution to support a
conclusion.

Matavale, 115 Hawai' i at 157-58, 166 P.3d at 330-31 (citation and 
brackets omitted). 
In the present case, there was sufficient evidence to
 
support the conviction because there was "substantial evidence"
 
to support the jury's conclusion that Lewis "intentionally or
 knowingly travel[ed] to the agreed upon meeting place at the
 agreed upon time." Although the evidence shows that Lewis did
 not fully stop or exit his vehicle upon reaching Zippy's, there
 is no evidence that Lewis and "Shanna" specifically agreed to
 meet inside the Zippy's restaurant, but rather, merely agreed to
 meet at "Zippy's." In addition, trial evidence included, inter
 alia, Lewis's "chat" statements that he had been "there waiting,"
 but did not see "Shanna," so he went home. We conclude, in light
 of all of the evidence presented at trial, there was substantial
 evidence to support Lewis's Electronic Enticement conviction.
