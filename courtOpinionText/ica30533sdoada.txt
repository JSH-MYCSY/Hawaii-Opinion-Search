NO. 30533
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
DOUGLAS MILLER, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR. NO. 07-1-0309(4))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Douglas Miller (Miller) appeals
 
from the judgment filed on May 4, 2010, in the Family Court of
 
the Second Circuit (circuit court).1 After a resentencing
 
hearing, the circuit court sentenced Miller to one year of
 probation, subject to several conditions, including a two-day
 
jail term and payment of restitution in an amount to be
 
determined by his probation officer.
 
On appeal, Miller argues that the circuit court (1)
 
plainly, reversibly erred by denying his motion for Deferred
 
Acceptance of No Contest (DANC) plea (DANC motion) without
 
providing him with notice of or an opportunity to deny, explain,
 
or rebut the information the court relied on; and (2) abused its
 
discretion in denying his DANC motion by setting the Hawaii
 
2
 Revised Statutes (HRS) Chapter 853 "deferral bar so high that it
effectively precluded Miller, and every other defendant appearing
 
before the court, from obtaining a DANC plea."

After a careful review of the record, the arguments 
made by the parties and the relevant legal authority, we conclude 
Miller's points are without merit. The circuit court did not 
abuse its discretion in denying Miller's DANC motion. State v. 
Klie, 116 Hawai' i 519, 521-22, 174 P.3d 358, 360-61 (2007). The 
circuit court based its decision on the facts of the case as 
reflected in the record and Miller had ample opportunity, in his 
memorandum in support of his DANC motion and argument prior to 
the circuit court's ruling, to carry his burden of persuasion on 
the DANC motion. See State v. Cucinotta, 502 A.2d 89, 92 (N.J. 
Super. Ct. Law Div. 1984) (burden on defendant to present information for pretrial intervention program); State v. 
Dendurent, 669 P.2d 361, 363 (Or. Ct. App. 1983) (defendant has 
burden of proving that he or she was not disqualified from 
diversion program); Commonwealth v. Sohnleitner, 884 A.2d 307, 
314 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2005) (burden on defendant to show 
prosecutor's denial of admission to diversion program was for 
prohibited reasons); State v. Oakes, 269 S.W.3d 574, 577 (Tenn. 
Crim. App. 2006) (defendant has the burden to demonstrate his or 
her eligibility and suitability for pretrial diversion); Rawson 
v. State, 900 P.2d 1136, 1139 (Wyo. 1995) (defendant has burden
 
of showing eligibility for first-time-offender probation
 
statute).
 
Therefore, the May 4, 2010 judgment of the Family Court
 
of the Second Circuit is affirmed.
