NO. 30541
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
THE ESTATE OF ELMER R. MITCHELL, aka ELMER ROSS MITCHELL
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(PROBATE NO. 08-1-0217)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not 
have jurisdiction over the appeal that Petitioner-Appellant 
Calvin Mitchell has asserted from the "Order Denying Petition for Accounting from Personal Representative Susan G. Miyasato, Removal of Susan G. Miyasato as Personal Representative, Appointment of Successor Personal Representative, Order Directing Successor Personal Representative to Create the Jane Mitchell Trust and Disqualify Personal Representative Susan G. Miyasato 
from Being Appointed Trustee of the Jane Mitchell Trust, and Surcharge Filed December 2, 2009" (the April 28, 2010 Order), because the April 28, 2010 Order is an interlocutory order that is not independently appealable pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009) and Rule 34 of the Hawai
'i Probate Rules (HPR). NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
HRS § 641-1(a) is the law that authorizes appeals from
 
a probate court's final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals
 
under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by
 the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). The Supreme Court of
 Hawai
'i has promulgated HPR Rule 34, which generally requires the 
entry of a judgment for an appeal:
 
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS
 
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of
the court. Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
 
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
 
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed
pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions.
 
HPR Rule 34 (emphases added).
 
The probate court has not reduced the April 28, 2010
 
Order to a separate judgment. The probate court has not
 
certified the April 28, 2010 Order in the manner provided by HRCP
 Rule 54(b). The probate court has not certified the April 28,
 2010 Order for an interlocutory appeal in accordance with HRS
 § 641-1(b). Therefore, the April 28, 2010 Order is not eligible
 for appellate review pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) and HPR Rule 34.

Although common law exceptions to the final judgment 
requirement exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the 
Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine, the April 28, 2010 Order does not satisfy all of the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). 
Absent an appealable judgment or an appealable order,
 
this appeal is premature and we lack appellate jurisdiction. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
