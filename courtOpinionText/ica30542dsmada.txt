KATHLEEN K.R. BATES,
Trustee of the George R. Rodrigues, Jr., Trust,
Plaintiff-Appellee, 
v.
 
ROBERT S. RODRIGUES and TOVE RODRIGUES,
Defendants-Appellants
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 3RC 08-1-0233H)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendants-Appellants
 
Robert S. Rodrigues and Tove Rodrigues (the Rodrigues Appellants)
 have asserted from the Honorable Melvin H. Fujino's May 12, 2010
 third amended judgment for possession, because, under the
 
circumstances of this case, the Rodrigues Appellants' appeal
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
appears to be untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai» i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
Pursuant to Hawai» i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) 
(1993 & Supp. 2009), 
appeals are allowed in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts. In district court cases , a judgment includes any
order from which an appeal lies. A final order means an
 
order ending the proceeding, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. When a written judgment, order, or decree
ends the litigation by fully deciding all rights and
liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing further to be
adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is final and
appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142 , 91 Hawai» i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The requirement of a separate judgment under Rule 58 of the Hawai» i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright , 76 
Hawai» i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994), is "not applicable to district 
court cases." Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142 , 91 Hawai» i at 427, 
984 P.2d at 1253. In the instant case, however, it appears that the district court has not yet entered a judgment, order or decree that resolves all of the parties' claims, because the Plaintiff-Appellee s claim for breach of lease, seeking money damages, has not yet been resolved. 
An exception to the general rule requiring a final 
judgment, order, or decree exists pursuant to the United States Supreme Court's holding in Forgay v. Conrad , 47 U.S. 201 (1848). 
The Supreme Court of Hawai» i has acknowledged the Forgay  doctrine 
as "allow[ing] an appellant to immediately appeal a judgment for execution upon property, even if all claims of the parties have not been finally resolved." Ciesla v. Reddish , 78 Hawai» i 18, 
-2­ NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995). Under the Forgay doctrine, an 
appellate court "ha[s] jurisdiction to consider appeals from 
judgments which [1] require immediate execution of a command that property be delivered to the appellant s adversary, and [2] the losing party would be subjected to irreparable injury if appellate review had to wait the final outcome of the litigation." Id. (citations, internal quotation marks omitted; 
some brackets omitted, some brackets added). Thus, in Ciesla v. 
Reddish, where a district court had entered a judgment for possession that did not, however, resolve an outstanding 
counterclaim in the case, the supreme court held that "the judgment for possession was a judgment immediately appealable 
under the Forgay  doctrine." Id. However, as explained below, 
the appeal by the Rodrigues Appellants is untimely under the 
Forgay doctrine. 
The Rodrigues Appellants purport to be appealing from
 
the May 12, 2010 third amended judgment for possession, but the
 district court has actually entered four separate judgments for
 
possession:
 
(1) an April 17, 2009 judgment for possession that
does not  identify the subject real estate
(April 17, 2009 judgment);
 
(2) a December 24, 2009 first amended judgment for
possession that appears to refer to the wrong
address of the subject real estate parcel
(December 24, 2009 judgment);
 
(3) a January 11, 2010 second amended judgment for
possession that refers to the correct address of
 
the subject real estate parcel (January 11, 2010
judgment); and
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(4) a May 12, 2010 third amended judgment for
possession that refers to the correct address of
 
the subject real estate parcel (May 12, 2010
judgment).
 
The Supreme Court of Hawai» i has explained that, when a party 
appeals from a case in which a trial court has entered multiple
 
judgments,
 
[t]he general rule is that where a judgment is amended in a
material and substantial respect, the time within which an
appeal from such determination may be taken begins to run
from the date of the amendment, although where the amendment
relates only to the correction of a clerical error, it does
not affect the time allowed for appeal.
 
Poe v. Hawaii Labor Relations Bd. , 98 Hawai» i 416, 418, 49 P.3d 
382, 384 (2002) (citation, internal quotation marks, and ellipsis
 
points omitted; emphasis added).
 
If the amendment of a final judgment or decree for the
purpose of correcting a clerical error either materially
alters rights or obligations determined by the prior
judgment or decree or creates a right of appeal where one
did not exist before, the time for appeal should be measured
from the entry of the amended judgment. If, however, the
 
amendment has neither of these results, but instead makes
changes in the prior judgment which have no adverse effect
upon those rights or obligations or the parties  right to
appeal, the entry of the amended judgment will not postpone
the time within which an appeal must be taken from the
original decree.
 
Id. (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted;
 
emphases added).
 
It appears that the January 11, 2010 judgment amended
 
both the April 17, 2009 judgment and the December 24, 2009
 
judgment in a material and substantial respect in that the
 
January 11, 2010 judgment refers to the correct  address of the
 
subject real estate parcel. Therefore, the January 11, 2010
 
judgment appears to have triggered a new thirty-day time period
 
under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for filing a notice of appeal.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In contrast, however, the May 12, 2010 judgment does
 
not amend the January 11, 2010 judgment in a material and
 
substantial respect. The substantive adjudication in the May 12,
 
2010 judgment is identical  to the substantive adjudication in the
 
January 11, 2010 judgment, including that both of these judgments
 refer to the correct address of the subject real estate parcel. 
Because the May 12, 2010 judgment did not amend the January 11,
 2010 judgment in a material and substantial respect, the May 12,
 2010 judgment did not trigger a new thirty-day time period under
 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) within which a party had to assert an appeal. 
A timely appeal had to have been filed within thirty days of the
 January 11, 2010 judgment.
 
The Rodrigues Appellants did not  file their May 28,
 
2010 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the
 January 11, 2010 judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required for a
 
timely appeal. The Rodrigues Appellants did not file any post-
judgment motions that would have tolled the thirty-day period
 pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Therefore, the Rodrigues
 
Appellants' appeal is untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1). The
 failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
 
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 
appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 discretion. Bacon v. Karlin , 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is
 authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in
 Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Accordingly,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. 30542 is dismissed
 
for lack of jurisdiction.
