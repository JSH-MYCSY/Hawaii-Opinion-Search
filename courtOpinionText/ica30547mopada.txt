February 25, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 
(circuit court). The circuit court entered judgment in favor of
 Defendants-Appellees/Cross-Appellants The University of Hawai' i 
(University), Marla Berry, Rosanne Harrigan, Ping An Li, Samuel

On appeal, Boyd contends the circuit court erred in
 
dismissing his May 16, 2008 Complaint (Complaint). 
In UH's cross-appeal, it contends the circuit court 
erred in issuing its May 4, 2010 "Order Granting in Part and 
Denying in Part Plaintiff's Motion to Disallow Taxation of Costs 
in Favor of Defendants, Filed March 22, 2010" when the court 
reduced the award of costs to UH from $2,522.77 to $720.27 
without providing justification as required by Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure Rule 54(d) and Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 607-9 (1993). 
I. BACKGROUND
 
In Boyd's Complaint against UH, he alleged violations 
of article I, sections 4 and 5 of the Hawai' i Constitution and 
HRS § 378-61 [sic] (1993), negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, gross 
negligence, and respondent superior. 
On March 10, 2009, UH filed their Motion to Dismiss
 
Boyd's Complaint. On August 10, 2009, the circuit court filed
 
its "Order Granting In Part and Denying In Part [UH's] Motion to
 
Dismiss, Filed March 10, 2009" (August 10, 2009 Order), in which
 
the court dismissed Counts 1 through 5 and Count 7 and partially
 
dismissed Count 6. 
On September 30, 2009, UH filed their "Renewed Motion
 
to Clarify or Revise Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part
 
Their Motion to Dismiss Filed March 10, 2009, Filed August 10,
 
2009, or, in the Alternative, for Dismissal of All Remaining
 
Claims" (Renewed Motion). On December 22, 2009, the circuit
 
court granted UH's Renewed Motion and dismissed all of Boyd's
 
remaining claims. On February 25, 2010, the circuit court
 
entered its Final Judgment against Boyd on all claims in his
 
Complaint. 
On March 2, 2010, UH filed a Notice of Taxation of
 
Costs, asking for costs of $2,522.77. On March 10, 2010, the
 
circuit court granted costs in favor of UH in the amount of
 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
$2,522.77. Boyd filed his "Motion to Disallow Taxation of Costs
 
in Favor of Defendants" on March 22, 2010. The circuit court
 
filed its "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiff's
 
Motion to Disallow Taxation of Costs in Favor of Defendants,
 
Filed March 22, 2010" on May 4 2010, reducing the award from
 
$2,522.77 to 720.27. 
Boyd and UH each timely appealed. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A.	 Motion to Dismiss
 
A trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss is
reviewed de novo. The court must accept plaintiff's
allegations as true and view them in the light most
favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is proper only if it
appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of
facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle him
or her to relief. 
Wong v. Cayetano, 111 Hawai' i 462, 476, 143 P.3d 1, 15 (2006) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
B.	 Award of Costs
 
The award of a taxable cost is within the discretion
 
of the circuit court and will not be disturbed absent a
 clear abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs
 when the circuit court has clearly exceeded the bounds of
reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice
to the substantial detriment of a party litigant.
 
Pulawa v. GTE Hawaiian Tel, 112 Hawai' i 3, 10-11, 143 P.3d 1205, 
1212-13 (2006) (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets 
omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 The circuit court did not err in finding that
Counts 1 through 5 and a portion of Count 6 of
Boyd's Complaint are barred by the statute of
limitations.
 
Boyd contends the circuit court erred in finding that
 
Counts 1 through 5 and part of Count 6 were barred by the statute
 
of limitations. Boyd alleged violations of the Whistleblowers'
 
Protection Act, HRS § 378-61 et seq., under Counts 1 through 3,
 
and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
under Counts 4 and 5.2 Under the statute of limitations for the
 
Whistleblowers' Protection Act, "[a] person who alleges a
 
violation of this [act] may bring a civil action for appropriate
 
injunctive relief, or actual damages, or both within two years
 
after the occurrence of the alleged violation of this part." HRS
 
§ 378-63(a) (2010 Supp.). Similarly, "[a] tort claim against the
 
State shall be forever barred unless action is begun within two
 
years after the claim accrues." HRS § 662-4 (1993). In
 
accordance with these statutory provisions, the circuit court
 
held in its August 10, 2009 Order:
 
FOR COUNTS [1] THROUGH [6], the Court will DISMISS
alleged events that occurred outside the two year statute of
limitation set forth in the State Tort Liability Act, HRS
§ 662-4, and the Whistleblowers' Protection Act, HRS § 378­63. The Complaint was filed May 16, 2008, therefore, [Boyd]
will be statutorily barred from bringing an action based
upon any acts alleged that occurred prior to May 16, 2006.
[3]
 
The circuit court went on to hold that Counts 1 through 5
 
described actions alleged to have taken place in or before 2005
 
and dismissed those counts for alleging actions outside the
 
statute of limitations. The circuit court partially dismissed
 
Count 6 by limiting that count to paragraphs 97 through 101 of
 
the Complaint, as such paragraphs contained actions alleged to
 
have occurred in 2007 and 2008. Id.
 
Boyd essentially argues that the actions alleged in
 
Count 6 that are not barred by the statute of limitations apply
 
to all counts -- not only Count 6. Yet Boyd points to nothing in
 
the Complaint that would indicate the actions alleged in Count 6
 
would also apply to Counts 1 through 5. As the actions alleged
 
2
 In his Complaint, Boyd alleged violations of "Section 1 Articles
§§ 4 & 5 of the Hawaii State Constitution"; however, such provisions do not
actually exist. It appears that Boyd is referring to article 1, section 4
(Freedom of Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly and Petition) and article 1,
section 5 (Due Process and Equal Protection) of the Hawaii Constitution. Boyd
does not, however, indicate in his Complaint on which specific actions the
constitutional claims are based, nor specifically which constitutional rights
were harmed by the actions of UH. The circuit court seemingly ignored the
constitutional claims as they are not addressed in the August 10, 2009 Order.
3
 Paragraphs 61 through 63 of Counts 1 through 3 alleged certain
actions of UH during September 2006 and 2008, but these allegations do not
constitute a cause of action.
 
4
    
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
in Counts 1 through 5 and a portion of the actions alleged in
 
Count 6 occurred prior to May 16, 2006, the circuit court did not
 
err in holding that those claims are barred by the applicable
 
statutes of limitations.
 
B.	 The circuit court did not err in holding that the
continuing tort exception does not apply.
 
Boyd contends the continuing tort exception should be
 
applied to Counts 1 through 5 and the portions of Count 6
 
dismissed by the circuit court in its August 10, 2009 Order. 
The circuit court held that Boyd's allegations "do not fall
 
within the continuing tort exception with regard to the tolling
 
of the statute of limitations on the tort claims." 
"[A] continuing tort is a tortuous act that occurs so 
repeatedly that it can be termed 'continuous,' such that one may 
say that the tortuous conduct has not yet ceased. Accordingly, 
the statute of limitations cannot run, because the tortuous 
conduct is ongoing." Anderson v. State, 88 Hawai' i 241, 248, 965 
P.2d 783, 790 (App. 1998). 
Boyd did not allege the type of conduct that the 
continuing tort exception is intended to encompass, nor did Boyd allege the continuing tort doctrine at all in his Complaint. As 
the circuit court correctly stated in the August 10, 2009 Order, 
"the circumstances alleged in this Complaint are factually 
distinguishable from those prior Hawai' i cases; what we have 
here, more closely, is a series of separate and distinguishable acts that have been alleged throughout the numerous paragraphs of 
the [C]omplaint." 
C.	 The circuit court did not err in holding that the
remaining portions of Count 6 did not meet the
requirements for negligent infliction of emotional
distress.
 
The circuit court dismissed the remaining claims under
 
Count 6 in its order granting UH's Renewed Motion, holding that
 
the allegations were not actionable as pled and that Boyd had not
 
properly alleged a physical injury as was required for negligent
 
5
  
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
infliction of emotional distress under HRS § 663-8.9 (1993). A 
claim under HRS § 663-8.9 "requires a predicate physical injury 
to the [claimant alleging negligent infliction of emotional 
distress] before he or she may recover damages for negligent 
infliction of emotional distress." Doe Parents No. 1 v. State of 
Hawai'i, Dep't of Educ., 100 Hawai' i 34, 69, 58 P.3d 545, 580 
(2002). 
Boyd contends the circuit court erred in dismissing the
 
remaining portions of Count 6 because he properly alleged a
 
physical injury in the Complaint by claiming to have suffered
 
from "memory loss." However, Boyd points to no authority that
 
would indicate memory loss is considered a physical injury under
 
HRS § 663-8.9.
 
Boyd also alleged in Count 6 that UH was grossly
 
negligent. However, Boyd's factual allegations do not support
 
that claim.
 
D.	 The circuit court did not err in holding that it
lacked jurisdiction over Count 7.
 
In the order granting UH's Renewed Motion, the circuit
 
court dismissed Count 7 as it applied to Ostrander and Syrmos
 
acting in their official capacity, citing to HRS § 304A-108 (2007
 
Repl.), which states that "all claims arising out of the acts or
 
omissions of the university or . . . its employees . . . may be
 
brought only pursuant to this section and only against the
 
university." It is clear from the plain language of this statute
 
that only University itself may be sued for acts or omissions of
 
its employees acting in their official capacities.
 
Based on sovereign immunity, the circuit court then 
dismissed Count 7 as it applied to University. Id. "[I]t is 
well established that the State's liability is limited by its 
sovereign immunity, except where there has been a 'clear 
relinquishment' of immunity and the State has consented to be 
sued." Taylor-Rice v. State of Hawai' i, 105 Hawai' i 104, 109, 94 
6
    
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
P.3d 659, 664 (2004) (citation omitted); see also HRS § 662-15(4)
 
(Supp. 2010).
 
In his Complaint, Boyd specifically alleged under
 
Count 7 that the conduct of Ostrander and Syrmos, acting in their
 
official capacity, as well as the conduct of University, was the
 
cause of harm to Boyd. Boyd presents no credible argument why
 
the circuit court's dismissal of Count 7 should be reversed.
 
E.	 The circuit court partially erred in reducing the
award of costs from $2,522.77 to $720.27.
 
On cross-appeal, UH contends the circuit court erred in
 
reducing the award of costs from $2,522.77 to $720.27. In Boyd's
 
Motion to Disallow Taxation Of Costs in Favor of [UH], he argued
 
that the original award of $2,522.77 included improper awards for
 
messenger service fees, out-sourced copying charges, costs
 
associated with Boyd's rule 11 motion, non-detailed in-house
 
copying costs, and certain costs involving transcripts. The
 
circuit court partially granted this motion and accordingly
 
reduced the original award of $2,522.77 to $720.27.
 
HRS § 607-9 allows for an award of costs for 
"intrastate travel expenses for witnesses and counsel, expenses 
for deposition transcript originals and copies, and other 
incidental expenses, including copying costs, intrastate long 
distance telephone charges, and postage, sworn to by an attorney 
or a party, and deemed reasonable by the court." Boyd correctly 
argued that costs associated with messenger and delivery services 
are generally not considered taxable costs. "[E]xcept in the 
rare circumstance where the need in a particular case is 
extraordinary in its volume or nature, the cost of this function 
. . . is properly treated as overhead. . . . [M]essenger fees are 
not taxable costs[.]" Kikuchi v. Brown, 110 Hawai' i 204, 213, 
130 P.3d 1069, 1078 (App. 2006). As no rare or extraordinary circumstances were present, the circuit court correctly reduced 
the original award cost by the $415.97 originally awarded for 
messenger and delivery services. 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Similarly, Boyd correctly argued that $256.47 in out­
sourced copying and $180.15 in unjustified in-house copying was
 
improper. While HRS § 607-9 does allow for necessary copies to
 
be considered as taxable costs, UH fails to provide any
 
description for the out-sourced copies and for $180.15 in in­
house copies described only as "June 2008 copies" and "July 2008
 
copies." Without further description or explanation, these
 
copies do not meet the requirements for taxable costs, and the
 
circuit court correctly removed these items from the cost award. 
Boyd also argued that all costs ($325.83) associated
 
with his Rule 11 Sanctions Motion should be disallowed. In its
 
January 15, 2010 order denying Boyd's motion for Rule 11
 
sanctions, the circuit court specifically denied UH's request for
 
attorney's fees and costs associated with the Rule 11 motion. .
 
Therefore, the circuit court properly denied the requested costs
 
of $325.83.
 
The circuit court erred, however, when it reduced the 
original award amount by the $624.08 in transcript costs 
associated with Boyd's motion for injunctive relief. Boyd argued 
that "transcripts as Court-Reporter fees" were appropriate only 
when such transcripts were necessary and that UH provided no 
description or justification for the transcripts they obtained 
concerning Boyd's motion for injunctive relief. A nearly 
identical argument was dismissed in Wong v. Takeuchi, 88 Hawai' i 
46, 53, 961 P.2d 611, 618 (1998). In Wong, appellant argued that the appellee offered 
no explanation as to why these depositions and/or the costs
they incurred were necessary. Deposition costs are only
taxable if they are necessary and therefore, [appellant's]
failure to show why these depositions and/or the costs they
incurred were necessary make it clear that it would be an
abuse of discretion for this court to tax them to
 [appellee.]
 
Id. The court rejected this argument, stating that 
when costs are awardable to a prevailing party under HRCP
Rule 54(d) and a particular taxable cost is allowed by
statute or precedent, then actual disbursements for this
purpose are presumptively reasonable. The adverse party has
the burden of challenging the reasonableness of a particular
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
cost request. In the absence of a challenge to a particular
request, it is not an abuse of discretion for a court to
award the cost requested as presumptively reasonable.
 
Id. at 53-54, 961 P.2d 618-19 (footnote omitted). Because the
 
costs associated with transcripts and court reporter fees are
 
presumptively reasonable, the burden was on Boyd to demonstrate
 
that the cost was not reasonable. Therefore, Boyd's argument
 
that UH failed to justify the reasonableness of the costs of the
 
transcripts associated with Boyd's motion for injunctive relief
 
fails.
 
The circuit court's reduction of the original award of
 
$2,522.77 was proper with the exception of the $624.08 reduction
 
for the cost of transcripts. Therefore, the proper award should
 
have been $1,344.35. 
IV. CONCLUSION
 
The Final Judgment filed on February 25, 2010 in the
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed. The "Order
 
Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiff's Motion to
 
Disallow Taxation of Costs in Favor of Defendants, Filed
 
March 22, 2010" filed on May 4, 2010 is vacated, and this case is
 
remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent
 
with this opinion.
