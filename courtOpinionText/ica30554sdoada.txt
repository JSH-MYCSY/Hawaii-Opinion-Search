SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Quintin Kiili, Patricia
 
Nishiyama, and George Kiili ("Kiili Defendants"), appearing pro
 
se, appeal from the May 12, 2010 Final Rule 54(b) Judgment and
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Decree, entered in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee Huelo Hui, LP
 
("Huelo Hui") by the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
 ("Circuit Court").
1
 
On appeal of this quiet title action relating to three
 
parcels of real property on the Island of Maui, the Kiili
 Defendants argue that the Circuit Court erred in granting the
 Huelo Hui's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment ("MPSJ") because
 (1) the warranty deed dated July 24, 1878 ("July 1878 Deed"),
 purporting to convey Makue's, Haole's and Kanehoalani's rights in
 a portion of Royal Patent Grant 1142 ("Grant 1142"), is invalid,
 because Haole's and Kanehoalani's rights did not vest until
 probate of Keoho's estate, and execution of the deed predated
 probate; (2) on October 8, 1878, Makue testified that he and his
 brother Keoho "purchased 126 acres from Lot," but there is no
 declaration in Probate Number 883 from Makue that he and Keoho
 sold their 126 acres of land to T. Akanaliilii; (3) the July 1878
 Deed is a "fraudulent deed" because it does not have "two seals
 on it"; (4) according to a July 24, 1879 mortgage deed from,
 among others, T. Akanaliilii to C. Brewer & Co., "Akanaliilii &
 Co. claimed that the land that was mortgage[d] to C. Brewer from
 Akanaliilii & Co. is land leased from [Makue]"; and (5) it is
 unclear whether Haole and Kanehoalani were daughters or nieces of
 Keoho. The Kiili Defendants also argue that the Circuit Court
 erred by (6) "not granting appellant[s] rights to a Jury Trial." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
2
submitted by the parties,  and having given due consideration to
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve the Kiili Defendants' points of error as follows:
 
(1)
 The Kiili Defendants claim to be the heirs of
 
Makue, not of Keoho, Haole, or Kanehoalani. Even if any of the

 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.

 The Kiili Defendants' opening brief does not comply with many of
the provisions of Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 28(b).
Nevertheless, "this court observes a policy of affording pro se litigants the
opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible."
Hawaiian Props., Ltd. v. Tauala, 125 Hawai' i 176, 181 n.6, 254 P.3d 487, 492
n.6 (App. 2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore,
we address the Kiili Defendants' arguments to the extent that we can discern
them.
 
2
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
signatories of the July 1878 Deed lacked conveyable title on the
 
date of execution, this would not invalidate the deed or Makue's
 conveyance. The July 1878 Deed is, as the Kiili Defendants
 recognize, a warranty deed. "A grantor who executes a deed
 purporting to convey land to which he has no title or to which he
 has a defective title at the time of the conveyance will not be
 permitted, when he afterward acquires a good title to the land,
 to claim in opposition to his deed as against the grantee or any
 person claiming title under him." 23 Am. Jur. 2d Deeds § 277
 (2002). Thus, "[a] deed may have the effect of passing to the
 grantee a title subsequently acquired by the grantor." Id.;
 
Raines v. Walker, 77 Va. 92, 95 (1883) ("If a person conveys land
 with general warranty, and does not own it at the time, but
 afterwards acquires the same land, such acquisition enures to the
 benefit of the grantee."). 
In other words, a warranty deed executed by a party
 
without title is not necessarily invalid or void. Thus, whether
 
Haole or Kanehoalani had acquired title to the land prior to
 
execution of the July 1878 Deed is not determinative of the
 validity of their or Makue's conveyance.  Therefore, the Kiili
 
Defendants' argument is without merit.
 
Even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that 
actual ownership at the time a related warranty deed is executed 
matters, the Kiili Defendants fail to show that, under Hawai' i 
Kingdom law, administration was required for title in real property to vest in heirs of an intestate ancestor. Under Hawaiian Kingdom law, in fact, an intestate ancestor's rights and title to real property descended to his or her heirs at the time of death. See Kaleleonalani v. Comm'rs. of Crown Lands, 6 Haw. 
454, 457–58 (Haw. Kingdom 1884). This is consistent with Hawai' i 
common law. See Serion v. Thornton, 104 Hawai' i 79, 87 n.12, 85 
P.3d 186, 194 n.12 (App. 2004); see also 26B C.J.S. Descent and Distribution § 83 (2011). 
Section 1455 of the Kingdom Civil Code merely provided
 
that one heir may elect to buy the other heir's interests to the
 land through a legal mechanism that would force the other heirs
 to convey their interests in exchange for a price set by a
 
3
     NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
probate court's appraisal. See Compiled Laws of the Hawaiian
 
Kingdom § 1455, at 77–78 (1884). Section 1455 does not indicate
 
that title passes to heirs only upon administration. 
Furthermore, there is no indication that any of Keoho's heirs
 ever elected to use this procedure.
 
The Kiili Defendants' failed to present a dispute of
 
material fact and, therefore, did not establish that the Circuit
 Court erred by granting the MPSJ.
 
(2) The Kiili Defendants' do not identify where in the
 
record they raised the issue involved in their second point of
 error to the Circuit Court. As such, the point may be
 disregarded. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(4). In addition, our
 independent review finds that the issue was raised only after the
 Circuit Court had already orally granted the MPSJ on April 9,
 2010. As such, the point is waived. H
AW. REV. STAT. § 641-2
 
(Supp. 2012) ("The appellate court . . . need not consider a
 point that was not presented in the trial court in an appropriate
 manner."); Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). 
In any event, the argument is without merit as well. 
Huelo Hui demonstrated that Makue, along with and Keoho's heirs
 and their husbands, executed the July 1878 Deed. The Kiili
 Defendants fail to present any reason why Makue was required to
 testify in the probate proceedings that he had sold a portion of
 his interest in Grant 1142 in order to prevent that conveyance
 from being infirm.
 
(3) The Kiili Defendants cite to no statute requiring
 
that a valid deed bear two seals, instead citing to section 1254
 of the civil code, which states that: "It shall not be lawful to
 record any conveyance, or other instrument required by law to be
 stamped, unless the same shall have been previously impressed
 with the Royal stamp, as provided in Section 422(a)." See
 
Compiled Laws of the Hawaiian Kingdom § 1254, at 406 (emphasis
 added). Section 1254 simply made explicit that an unstamped
 document could not lawfully be recorded in the Bureau of
 Conveyances. 
Contrary to the Kiili Defendants' claim, according to 
Hawai'i Kingdom case law, an unstamped document was not 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
necessarily invalid. See Hilo Sugar Co. v. Mioshi, 8 Haw. 201,
 
207-08 (Haw. Kingdom 1891) ("The want of a stamp does not make
 
the contract invalid. . . . The object of the law was to obtain
 revenue for the Government."). Thus, the Kiili Defendants'
 argument that the July 1878 Deed is fraudulent because it lacks a
 stamp is without merit.
 
Furthermore, it is undisputed that the July 1878 Deed
 
was recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances. A note on the face of
 the document indicates that the deed had been "Stamped" for $2. 
Pursuant to Hawaiian Kingdom law, the Registrar of Conveyances
 would not have recorded the deed if the instrument had not been
 properly stamped. The Kiili Defendants present no basis upon
 which the Circuit Court could have concluded that the July 1878
 Deed was improperly recorded or unenforceable.
 
(4) The Kiili Defendants appear to argue that in a
 
July 24, 1879 mortgage deed, "Akanaliilii & Co. claimed that the
 land that was mortgage[d] to C. Brewer from Akanaliilii & Co. is
 land leased from MAKUE." The point of the statement is unclear
 and is therefore insufficiently presented for review on appeal. 
Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7).
 
(5) The Kiili Defendants appear to suggest that it is 
unclear whether Kanehoalani or Haole are daughters or nieces of Keoho. A review of the record does not reveal that, and Appellants do not identify for us where or when this argument was raised in the proceedings before the Circuit Court. Thus, this argument, too, is waived. Haw. Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 
Hawai'i 438, 500, 164 P.3d 696, 758 (2007).
3 
(6) Granting a motion for summary judgment makes a 
trial unnecessary where no dispute of material fact exists. See 
Haw. Prince Hotel Waikiki Corp. v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 89 Hawai'i 381, 393, 974 P.2d 21, 33 (1999). Since the Kiili 
Defendants have failed to show that the Circuit Court erred in granting the MPSJ, they cannot show that they are entitled to a jury trial. Therefore, 
3
 Furthermore, testimony given in Probate Number 883 indicates that
Kanehoalani and Haole were Keoho's children. Nevertheless, the Kiili
Defendants fail to argue how this would invalidate any of Makue's conveyances.
