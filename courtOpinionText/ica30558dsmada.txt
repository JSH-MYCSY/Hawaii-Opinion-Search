NO. 30558
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI» I 
SAMUEL COOPER, JR., Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI» I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 09-1-0005; CR. NO. 00-1-0474)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack
 
jurisdiction over the appeal that Petitioner-Appellant Samuel
 
Cooper, Jr. (Appellant), has asserted from the Honorable Karen
 S.S. Ahn's June 19, 2009 "Order Denying and Dismissing Petition 
to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner from Custody; Notice of Entry" (the June 19, 2009 order) because the appeal is untimely under Rule 40(h) of the Hawai» i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) and Rule 4(b) of the 
Hawai» i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
Pursuant to Hawai» i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-11 
(Supp. 2009) and "HRPP [Rule] 40(h), appeals from proceedings forpost-conviction relief may be made from a judgment entered in theproceeding and must be taken in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai» i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori v.

State, 79 Hawai» i 10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted). The supreme court does 
not apply the separate document rule (see Jenkins v. Cades  
Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai» i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994)) 
to special proceedings for motions for post-conviction relief pursuant to HRPP Rule 40. The June 19, 2009 order resolved all of the issues in Appellant's January 29, 2009 HRPP Rule 40 petition for post-conviction relief by denying all of the relief for which Appellant prayed, leaving nothing further to be accomplished. Therefore, the June 19, 2009 order is an appealable final order pursuant to HRS § 641-11 and HRPP Rule 40(h). 
"[P]ursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b), an appeal from an order 
denying post-conviction relief must either be filed within thirty 
days after the entry of the order denying the HRPP Rule 40 petition or, in the alternative, after the announcement but before the entry of the order." Grattafiori v. State , 79 Hawai» i 
at 13, 897 P.2d at 940. Appellant did not file his June 10, 2010 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the June 19, 2009 order, as HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) requires. Therefore, Appellant's June 10, 2010 notice of appeal from the June 19, 2009 order is not  timely. 
"In criminal cases, [the supreme court] ha[s] made 
exceptions to the requirement that notices of appeal be timely 
filed." State v. Irvine , 88 Hawai» i 404, 407, 967 P.2d 236, 239 
(1998). Specifically, the supreme court has permitted untimely 
appeals under two sets of circumstances: 
(1) [when] defense counsel has inexcusably or ineffectively
failed to pursue a defendant s appeal from a criminal
conviction in the fist instance, or (2) [when] the lower
court s decision was unannounced and no notice of the entry
of judgment was ever provided.
 
Grattafiori , 79 Hawai» i at 13-14, 897 P.2d at 940-41 (citations 
omitted). These two exceptions do not apply to the instant case 
because (1) this case is not Appellant's appeal from his criminalconviction in the first instance and (2) the record shows that 
the circuit court provided Appellant with timely notice of the  
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
June 19, 2009 order. Therefore, Appellant does not qualify for
the exceptions to the requirement that notices of appeal be
 timely filed.
  
"As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of 
the timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, . . . and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction." 
Grattafiori, 79 Hawai» i at 13, 897 P.2d at 940 
(citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in Rule 4 of these rules."). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. 30558 is dismissed
 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
