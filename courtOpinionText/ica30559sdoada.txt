IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
JOSEPH PITTS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0097)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Joseph Pitts (Pitts) appeals from
 
the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence entered May 12, 2010 in
 
1
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).  A jury
 
found Pitts guilty of attempted murder in the second degree in
 
violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) §§ 705-500 (1993),
 
707-701.5 (1993), and 706-656 (Supp. 2008) and the circuit court
 
sentenced Pitts to life imprisonment with the possibility of
 
parole.
 
On appeal, Pitts raises seven points of error that have
 
been consolidated into four issues for review. 
Pitts contends
 
the circuit court erred when it:
 
(1) denied Pitts's motion to dismiss the indictment;
 
(2) denied Pitts's request for appointment of counsel; 
1

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(3) failed to provide curative instruction regarding
 
witness testimony which included suppressed evidence; and
 
(4) failed to address claims of juror misconduct.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude this
 
appeal is without merit.
 
(1) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying Pitts's motion to dismiss his indictment.
 
On January 13, 2010, Pitts filed his Motion to Dismiss
 
Indictment on the grounds that the prosecutor failed to present
 
clearly exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. On February 3,
 
2010, the circuit court denied Pitts's motion. Pitts maintained
 
the prosecutor had a duty to present evidence that Pitts did not
 
attempt to flee the scene, that there was a lack of blood on
 
Pitts's clothing, and that the Complainant did not identify Pitts
 
when first asked to identify his attacker. 
While prosecutors must present evidence to support a
 
determination of probable cause, the prosecutor need not present
 
all the evidence that supports or refutes probable cause. State
 
v. Bell, 60 Haw. 241, 245, 589 P.2d 517, 520 (1978) overruled on 
other grounds by State v. Chong, 86 Hawai' i 282, 949 P.2d 122 
(1997). In Bell, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that "where 
evidence of a clearly exculpatory nature is known to the 
prosecution, such evidence must be presented to the grand jury." 
Bell, 60 Haw. at 245, 589 P.2d at 520 (emphasis added). 
The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 
finding the evidence did not clearly exculpate Pitts. Evidence
 
that the Complainant did not immediately identify Pitts was not
 
clearly exculpatory. The Complainant later positively identified
 
Pitts as the assailant. Pitts's cooperation with police was not
 
clearly exculpatory. And, the lack of blood on Pitts's clothing
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was not clearly exculpatory. The Complainant's blood was
 
actually found on Pitts's jacket.
 
(2) The circuit court neither abused its discretion
 
nor violated Pitts's right to counsel when it refused his request
 
for reinstatement of counsel. 
On March 1, 2010, Pitts expressed his intent to proceed
 
pro se. The circuit court informed Pitts of the risks and
 
hardships of an incarcerated defendant that attempts to proceed
 
without defense counsel and asked Pitts to fully consider the
 
ramifications before waiving his right to counsel. The circuit
 
court did not entertain Pitts's proposal, but informed him that
 
the court would recess until the following day and at such time
 
if Pitts remained steadfast in his choice to proceed pro se, the
 
circuit court would conduct the appropriate colloquy.
 
On March 2, 2010, Pitts again expressed his intent to
 
represent himself. The circuit court conducted an extensive
 
colloquy and accepted Pitts's waiver of his right to counsel. 
The circuit court appointed stand-by counsel to answer legal
 
questions Pitts might have had.
 
On March 4, 2010, Pitts expressed frustration at trying
 
to represent himself in court and requested appointment of
 
counsel. After an inquiry into Pitts's reasons for requesting
 
appointment of counsel, the circuit court asked stand-by counsel
 
if he would be willing to represent Pitts. Stand-by counsel
 
declined. The circuit court considered the late stage of the
 
trial, the likely delay in appointing counsel, and ruled that
 
Pitts must continue to represent himself.
 
At the sentencing hearing on May 12, 2010, Pitts
 
renewed his request for appointment of counsel. The circuit
 
court denied Pitts's request and imposed the mandatory sentence
 
as was prescribed by law.
 
Pitts did not challenge the validity of his waiver of
 
his right to counsel but asserted that once he sought to withdraw
 
his waiver, he was entitled to appointment of counsel. Once
 
3

Pitts waived his right to counsel, he no longer had the absolute 
right to the reinstatement of counsel. John-Charles v. Cal., 646 
F.3d 1243, 1250 (9th Cir. 2011). The circuit court exercised its discretion in rejecting Pitts's withdrawal of his waiver, taking 
into consideration factors of a prejudicial delay and disruption 
of Pitts's trial. See, e.g., State v. Christian, 88 Hawai' i 407, 
422, 967 P.2d 239, 254 (1998). 
Pitts also challenges the circuit court's ruling that
 
stand-by counsel did not have standing to present a motion on
 Pitts's behalf. This challenge is without merit. Stand-by
 
counsel was not authorized to represent Pitts. 
(3) Neither the witness's nor the prosecutor's
 
reference to "defendant" during direct questioning constituted
 
reversible error. 
Given the evidence admitted at trial, including the
 
Complainant's testimony identifying Pitts as the person that
 
stabbed him, the Complainant's blood on Pitts's jacket, and that
 
Pitts was apprehended in the nearby vicinity, any error was
 
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Kelekolio, 74
 
Haw. 479, 528, 849 P.2d 58, 80 (1993). Therefore, even though
 
the witness's statement constitutes error, such error is harmless
 
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Pitts contends the improperly elicited eyewitness 
testimony identifying Pitts constituted prosecutorial misconduct. 
"In order to determine whether the alleged prosecutorial 
misconduct reached the level of reversible error, we consider the 
nature of the alleged misconduct, the promptness or lack of a 
curative instruction, and the strength or weakness of the 
evidence against defendant." State v. Clark, 83 Hawai' i 289, 
304, 926 P.2d 194, 209 (1996) (citing State v. Agrabante, 73 Haw. 179, 198, 830 P.2d 492, 502 (1992) (citation omitted)). 
The eyewitness's utterance of "defendant" cannot be
 
attributed to any prompting by the prosecutor. When the
 
prosecutor referred to the "defendant" she corrected herself
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
immediately by rephrasing "passenger" for "defendant." Pitts did
 
not object to the prosecutor's statement, and there was no
 
curative instruction. There was substantial evidence to support
 
Pitts's conviction. The prosecutor's brief reference to
 
"defendant" did not constitute reversible error. 
(4) The jury was not precluded from examining exhibits 
during jury deliberations. See, e.g., State v. Kassebeer, 118 
Hawai'i 493, 506, 193 P.3d 409, 422 (2008). Extrajudicial 
investigation occurs when a juror considers information gathered 
outside the courtroom. See State v. Williamson, 72 Haw. 97, 807 
P.2d 593 (1991) (holding that the juror's use of a dictionary during deliberations was reversible error); Lopez v. Sears 
Roebuck & Co., 70 Haw. 562, 777 P.2d 715 (1989) (holding a 
juror's independent investigation of premises constituted 
misconduct); State v. Amorin, 58 Haw. 623, 574 P.2d 895 (1978) 
(holding that a juror's use of a dictionary constituted harmless 
error). The jury did not engage in improper extrajudicial 
investigation. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment and Conviction
 
entered May 12, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
