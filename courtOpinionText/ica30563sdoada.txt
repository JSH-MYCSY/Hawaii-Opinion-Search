APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0057)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendants-Appellants Franklin Valdez and Lynette Lou
 
Kawaikauikamakaoakopua Valdez ("Appellants"), appeal from the
 
Order Denying Ex Parte Motion for Temporary Restraining Order,
 
filed on May 17, 2010, in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit
 
(Circuit Court).1
 
Appellants' sole point of error appears to be that the
 
Circuit Court erred by denying their post-judgment Ex Parte
 
Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, filed on April 21, 2010,
 
because the Circuit Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over
 
the underlying ejectment case.2

 The Honorable Greg K. Nakamura presided.

 On February 10, 2011, this court issued an Order Granting in Part
and Denying in Part Plaintiff-Appellee RMS Residential Properties, LLC's

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve
 
Appellants' contentions as follows:
 
Appellants' argument is without merit. The Circuit 
Court has jurisdiction over civil actions and proceedings. 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ยง 603-21.5. A complaint for 
ejectment is a civil action or proceeding within the meaning of 
HRS ยง 603-21.5. Persons claiming to be citizens of the Kingdom 
of Hawai' i are subject to the laws of the State of Hawai' i, 
including the statutes providing for the jurisdiction of the circuit courts. See generally State v. Fergerstrom, 106 Hawai' i 
43, 55, 101 P.3d 652, 664 (App. 2004); State v. Lorenzo, 77 Hawai'i 219, 220, 883 P.2d 641, 642 (App. 1994); State v. Jim, 80 
Hawai'i 168, 172, 907 P.2d 754, 758 (1995). 
The Circuit Court's May 17, 2010 Order Denying Ex Parte
 
Motion for Temporary Restraining Order is affirmed.
