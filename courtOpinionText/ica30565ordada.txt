HAWAII MEDICAL SERVICE ASSOCIATION'S AUGUST 31, 2010
MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL AS MOOT, BUT WITHOUT PREJUDICE
TO THE PARTIES' FURTHER ADDRESSING MOOTNESS IN THEIR BRIEFS
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Defendant-Appellee Hawaii Medical

 
Service Association's (Appellee HMSA) August 31, 2010 motion to
 
dismiss this appeal as moot, (2) Plaintiffs-Appellants Carol A.
 Brown, M.D., and Carol A. Brown, M.D., Inc.'s (the Brown
 Appellants), September 8, 2010 memorandum in opposition to
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Appellee HMSA's August 31, 2010 motion to dismiss, (3) the
 
September 15, 2010 order granting Appellee HMSA leave to file a
 reply memorandum, (4) Appellee HMSA's September 15, 2010 reply
 memorandum in support of the August 31, 2010 motion to dismiss,
 and (5) the record, we decline at this time to rule on the issue
 of mootness, and, instead, we direct the parties to further
 address the issue of mootness in their respective appellate
 briefs.
 
Appellee HMSA argues that the Brown Appellants' appeal 
from the February 11, 2010 amended judgment is moot, because the Brown Appellants failed to assert a timely appeal directly from a January 9, 2009 order confirming the arbitration award in this matter, which was an independently appealable order pursuant to Hawai
'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-28(a)(3) (Supp. 2009). 
According to Appellee HMSA, the Brown Appellants' failure to directly appeal that order results in finality of the January 9, 2009 order confirming the arbitration award, and, thus, renders the Brown Appellants' appeal from the February 11, 2010 amended judgment moot. 
A case is moot if it has lost its character as a
 
present, live controversy of the kind that must
exist if courts are to avoid advisory opinions
on abstract propositions of law. The rule is
 one of the prudential rules of judicial self-
governance founded in concern about the proper ­and properly limited - role of the courts in a
democratic society. We have said the suit must
 remain alive throughout the course of litigation
to the moment of final appellate disposition to
escape the mootness bar. . . . Simply put, a
case is moot if the reviewing court can no
longer grant effective relief.

At this time, we decline to rule on the issue whether
 
this appeal is moot, and, instead, we direct the parties to
 
further address the issue of mootness in their respective
 appellate briefs. In particular, we direct the parties to
 address, among other things, the following three issues regarding
 mootness:
 
(1)	 Why each issue that the Brown Appellants raise on
appeal is or is not moot as a result of the Brown
Appellants' failure to assert a timely appeal directly
from the January 9, 2009 order confirming the
arbitration award pursuant to HRS § 658A-28(a)(3)?
The parties shall include within this discussion
whether the arbitration proceeding covered the
following two areas: (a) Appellee HMSA's duty and/or
right, if any, to report to the National Practitioners
Data Bank about the Brown Appellants; and (b) the
claims asserted in the second count in the Brown
 Appellants' complaint in this case.
 
(2)	 Whether, in light of the Brown Appellants' failure to
assert a timely appeal directly from the January 9,
2009 order confirming the arbitration award pursuant
1
to HRS § 658A-28(a)(3),  the Brown Appellants' current
appeal from the February 11, 2010 amended judgment
pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009)
2
 
entitles the Brown Appellants to obtain appellate
review of the January 9, 2009 order confirming the
 
1
  Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 658A-28(a) (Supp. 2009)
references an appeal from an order confirming an arbitration award or a finaljudgment entered pursuant to HRS Chapter 658A: 
§ 658A-28. Appeals.
 
(a) An appeal may be taken from: 
(1) An order denying a motion to compel arbitration;
(2) An order granting a motion to stay arbitration;
(3) An order confirming or denying confirmation of an
award;
(4) An order modifying or correcting an award;
(5) An order vacating an award without directing a
rehearing; or
(6) A final judgment entered pursuant to this chapter. 
(b) An appeal under this section shall be taken as from an
order or a judgment in a civil action.
 
HRS § 658A-28 (Supp. 2009) (emphases added)
 
2
 HRS § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009) authorizes an appeal from a
final judgment pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure and 
the holding in Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119,
869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994).

(3)	 Whether the "capable of repetition, yet evading
review" exception to the mootness doctrine applies to
this appeal?
 
The parties shall proceed to file their respective appellate
 
briefs pursuant to HRAP Rule 28.
