DATHANIEL WOOLSEY, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI» I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(SPP NO. 10-1-0001; CR. NO. 08-1-0210)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Dathaniel Woolsey ("Woolsey")
 
appeals from the Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Order
 
Denying Petitioner Dathaniel Woolsey's Rule 40 HRPP, Petition for
 Post-Conviction Relief, filed on June 2, 2010, in the Circuit
 Court of the Fifth Circuit ("Circuit Court").
1 In the Petition
 
to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release
 Petitioner from Custody filed on March 18, 2010, Woolsey sought
 to set aside his conviction and sentence because he was coerced
 by his attorney into entering a no contest plea.
 
In the document entitled "Opening Brief" that he filed
 
on September 30, 2011, Woolsey claims that:
 
[T]he transcript of my court record's [sic] in my
original case will show that Judge [R]andal [G.B.]
Valenciano did in fact talk about a letter I wrote to
 him at my preliminary hearing. [W]ere as for public
Defender [E]dmund [A]coba threatening me with
psychiatric commitment if I did not sign some papers.
[H]e would not let anyone help me in understanding
what was going on. I beg this court to please
understand this is about illegal vote's [sic] thats
why said Judge denyed [sic] my rule 40! [B]ecause of
fear of retaliation, I knowing, and voluntary
withdrawal and ask the dismissal of this case.

 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.

It appears that Woolsey now requests to withdraw his 
appeal. In any event, the Opening Brief and lack of the 
preliminary hearing transcript provides us with no basis upon which to overturn the Circuit Court's decision, and we can find no error in the record before us. State v. Hoang, 93 Hawai» i 
333, 334, 3 P.3d 499, 500 (2000) (court is unable to review asserted errors where appellant has failed to provide transcript of proceedings); State v. Cornelio, 68 Haw. 644, 646-47, 727 
P.2d 1125, 1126-27 (1986) (defendant must establish manifest injustice in order to withdraw no contest plea); Haw. R. Pen. P. 40(a)(3). 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Findings of Fact;
 
Conclusions of Law; Order Denying Petitioner Dathaniel Woolsey's
 
Rule 40, HRPP, Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, filed on
 June 2, 2010, in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit is
 affirmed.
