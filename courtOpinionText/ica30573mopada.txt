APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In appellate case number 30573 (30573), Craig Dobbin
 
(Dobbin) and Wagner Engineering Services, Inc. (WESI)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(collectively, Appellants) appeal from the May 19, 2010 Judgment 
(2010 Judgment) entered in the Circuit Court of the Fifth 
Circuit. Judgment was entered in favor of Caren Diamond 
(Diamond) and Beau Blair (Blair) and against State of Hawai' i 
Board of Land and Natural Resources (BLNR), Dobbin, and WESI. BLNR cross-appealed from the 2010 Judgment. 
In appellate case number CAAP-11-0000345 (CAAP-11-345),
 
Appellants appeal from the March 31, 2011 Judgment (2011
 
Judgment) also entered in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit
1
 
(circuit court) in favor of Diamond and Blair and against BLNR,
 Dobbin, and WESI. BLNR cross-appealed from the 2011 Judgment.
 
On August 25, 2011, this court consolidated 30573 and
 
CAAP-11-345 for decision.
 
The circuit court's 2010 Judgment was rendered moot
 
when BLNR filed its "Amended Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law
 
and Decision and Order" (BLNR Amended D&O) on May 21, 2010. 
Therefore, we do not address the issues raised in 30573. See
 
Wong v. Bd. of Regents, University of Hawaii, 62 Haw. 391, 394,
 616 P.2d 201, 203-04 (1980). See also Application of Thomas, 73
 
Haw. 223, 225-26, 832 P.2d 253, 254 (1992). 
On appeal, Appellants contend the circuit court erred
 
in reversing and vacating the BLNR Amended D&O when
 
(1) the actions of BLNR were consistent with the
 
statutory authority granted to it;
 
(2) BLNR's findings of fact were not clearly erroneous
 
in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on
 the whole record;
 
(3) BLNR correctly exercised its discretion and
 
committed no error of law; and
 
(4) the circuit court wrongfully substituted its own
 
judgment on the evidence and ignored BLNR'S determination.

 The Honorable Kathleen N.A. Watanabe presided over both matters.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On cross-appeal, BLNR, contends the circuit court erred
 
when
 
(1) it incorrectly applied the standard of review;
 
(2) it failed to confine its review to the record on
 
appeal and improperly engaged in fact finding; and
 
(3) it found BLNR's interpretation of Hawaii Revised
 
Statutes (HRS) § 205A-1 to be erroneous.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
Dobbin is the owner of the property identified as 7310 
Alealea Road, on the island of Kaua' i, also identified as Tax Map 
Key No. (4)5-8-009:051 (the Property). Diamond and Blair are 
residents of Kaua' i and reside near the Property. Diamond and 
Blair both use the beach, public resources, and the shoreline area in close proximity to the Property. 
Dobbin hired WESI to survey the Property and on 
January 11, 2008, WESI submitted the application to the
 
Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) for shoreline
 
certification. On April 18, 2008, DLNR and the State Land
 
Surveyor (State Surveyor) conducted a site visit of the Property. 
Based on that site visit, the State Surveyor recommended that
 
"the State of Hawaii should have no objections to adopting the
 
dune crest as the shoreline as delineated on the map, prepared by
 
[WESI], Licensed Professional Land Surveyor."
 
On June 27, 2008, Diamond and Blair filed an appeal
 
with BLNR contesting the proposed shoreline for the Property. On
 
June 19, 2009, BLNR issued its "Findings of Facts, Conclusions of
 
Law, and Decision and Order" (BLNR D&O) approving the proposed
 
shoreline boundary and denying Diamond and Blair's appeal. On
 
June 25, 2009, the proposed certified shoreline map was
 
finalized.
 
On July 20, 2009, Diamond and Blair filed a notice of
 
appeal with the circuit court. On April 6, 2010, the circuit
 
court entered its "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law; Decision
 
and Order" (April 6, 2010 D&O), which vacated the BLNR D&O and
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
remanded the matter back to BLNR. On May 19, 2010, the circuit
 
court entered judgment. Appellants appealed to this court and
 
BLNR cross-appealed in 30573.
 
On remand, BLNR issued its BLNR Amended D&O dated May
 
21, 2010, placing the shoreline in the same location as
 
previously approved by the BLNR. On February 16, 2011,
 
subsequent to another appeal filed by Diamond and Blair, the
 
circuit court entered its "Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law;
 
Decision and Order" (February 16, 2011 D&O), reversing and
 
vacating the BLNR Amended D&O. The circuit court entered
 
judgment on March 31, 2011. Appellants appealed to this court
 
and BLNR cross-appealed in CAAP-11-345.
 
II. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 
A. Administrative Agencies
 
In determining whether an agency determination should
be given deference, the standard to be applied is as
follows:
 
[W]hen reviewing a determination of an administrative
agency, we first decide whether the legislature
granted the agency discretion to make the
determination being reviewed. If the legislature has
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then we review the agency's action pursuant to
the deferential abuse of discretion standard (bearing
in mind that the legislature determines the boundaries
of that discretion). If the legislature has not
granted the agency discretion over a particular
matter, then the agency's conclusions are subject to
de novo review.
 
Paul's Electrical Service, Inc. v. Befitel, 104 Hawai' i 412,
419-20, 91 P.3d 494, 501-[02] (2004). 
Olelo: The Corp. for Cmty. Television v. Office of Info. 
Practices, 116 Hawai' i 337, 344, 173 P.3d 484, 491 (2007). 
B. Administrative Agency Decisions - Secondary Appeals
 
Review of a decision made by the circuit court upon
its review of an agency's decision is a secondary appeal.
In an appeal from a circuit court's review of an
administrative decision the appellate court will utilize
identical standards applied by the circuit court. Questions
of fact are reviewed under the "clearly erroneous" standard.
In contrast, an agency's legal conclusions are freely
reviewable. An agency's interpretation of its rules
receives deference unless it is plainly erroneous or
inconsistent with the underlying legislative purpose.

Indus. Relations, 110 Hawai' i 259, 265, 132 P.3d 368, 374 (2006) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
Appellants and BLNR contend the circuit court abused
 
its discretion in engaging in fact finding and ignoring the
 deference afforded to agencies with respect to issues of fact. 
The circuit court held that twenty-three of BLNR's findings of
 
fact from the BLNR Amended D&O were "clearly erroneous in view of
 
the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole
 
record[.]" Appellants argue that the circuit court's "review of
 
the findings of fact contained in the [BLNR Amended D&O]
 
consisted of the circuit court's wholesale dismissal of the
 
[BLNR's] findings of fact and the insertion of its own findings
 
of fact based on the circuit court's own interpretation of the
 
evidence."
 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that courts are free 
to reverse an agency decision if affected by an error of law, 
but, "in deference to the administrative agency's expertise and 
experience in its particular field, the courts should not 
substitute their own judgment for that of the administrative 
agency where mixed questions of fact and law are presented." 
Camara v. Agsalud, 67 Haw. 212, 216, 685 P.2d 794, 797 (1984). 
Furthermore, an appellate court's review of an agency decision is 
"qualified by the principle that the agency's decision carries a 
presumption of validity and appellant has the heavy burden of 
making a convincing showing that the decision is invalid because 
it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences." Paul v. 
Dep't of Transp., State of Hawai' i, 115 Hawai' i 416, 425, 168 P.3d 
546, 555 (2007). 
BLNR's findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly 
erroneous standard. See Hawaii Teamsters & Allied Workers, Local 
996 v. Dep't of Labor & Indus. Relations, 110 Hawai' i 259, 265, 
132 P.3d 368, 374 (2006). A finding of fact is "clearly 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to
 
support the finding or determination, or (2) despite substantial
 
evidence to support the finding or determination, the appellate
 
court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a
 
mistake has been made." Del Monte Fresh Produce (Hawaii), Inc.
 
v. Int'l Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 142, AFL-CIO, 112 Hawai'i 489, 499, 146 P.3d 1066, 1076 (2006) (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (quoting In re Water Use Permit Applications, 94 Hawai'i 97, 119, 9 P.3d 409, 431 (2000)). 
The circuit court's February 16, 2011 D&O demonstrated
 
that it engaged in unwarranted fact finding and weighing of the
 
evidence. Findings of Fact 28 through 40 rely on evidence
 
submitted by Diamond and Blair which support the finding of a
 
2
shoreline further mauka  than the shoreline certified by BLNR.
The circuit court found that Diamond and Blair "have both
 
observed and photographed over the recent years that as the
 
winter waves wash on [the Property], the waves push sand and
 
other debris mauka[,]" and the evidence submitted by Diamond and
 
Blair "clearly shows" a shoreline boundary which is further mauka
 
than the boundary approved by BLNR.
 
Based on the evidence submitted by Diamond and Blair,
 
the circuit court concluded that the
 
map of the certified shoreline published on June 8, 2008 and
signed by the Chairperson on June 25, 2009 based upon the
"conditions existing on December 4, 2007" does not correctly
reflect the "upper reaches of the wash of the waves at high
tide during the season of the year in which the highest wash
of the waves occurs", as provided in HRS §205A-1."
 
The circuit court further reasoned that 
[t]he BLNR's characterization as either "anecdotal evidence
and/or unreliable evidence" with respect to both the
detailed Declarations of Cared Diamond, Beau Blair and
Barbara Robeson, and the photographs they submitted in
support of their appeal is arbitrary, capricious and/or
characterized by an abuse of discretion or clearly
unwarranted exercise of discretion[.]

Elbert, Hawaiian Dictionary at 242 (1986).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
BLNR did not disregard the evidence submitted by
 
Diamond and Blair, but instead weighed the strength of Diamond
 
and Blair's evidence against evidence presented by DLNR and the
 
State Surveyor. BLNR found that Blair's "testimony did not refer
 
to specific observations she made of the shoreline, either as to
 
the location of the highest wash of the waves or any dates when
 
these high tides occurred." BLNR found the photographic evidence
 
submitted by Diamond and Blair was either unclear, did not
 
contain an accurate depiction of the waves or high water mark, or
 
did not contain accurate dates on when the photos were taken.
 In contrast, BLNR, in the BLNR Amended D&O, found the
 
findings of DLNR and the State Surveyor that were based on the
 
April 18, 2008 site visit, to be persuasive. BLNR, in relying on
 
these findings, found that DLNR and the State Surveyor considered
 
"in their shoreline determination, any pertinent information
 
about the shoreline that is presented by the owner of the subject
 
property and any other member of the public that has personal
 
knowledge and familiarity with the shoreline conditions of the
 
subject property[.]" DLNR and the State Surveyor found the area
 
had "undergone a significant change in the character of its
 
coastal vegetation species distribution. . . . This is having a
 
notable impact on the shape and elevation of the frontal dune as
 
well as the extent of inundation for wash of the waves." BLNR
 
acknowledged that the previous site visit of October 19, 2005,
 
identified a shoreline that was further mauka than the proposed
 
shoreline location. However, BLNR noted that DLNR and the State
 
Surveyor found there was no evidence that the waves had extended
 
to the October 19, 2005 shoreline location in the previous two
 
winters.
 
In Findings of Fact 27 through 38 and Conclusions of
 
Law 8 and 9 of the April 6, 2010 D&O, the circuit court
 
substituted its own judgment for that of BLNR in weighing the
 
evidence presented to BLNR. BLNR was presented with adequate
 
evidence supporting its ultimate shoreline determination, and as
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
such, its findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. While it
 
is true that BLNR was presented with evidence showing the
 
shoreline to be further mauka, it was within the discretion of
 
BLNR, relying on its expertise, to weigh all the evidence and
 
make a factual determination. Therefore, the circuit court erred
 
in failing to give proper deference to BLNR's findings of facts
 
in certifying the shoreline boundary.
 
Additionally, the circuit court erred when it held that 
[t]he BLNR's interpretation of HRS §205A-1,  et. seq. that
only the "current" year's evidence of the upper reaches of
the wash of the waves should be considered in determining
the shoreline is arbitrary, capricious and/or characterized
by an abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of
discretion in applying HRS §205A-1, et. seq., as it
conflicts with and/or contradicts the purpose and intent of
HRS §205A-1, et, seq."
 
The circuit court's characterization of BLNR's findings
 
as only allowing evidence from the current year to determine the
 
upper reaches of the wave is a misstatement of BLNR's findings.
 
BLNR found "[c]ontrary to [Diamond and Blair's] allegation, the
 
State Surveyor and [DLNR] did incorporate and consider [Diamond
 
and Blair's] historical evidence but determined that the direct
 
evidence from the site visit was more compelling for the purposes
 
of locating the shoreline that is representative of the current
 
conditions." BLNR did not restrict its analysis of the upper
 
reaches of the waves to the current year, but rather, "took into
 
evaluation all relevant factors present on [the Property]."
 
The BLNR Amended D&O was not contrary to the definition
 
of "shoreline boundary" as defined by HRS § 205A-1:
 
the upper reaches of the wash of the waves, other than storm
and seismic waves, at high tide during the season of the
year in which the highest wash of the waves occurs, usually
evidenced by the edge of vegetation growth, or the upper
limit of debris left by the wash of the waves.
 
HRS § 205A-1. The debris line and the line marking the edge of 
vegetation growth are used as evidence to determine the 
shoreline, depending on the location and stability of each line. 
See Diamond v. State, Bd. of Land and Natural Resources, 112 
Hawai'i 161, 175, 145 P.3d 704, 718 (2006). BLNR's certification 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
was not contrary to the definition of shoreline boundary. BLNR
 
properly considered all evidence in determining the highest wash
 
of the waves. The circuit court erred in substituting its
 
judgment for BLNR.
