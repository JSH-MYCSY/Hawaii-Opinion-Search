IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
ANTHONY KASSEBEER, JR., aka Tony Boy, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 04-1-0688)
 
ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
 
AND REGARDING RESPONSE TO ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of the Motion to Dismiss Appeal 
Pursuant to Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 
42(c) filed by William H. Jameson, counsel for Defendant-
Appellant Anthony Kassebeer, Jr. (Appellant); the papers in support, and the records and files herein, it appears that: (1) on June 21, 2010, Appellant filed a notice of appeal from a
 judgment of conviction and sentence entered in the Circuit Court
 of the First Circuit; (2) Appellant did not file the statement of
 jurisdiction or the opening brief; (3) on May 26, 2011, this
 court issued an order, which provides in relevant part:
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant shall file the statement
of jurisdiction within ten days from the date of this order
and file the opening brief within thirty days from the date
of this order. Alternatively, Appellant may file a
dismissal of the appeal pursuant to HRAP Rule 42(c). 
(4) HRAP Rule 42(c) governs dismissal of appeals in criminal
 
cases and provides:
 
In a criminal appeal by a defendant, the stipulation or
motion for dismissal of the appeal shall be supported by the
defendant’s affidavit or declaration that reflects a knowing
and intelligent understanding of the consequences of the
dismissal of the appeal and that the withdrawal is made
voluntarily. In circumstances where the defendant cannot be
 located after a diligent effort, the circumstances of the
effort should be set forth in an affidavit or declaration of
 counsel in support of the stipulation or motion. 
(5) the motion to dismiss is not supported by Appellant’s
 
declaration, but the declaration of Appellant's counsel,
 William H. Jameson, Jr. (Jameson), in support of the motion to
 dismiss states that Jameson has made numerous efforts to contact
 Appellant where Appellant resides, and Appellant has failed to
 respond to Jameson. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motion to Dismiss Appeal 
Pursuant to HRAP Rule 42(c) is granted. 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no further action shall be 
taken on the order to show cause issued on May 26, 2011. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, July 25, 2011.
