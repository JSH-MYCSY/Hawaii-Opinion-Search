APPEAL FROM THE LABOR AND INDUSTRIAL APPEALS BOARD
 
(CASE NO. AB 2007-552 (2-07-04407))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Claimant-Appellant Maui Kahawaiolaa (Kahawaiolaa)
 
appeals from the Decision and Order (Decision) of the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB) filed on May 24, 2010. 
LIRAB affirmed the November 13, 2007 decision of the Director
 
(Director) of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations
 
denying Kahawaiolaa's claims for psychological stress and a right
 
clavicle injury on the basis that his claims did not arise out of
 
and in the course of his employment.
 
On appeal, Kahawaiolaa contends LIRAB erroneously
 
upheld the Director's decision and wrongly concluded that
 
Kahawaiolaa "engaged in a substantial deviation from and a
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
distinct departure from his employment" as a flight attendant
 
when he changed a lightbulb at his mother's house while on a
 
layover. Kahawaiolaa claimed that at the time of the accident he
 
was suffering from work-related mental stress as a result of
 
having been notified of pending disciplinary action against him
 
and the stress caused him to black out while changing a
 
lightbulb, fall, and break his clavicle. Related to this
 
argument is his contention that in the Decision, Findings of Fact
 
(FOFs) 14 and 15 are clearly erroneous.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Kahawaiolaa's points of error as follows:
 
(1) In his opening brief, Kahawaiolaa fails to dispute
 
numerous FOFs in the Decision that support LIRAB's ultimate
 
determination. LIRAB's FOFs, excluding FOFs 14 and 15 which
 
Kahawaiolaa does dispute, support LIRAB's conclusion that
 
Employer-Appellee United Airlines, Inc. met its burden of proving
 
that Kahawaiolaa's injuries were not work-related. Thus,
 
Kahawaiolaa's failure to challenge LIRAB's FOFs in his points of
 
error provides a basis for us to affirm the Decision. See Wisdom
 
v. Pflueger, 4 Haw. App. 455, 459, 667 P.2d 844, 848 (1983); Okada Trucking Co., Ltd. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai' i 450, 
458, 40 P.3d 73, 81 (2002). 
(2) Even if we were to overlook the deficiency in
 
Kahawaiolaa's brief, we would still affirm the Decision because
 Kahawaiolaa's claims are noncompensable.
 
(a) Kahawaiolaa's claim for mental stress was
 
based on threatened disciplinary action regarding a confrontation
 
he had with a co-worker over comments the co-worker allegedly
 
made to Kahawaiolaa's girlfriend about Kahawaiolaa. The claim
 
was not compensable because it did not arise "out of and in the
 
course of" Kahawaiolaa's employment. HRS ยง 386-3(a) & (c) (Supp.

(b) Because the claim for mental stress was not 
compensable, the claim for a broken clavicle was not compensable. 
Davenport, 100 Hawai' i at 494, 60 P.3d at 895. 
(c)
 
Because neither claim was compensable, we
 
need not address whether Kahawaiolaa "engaged in a substantial
 
deviation from and a distinct departure from his employment" when
 
he changed a lightbulb at his mother's house while on a layover. 
Regardless of whether LIRAB's FOFs 14 and 15 are clearly
 
erroneous, any error was harmless.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Decision and Order of the
 
Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board filed on May 24,
 2010 is affirmed.
