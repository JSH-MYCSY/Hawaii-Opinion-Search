NO. 30582
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
WAYSON W.C. CHONG, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CRIMINAL NO. 09-1-2176)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Wayson W.C. Chong ("Chong") appeals
 
from the Judgment of Conviction and Sentence, filed on May 25,
 
2010, in the Family Court of the First Circuit ("Family Court").1
 
After a bench trial, the Family Court convicted Chong on one
 count of Violation of an Order for Protection under section 586­11, Hawaii Revised Statutes (Supp. 2008).
2 Chong was sentenced
 
to one year of probation and a $150 fine. 
On appeal, Chong challenges (1) the Family Court's
 
September 21, 2010 findings of fact ("FOF") 9, 17, 20, 22, 24,
 26-27, 33 and conclusions of law ("COL") 2-4; and (2) the
 sufficiency of the evidence in support of his conviction. In
 addition, although not argued below, Chong contends that his
 conduct constituted a de minimis infraction, and that his
 conviction, therefore, should be reversed or, alternatively,
 dismissed.

 Chong was charged with two counts of intentionally or knowingly
violating the September 9, 2009 Order for Protection, issued in FC-DA No. 09­
1-1872 ("Protective Order"), on or about October 5, 2009. The term of the
 Protective Order was for two years. One count was dismissed.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Chong's points of error as follows:
 
(1) The challenged FOF and COL are not clearly
 
erroneous (FOF 9, 17, 22, and 24), are properly supported and
 reflect an application of the correct rule of law (COL 2 and 3),
 or are harmless (FOF 20, 26, 27 and 33; COL 4).
 
(2) Our review for sufficiency of evidence on appeal is
 
limited to determining whether, considering the evidence in the
 light most favorable to the prosecution, substantial evidence
 exists in support of the decision:
 
The test on appeal is not whether guilt is established
beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was substantial
evidence to support the conclusion of the trier of fact.
Indeed, even if it could be said in a bench trial that the
conviction is against the weight of the evidence, as long as
there is substantial evidence to support the requisite
findings for conviction, the trial court will be affirmed.
 
State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai' i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 322, 330-31 
(2007) (citation omitted). In this case, substantial evidence 
supports Chong's conviction. 
Complainant was the petitioner and Chong was the
 
respondent with regard to the Protective Order issued against
 Chong, who is Complainant's father. The Protective Order
 prohibited Chong from contacting the Complainant as well as Lee
 E. Winters, Jr. ("Winters"), who is Chong's step-father. Limited
 contact between Chong and the Complainant was permitted for
 certain enumerated issues unrelated to the incident in question. 
As allowed by the Protective Order, Chong and Winters both reside 
at 3135 Oahu Avenue in Honolulu, in a residence that has separate
 units. The Complainant is a caregiver for Winters, who is
 bedridden. The Protective Order provides that "[i]f the parties
 run into each other, the Respondent must leave immediately." 
At trial, Complainant testified that on October 5,
 
2009, she received a telephone call from her step-grandfather's
 on-call caregiver, who explained that Chong was outside of her
 step-grandfather's room. Thinking that Chong's presence outside
 the room was prohibited by the Protective Order, Complainant came
 
2
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
over to the home immediately to "make sure that everything was
 
okay with my grandfather." After speaking with the caregiver,
 Complainant went into her step-grandfather's room and observed
 Chong, approximately ten to fifteen feet away "outside doing what
 appeared to be maybe yard work or he was just sort of meandering
 around." Complainant and Chong looked at each other, and Chong
 "sort of laughed" and said, "'I'm supposed to be a hundred feet
 away from you.'" Then, he "just kept going on with his business,
 what he was doing."
 
A protective order that envisions frequent contact
 
between the parties requires vigilance to honor. In the instant
 case, Chong needed to remove himself from his position
 immediately outside Winters' sliding glass door when he became
 aware that Complainant was in Winters' room. When he did not, he
 violated the Protective Order. There was sufficient evidence to
 support Chong's conviction.
 
(3) The Family Court did not plainly err by failing to
 
dismiss the charge against Chong on the basis that his conduct
 was de minimis because (a) his conduct "actually cause[d] or
 threaten[ed] the harm or evil sought to be prevented by the law
 defining the offense[,]" i.e., to prevent violations of
 protective orders, and (b) the Family Court was not wrong to
 conclude that Chong had the requisite mens rea in committing the
 offense. H
AW. REV. STAT. § 702-236(1)(b). 
Even if we were not limited to reviewing for plain 
error, a trial court's decision to not dismiss a prosecution on the basis that it was "too trivial to warrant the condemnation of conviction" is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. State v. 
Park, 55 Haw. 610, 617, 525 P.2d 586, 591-92 (1974). Chong's failure to immediately remove himself from his position outside Winters' sliding glass door provides sufficient justification for the Family Court's decision. See State v. Wise, 107 Hawai' i 67, 
71, 109 P.3d 708, 712 (App. 2005) (trial court's failure to sua sponte dismiss charge affirmed, despite contention that contact was brief and defendant drove off soon after he was reminded of restraining order); Cf. State v. Akina, 73 Haw. 75, 828 P.2d 269 (1992) (trial court's decision not to dismiss reversed as abuse

of discretion where complaining witness agreed that defendant
 
"was just trying to help").
 
Chong's intent to knowingly or intentionally violate
 
the Protective Order is established by the fact that Chong was in
 the courtroom when the Protective Order was entered, that he
 recited to Complainant the condition in the Protective Order that
 he was to honor if he encountered Complainant on the property,
 and that he thereafter failed to honor the condition. See State
 
v. Agard, 113 Hawai' i 321, 324, 151 P.3d 802, 805 (2007) ("Given 
the difficulty of proving the requisite state of mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, proof by circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the defendant's conduct is sufficient." (quoting State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai'i 131, 141, 913 P.2d 57, 67, (1996) (internal quotation 
marks omitted))). 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Sentence, filed on May 25, 2010, in the Family Court of the
 First Circuit is affirmed.
