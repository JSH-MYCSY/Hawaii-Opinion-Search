(By:

Defendants-Appellants Robert C. Reish and Susan N.
 
Reish, Individually and as Trustees for the Reish 1995 Family
 
Trust as created by Declaration of Trust dated September 18,
 
1995, (Reish Trust) appeal from the "Order Denying Defendants'
 
Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Defendants' Motion
 
for Order Expunging Notice of Pendency of Action, Filed on
 
November 4, 2009," filed April 26, 2010 (April 26, 2010 Order) in 
NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1 (circuit court). The
 
circuit court's order was in favor of Plaintiffs-Appellees
 
Rodillo M. Tabuyo Sr. and Merlina D. Tabuyo (Tabuyo Plaintiffs),
 
who had filed the Notice of Pendency of Action against Reish
 
Trust.
 
I.
 
On December 17, 2007, Reish Trust loaned Tabuyo
 
Plaintiffs $150,000. The loan was secured by a "Purchase Money
 
Real Property Mortgage" (second mortgage) held by Reish Trust on
 
real property (Property) owned by Tabuyo Plaintiffs. Tabuyo
 
Plaintiffs agreed to pay an interest rate of 14% per year, with
 
the total loan due January 1, 2009.
 
Tabuyo Plaintiffs defaulted on the loan and Reish Trust
 
initiated a non-judicial foreclosure action against Tabuyo
 
Plaintiffs. The auction was held May 6, 2009, and Reish Trust
 
bought the Property for $50,000, subject to the first mortgage.2
 
On May 15, 2009, a "Limited Warranty Deed Pursuant to 
Power of Sale" was filed in the State of Hawai» i Bureau of 
Conveyances, purportedly conveying title of the Property to Reish Trust. Reish Trust entered into a contract to sell the Property 
to a third party, with the recording of the sale scheduled for 
September 11, 2009. 
On September 10, 2009, in its Commitment for Title
 
Insurance related to the anticipated sale, First American Title
 
Company, Inc. indicated that a Notice of Pendency of Action had
 
been filed September 1, 2009, claiming right to title and
 
possession of the Property. On September 14, 2009, Reish Trust
 
filed a Motion for Order Expunging Notice of Pendency of Action.
 
On September 24, 2009, the circuit court denied the motion 
without prejudice and on November 4, 2009, entered its "Order
 
Denying [Reish Trust's] Motion for Order Expunging Notice of

Pendency of Action Filed September 14, 2009" (November 4, 2009
 
Order Denying Expungement).
 
On November 12, 2009, Reish Trust filed a Hawai» i Rules 
of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) "Motion for Reconsideration 
of [November 4, 2009 Order Denying Expungment]" (November 12, 
2009 Motion for Reconsideration). The circuit court orally 
denied the motion December 8, 2009, but did not file its written 
order denying the November 12, 2009 Motion for Reconsideration 
until April 26, 2010. 
On May 25, 2010, pursuant to Hawai» i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP) Rule 4(a)(4)(A), Reish Trust filed an "Ex Parte 
Motion to Extend Time to File Notice of Appeal" (Motion to Extend 
Time). The circuit court granted the motion, extending the time 
to file a notice of appeal from May 26, 2010 to June 25, 2010.3 
On June 24, 2010, Reish Trust filed its notice of appeal. 
II.
 
It is axiomatic that we are under an obligation to
ensure that we have jurisdiction to hear and determine each
case and to dismiss an appeal on our own motion where we
conclude we lack jurisdiction. When we perceive a
jurisdictional defect in an appeal, we must, sua sponte,
dismiss that appeal.

quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted).
 
Brooks v. Dana Nance & Co. , 113 Hawai» i 406, 412, 153 P.3d 1091, 
1097 (2007). 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect the parties cannot waive
 
and the appellate courts cannot disregard. Bacon, 68 Haw. at
 
650, 727 P.2d at 1129; HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or 
justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 
contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Reish Trust's notice of
 
appeal is untimely under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3) and Rule 4(a)(4)(A).
 
An order denying a motion to expunge a notice of
 
pendency of action "is a collateral order that is immediately

 The circuit court granted the motion to extend time on May 26, 2010,
but did not enter the order until June 1, 2010.

appealable as a final order pursuant to Hawai i Revised Statutes 
§ 641 1(a) (Supp.2007)." Canales v. Artiga , 118 Hawai» i 421, 
422, 192 P.3d 610, 611 (2008); see also Knauer v. Foote, 101 
Hawai» i 81, 85, 63 P.3d 389, 393 (2003). Under HRAP Rule 
4(a)(3), certain motions, such as a motion for reconsideration, extends the time for filing a notice of appeal "until 30 days 
after entry of an order disposing of the motion; provided, that 
the failure to dispose of any motion by order entered upon the 
record within 90 days after the date the motion was filed shall 
constitute a denial of the motion." HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). 
On November 12, 2009, Reish Trust filed its Motion for 
Reconsideration. The circuit court had ninety days to dispose of 
the motion by order or the motion would be automatically deemed 
denied. The circuit court failed to enter an order either 
granting or denying the motion prior to February 10, 2010, ninety 
days after the motion was filed. Thus, Reish Trust's November 
12, 2009 Motion for Reconsideration was automatically deemed 
denied February 10, 2010. See Cnty of Hawai» i v. C&J Coupe 
Family Ltd. P'ship, 119 Hawai» i 352, 367, 198 P.3d 615, 630 
(2008) ("As noted before, because the court failed to issue an 
order on Appellant's motion by January 9, 2008, ninety days after 
Appellant filed the motion, the motion was deemed denied."). 
Consequently, at the end of the day February 10, 2010, Reish 
Trust's November 12, 2009 Motion for Reconsideration was no 
longer pending for decision by the circuit court. Furthermore, 
the deemed denial on February 10, 2010, triggered the 30-day time 
period to file an appeal under HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). Reish Trust 
did not file its June 24, 2010 notice of appeal within thirty 
days of the February 10, 2010 deemed denial nor seek an extension 
within the time allowed under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4). Therefore, 
Reish Trust's June 24, 2010, notice of appeal was not timely 
filed.
