IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
MARSHALL MARTINEZ, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 09-1-0009(1))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.) 
Petitioner-Appellant Marshall Martinez (Martinez) 
appeals from the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and 
Decision and Order Dismissing HRPP Rule 40 Petition Filed on 
May 15, 2009" (5/28/10 FOF/COL/Order), entered on May 28, 2010, 
in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (circuit court).1 The 
circuit court dismissed Martinez's Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief (Rule 40 
Petition),2
 which he filed on May 15, 2009, on the ground that it
failed "to present a colorable claim for relief and [wa]s
 
patently frivolous and without merit[.]"

 The Honorable Joel E. August issued the 5/28/10 FOF/COL/Order.

 On April 27, 2009, Martinez, pro se, filed a Writ of Habeas Corpus
in the circuit court, which the court treated as a Rule 40 Petition in an
order entered on May 15, 2009.

On appeal, Martinez argues that the circuit court erred 
in denying his Rule 40 Petition where (1) he colorably claimed 
that the statute under which he was sentenced, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes (HRS) § 706-662 (Supp. 1988), was void ab initio 
pursuant to State v. Maugaotega, 115 Hawai' i 432, 168 P.3d 562 
(2007) (Maugaotega II), and (2) in sentencing him, the circuit 
court unconstitutionally punished him for unsubstantiated 
allegations of misconduct. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Martinez's points of error as follows:
 
The circuit court did not err by denying Martinez's
 
Rule 40 Petition.
 
(1) The circuit court properly concluded that the 
extended sentencing statute, HRS § 706-662, was not void ab 
initio, based on case law following Maugaotega II. See State v. 
Jess, 117 Hawai' i 381, 407–15, 184 P.3d 133, 159–67 (2008); State 
v. Cutsinger, 118 Hawai' i 68, 79–82, 185 P.3d 816, 827–30 (App. 
2008), overruled in part on other grounds by Jess, 117 Hawai' i at 
398 n.17, 184 P.3d at 150 n.17. 
(2) By not raising his claim that he was sentenced
 
based on unsubstantiated conduct in a direct appeal from his 1988
 
sentence or in his ten prior HRPP Rule 40 petitions, Martinez has
 
waived this claim. Moreover, no plain error in denying
 
Martinez's Rule 40 Petition appears where Martinez was convicted
 
of two prior felonies and Martinez does not argue the
 
circumstances of those offenses do not support the sentencing
 
court's determination that an extended term of imprisonment was
 
necessary for the protection of the public under HRS § 706-662.
 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the "Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Decision and Order Dismissing HRPP
