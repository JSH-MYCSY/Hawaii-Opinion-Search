IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
IN THE INTEREST OF JM
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 07-11563)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Father-Appellant (Father) appeals from the Order
 
Awarding Permanent Custody (Order) entered on June 23, 2010 in
 
the Family Court of the First Circuit (family court).1 In the
 
Order, the family court found, among other things, that Father
 was not willing or able to provide JM with a safe family home,
 
even with the assistance of a service plan, and would not become
 
willing or able to do so within a reasonable period of time. The
 
court granted the Department of Human Services' (DHS's) Motion
 
for Order Awarding Permanent Custody and Establishing a Permanent
 
Plan (Motion for Permanent Custody), divested Father's rights to
 
JM, appointed DHS permanent custodian of JM, and ordered DHS's
 
proposed permanent plan dated January 7, 2009 (Permanent Plan).

On appeal, Father argues that the family court erred in
 
granting DHS's Motion for Permanent Custody, awarding DHS
 
permanent custody of JM, and ordering the Permanent Plan. 
Related to this argument is his contention that in the court's
 
"Supplemental Record on Appeal [Findings of Fact and Conclusions
 
of Law]," entered on September 16, 2010, Findings of Fact (FOF)
 
65-68, 72, 78-80, 82, 84-91, 99-103, 110, 112-13, 115-16, 118,
 
121-29, and 134 are clearly erroneous and Conclusions of Law
 
(COL) 143-46 are wrong.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Father's points of error as follows:
 
There was substantial evidence supporting the Order
 
Awarding Permanent Custody, and COL 143-46 are not wrong.
 
(1) The FOF Father contests are not clearly erroneous
 
because they are supported by substantial evidence in the record.
 
(2) We decline to review the family court's credibility 
determinations set forth in FOF 116 and 122-29 and weight-of-theÂ­
evidence determinations set forth in FOF 65-68, 72, 78-80, 82, 
84-91, and 99-103. In re Doe Children, 108 Hawaif i 134, 141, 117 
P.3d 866, 873 (App. 2005). 
(3) Father misconstrues the record with regard to
 
Arthur Jarrell Spires, whom the court found to be a credible
 witness.
 
(4) Although he contests FOF 110, 112-13, 115, 118, 
121, and 134, Father provides no discernible argument with regard 
to those FOF, and we deem the issues waived. See Kahof ohanohano 
v. Dept. of Human Svcs. State of Haw., 117 Hawaif i 262, 297 n.37,

Custody, entered on June 23, 2010 in the Family Court of the 
First Circuit, is affirmed.
