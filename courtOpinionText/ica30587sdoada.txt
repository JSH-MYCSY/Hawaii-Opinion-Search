Judgment, filed May 27, 2010; Order Granting Defendant State of 
Hawai'i's Motion For Award of Costs Filed March 30, 2010, filed 
5
June 7, 2010;  and Judgment in Favor of Defendants Barbara G.
Kam, Jacquelyn Shook, Bernadette Erwin and State of Hawai' i, 
filed June 29, 2010.6 
On appeal, Kuehu contends that the Circuit Court erred 
by: (1) dismissing all claims against Defendants-Appellees Barbara G. Kam, Jacquelyn Shook, and Bernadette Erwin (collectively, "Co-Employees"); (2) rendering summary judgment in favor of the State of Hawai' i ("State"); (3) rendering summary 
judgment in favor of Gate Gourmet, Inc. ("Gate Gourmet"); and (4) granting the State's motion for award of costs pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 607-14.5 (Supp. 2011). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Kuehu's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Kuehu fails to show that the Circuit Court erred
 
in dismissing the claims against Co-Employees. The Circuit Court
 explained that Kuehu's claims against Co-Employees failed as a
 matter of law and dismissed the first amended complaint without
 prejudice on December 18, 2007. As Kuehu concedes, no motion to
 amend the first amended complaint was filed.

Kuehu's citations to an excerpt of a transcript of a
 
hearing which was held on February 25, 2008 and a document dated
 October 1, 2008, do not address the deficiencies in the first
 amended complaint. Thus, Kuehu's argument is without merit.

 Here and throughout the opening brief, Kuehu incorporates
unspecified additional arguments into her brief by generally referring to the
record rather than articulating specific arguments. The Hawai' i Supreme Court
has held that incorporating arguments by reference from the record into anopening brief violates the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure("HRAP") Rule
28(a) and that such arguments should be disregarded. Kapiolani Comm. Ctr. v. 
A&S P'ship, 68 Haw. 580, 584, 723 P.2d 181, 184–85 (1986). Furthermore,arguments by reference violate HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). While Kuehu proceeds pro
se and we strive to address such cases on their merits, Housing Fin. Dev. Corp. v. Ferguson, 91 Hawai' i 81, 85–86, 979 P.2d 1107, 1111–12 (1999),
general references to the record do not provide us an adequate basis from
which to do so.

(2) Kuehu's argument in support of her second point of
 
error ignores the requirement that an opening brief must contain
 
"the contentions of the appellant on the points presented and the
 reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and
 the parts of the record relied on." Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7). 
To the extent that we are able to discern Kuehu's legal argument,
 she fails to show how the Circuit Court erred in granting the
 State summary judgment. 
(3) Kuehu argues that the Circuit Court erred in
 
granting Gate Gourmet summary judgment because the opinions of
 Mr. Jim Reinhardt ("Reinhardt") and Mr. Raymond Stockton
 ("Stockton") raise a genuine issue of material fact as to
 causation. Kuehu does not argue that the Circuit Court should
 have granted her a continuance and does not challenge the fact
 that she needed to present expert testimony showing causation of
 damages.
 
At the February 3, 2010 hearing, Kuehu admitted that
 
she did not have an expert who could show causation of her
 injuries and, instead, was seeking more time for discovery. 
Indeed, Reinhardt's opinions pertain to conditions at the United
 Airlines Support Facility building at the time of his inspection
 on November 10, 2009, rather than at the time of the alleged
 exposure, and the excerpt of Stockton's memorandum cited by Kuehu
 on appeal is not an opinion, but a statement that he found
 certain documents provided by Kuehu to be "interesting." Thus,
 Kuehu has not shown error.
 
(4) Kuehu's argument focusing on the State's 
entitlement to costs under HRS § 607-14.5 is not on point. Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 54(d)(1) states 
that, except as otherwise provided, "costs shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs . . . ." Here, the State sought costs pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(d) and HRS § 607-9 (which defines the proper scope of an award of costs) as a prevailing party. Because the State moved for costs pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(d)(1) as a prevailing party, HRS § 607-14.5 is inapposite, and Kuehu's argument that costs were erroneously entered is without merit.
