SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Foley, Presiding J., Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiffs-Appellants Heather Winfrey (Winfrey),
 
Individually and as Personal Representative for the Estate of
 
Jasmine Rose Anne Fry, and Samuel J. Fry, Jr. (collectively,
 
Plaintiffs), appeal from the Final Judgment filed on June 14,
 
1
2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court). 
The circuit court entered judgment in favor of Defendant GGP Ala
 
Moana LLC dba Ala Moana Center (Ala Moana) and against
 
Plaintiffs, pursuant to (1) the "Order Granting in Part and
 
Denying in Part Defendant GGP Ala Moana LLC dba Ala Moana

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Center's Motion for Summary Judgment Filed on May 5, 2008," filed
 
on October 27, 2008; (2) the "Order Granting Defendant GGP Ala
 
Moana LLC dba Ala Moana Center's Motion for Reconsideration of
 
the Court's Oral Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part
 
Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment Filed on October 3,
 
2008," filed on April 1, 2009; and (3) the "Clerk's Taxation of
 
Costs for Defendant GGP Ala Moana LLC dba Ala Moana Center, in
 
the amount of $10,718.53," filed on April 2, 2009.
 
On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that the circuit court
 
erred in
 
(1) the "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part
 
Defendant GGP Ala Moana LLC dba Ala Moana Center's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment Filed on May 5, 2008 (Order re: MSJ)," when it
 
found Ala Moana did not owe Plaintiffs a duty of care;
 
(2) the "Order Granting Defendant GGP Ala Moana LLC dba
 
Ala Moana Center's Motion for Reconsideration of the Court's Oral
 
Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment Filed on October 3, 2008 (Order re: Motion for
 
Reconsideration);"
 
(3) the "Order Regarding Defendant-Appellee's Motion 
for Sanctions Pursuant to [Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure] HRCP 
Rule 37 (b), Filed 8/30/07 (Order re: Motion for Sanctions)," when the order subjected the parties to overly restrictive 
conditions and procedures in the taking of depositions. 
The appellate court reviews "the circuit court's grant 
or denial of summary judgment de novo." Querubin v. Thronas, 107 
Hawai'i 48, 56, 109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. 
Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai' i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 
71 (2004)). 
The Hawai' i Supreme Court has often articulated that 
summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions onfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that thereis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that themoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effectof establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Querubin, 107 Hawai' i at 56, 109 P.3d at 697 (quoting Durette, 
105 Hawai' i at 501, 100 P.3d at 71). 
"The trial court's ruling on a motion for
reconsideration is reviewed under the abuse of discretion 
standard." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. 
Wailea Resort Co., 100 Hawai' i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621
(2002) (citation omitted). An abuse of discretion occurs if 
the trial court has "clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonor disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant." Amfac, Inc. v. 
Waikiki Beachcomber Inv. Co., 74 Haw. 85, 114, 839 P.2d 10,
26 (1992) (citation omitted). 
Cho v. State of Hawai' i, 115 Hawai' i 373, 381, 168 P.3d 17, 25 
(2007). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve
 
Plaintiffs' points of error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not err in granting in part
 
and denying in part Ala Moana's Motion for Summary Judgment
 
(MSJ).
 
(a) Ala Moana did not take Fry into custody. 
Plaintiffs contend that Ala Moana had custody of Fry prior to her
 
death. Plaintiffs argue that the alleged act of voluntarily
 
taking custody of Fry created "a duty to take reasonable action
 
to protect [Fry] from unreasonable risk of physical harm." 
However,
 
[w]hen a motion for summary judgment is made and supported
as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon
the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party's
pleading, but the adverse party's response, by affidavits or
as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific
facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial."
 
HRCP Rule 56(e). Furthermore, "[a] party opposing a motion for
 
summary judgment cannot discharge his or her burden by alleging
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
conclusions, nor is he entitled to a trial on the basis of a hope
 
that he can produce some evidence at that time.” Henderson v.
 
Prof'l Coatings Corp., 72 Haw. 387, 401, 819 P.2d 84, 92 (1991)
 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
 
Plaintiffs do not meet their burden of proof. 
Plaintiffs simply allege that "Ala Moana security and maintenance 
personnel were the only people who had access to the . . . 
rooftop[,]" and argue that this fact establishes that "Ala Moana 
through its employees, agents, or representatives took Jasmine 
Fry up on the rooftop." Plaintiffs are correct that “one who is 
required by law to take or who voluntarily takes the custody of 
another under circumstances such as to deprive the other of his 
normal opportunities for protection is under a . . . duty to 
take reasonable action to protect the other person from 
unreasonable risk of physical harm." Lee v. Corregedore, 83 
Hawai'i 154, 159, 925 P.2d 324, 329 (1996) (quoting Restatement 
(Second) of Torts § 314A(4) (1965) (brackets and emphasis 
omitted)). However, Plaintiffs present no evidence that Ala 
Moana voluntarily took custody of Fry in a manner to deprive her 
of her normal opportunity for protection, but instead present 
unsupported allegations, conclusions, and speculation. As such, 
Plaintiffs do not satisfy their burden under HRCP Rule 56(e) to 
show there is a genuine issue for trial regarding this 
allegation. 
(b) As a landlord, Ala Moana did not owe Fry a
 
special duty of care. It is true that "an occupier of land has a
 
duty to use reasonable care for the safety of all persons
 
reasonably anticipated to be upon the premises, regardless of the
 
legal status of the individual." Pickard v. City & Cnty. of
 
Honolulu, 51 Haw. 134, 135, 452 P.2d 445, 446 (1969). However,
 Plaintiffs fail to note that the dispositive question is whether
 
the person was "reasonably anticipated to be upon the premises." 
Although the term "reasonableness" is inherently
 
ambiguous and "summary judgment is usually inappropriate because
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the determination of someone's state of mind usually entails the 
drawing of factual inferences as to which reasonable [minds] 
might differ" reasonableness can constitute "a question of law 
suitable for summary judgment when the facts are undisputed and 
not fairly susceptible of divergent inferences[.]" Courbat v. 
Dahana Ranch, Inc., 111 Hawai' i 254, 263, 141 P.3d 427, 436 
(2006) (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations 
omitted). It is undisputed that Fry was not authorized to be on 
the rooftop and that the rooftop was secured by a locked door and 
a locked gate. Plaintiffs offered no evidence to indicate that 
Ala Moana should have "reasonably anticipated" that Fry would be 
on the rooftop. Because Fry was not "reasonably anticipated to 
be upon the premises," Ala Moana did not owe a duty of reasonable 
care to her. Pickard, 51 Haw. at 135, 452 P.2d at 446. 
(c) Ala Moana did not voluntarily assume a duty
 
of care for Fry's safety. 
One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to
render services to another which he should recognize as
necessary for the protection of a third person or his
things, is subject to liability to the third person for
physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise
reasonable care to protect his undertaking, if
 
(a) his failure to exercise reasonable care increases
the risk of such harm, or
 
(b) he has undertaken to perform a duty owed by the
other to the third person, or
 
(c) the harm is suffered because of reliance of the
other or the third person upon the undertaking.
 
Tabieros v. Clark Equipment Co., 85 Hawai' i 336, 358-59, 944 P.2d 
1279, 1301-02 (1997) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts 
§ 324A (1965)). Plaintiffs do not argue that Ala Moana provided 
services to another for the protection of Fry but, instead, argue 
that Ala Moana undertook to provide protection for Fry, thus 
creating a duty. Because Plaintiffs do not demonstrate how one 
party undertook to provide services to another for the protection 
of a third party, Ala Moana had no duty of care under Restatement 
(Second) of Torts § 324A. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI #I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
     Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A (1965) states:2
(1) A common carrier is under a duty to its passengers to take 
reasonable action
  (a) to protect them against unreasonable risk of physical harm, 
  and 
  (b) to give them first aid after it knows or has reason to know that 
  they are ill or injured, and to care for them until they can be cared 
  for by others.
(2) An innkeeper is under a similar duty to his guests.
(3)
sim A possessor of land who holds it open to the public is under a
ilar duty to members of the public who enter in response to his
invitation.
(4) One who is required by law to take or who voluntarily takes the 
custody of another under circumstances such as to deprive the other 
of his normal opportunities for protection is under a similar duty to 
the other.
(Emphasis added.)
6(d)  Ala Moana did not have a legal duty to render
aid to Fry. Unless there is a special relationship between the
actor and the individual facing harm,
[t]he general rule is that a person does not have a duty to
act affirmatively to protect another person from harm. "The
fact that the actor realized or should realize that action
on his [or her] part is necessary for another's aid or
protection does not of itself impose upon him [or her] a
duty to take such action." Restatement (Second) of Torts 
§ 314 (1965)
Lee v. Corregedore, 83 Hawai# i at 159, 925 P.2d at 329.  Under
the undisputed evidence in the record, there existed no special
relationship between Ala Moana and Fry to trigger a duty to
render aid. See  Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314A2.  Fry was
not in an area held open to the public and was not on the rooftop
or in the duct at Ala Moana's invitation.
(e)  Res ipsa loquitur does not apply to the
present case.  Plaintiffs' final substantive argument is that Ala
Moana owed Fry a duty of care under the doctrine of res ipsa
loquitur, which provides that 
whenever a thing that produced an injury is shown to have
been under the control and management of the defendant and
the occurrence is such that in the ordinary course of events
does not happen if due care has been exercised, the fact ofNOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the injury itself will be deemed to afford sufficient
evidence to support a recovery in the absence of any
explanation by the defendant tending to show that the injury
was not due to his want of care.
 
Ciacci v. Woolley, 33 Haw. 247, 257 (1934). 
In order to invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur
in a particular case, this court has held that a plaintiff
must first establish the presence of three conditions or
elements:
 
1. The event must be one which ordinarily does not occur in
the absence of someone's negligence.
 
2. It must be caused by an agency or instrumentality within
the exclusive control of the defendant.
 
3. It must not have been due to any voluntary action or
contribution on the part of the plaintiff.
 
Carlos v. MTL, Inc., 77 Hawai' i 269, 277-78, 883 P.2d 691, 699 ­
700 (App. 1994). 
The undisputed evidence clearly indicates that Fry 
entered the duct work on her own, against the wishes and requests 
of Ala Moana employees. Res ipsa loquitur requires that the 
event "must not have been due to any voluntary action or 
contribution on the part of the plaintiff." Carlos, 77 Hawai' i 
at 278, 883 P.2d at 700. Plaintiffs presented no evidence to rebut Ala Moana's evidence that Fry's death was caused by the 
voluntary actions of Fry. Therefore, the res ipsa loquitur 
doctrine does not apply. 
(2) Whether the circuit court abused its discretion in 
granting Ala Moana's Motion for Reconsideration is a moot point 
since we uphold the summary judgment on Ala Moana's absence of 
duty to render aid to Fry under Lee v Corregedore, supra, not 
Moyle v. Y & Y Hyup Shin, Corp., 118 Hawai' i 385, 191 P.3d 1629. 
(2008). 
(3) The circuit court did not abuse its discretion
 
when it entered its Order re: Motion for Sanctions. Plaintiffs
 contend that the circuit court erred "when it imposed an
 
arbitrary set of procedures to be used at oral depositions in
 
this case." HRCP Rule 26(c) provides that "the court in the
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit where the deposition is to be taken may make any order
 
which justice requires to protect a party or person from
 
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or
 
expense[.]"
 
[T]he extent to which discovery is permitted under [HRCP]
Rule 26 is subject to considerable latitude and the
discretion of the trial court. Thus, the exercise of such
discretion will not be disturbed in the absence of a clear
 abuse of discretion that results in substantial prejudice to
a party. 
Hac v. Univ. of Hawai' i, 102 Hawai 'i 92, 100-01, 73 P.3d 46, 54-55 
(2003) (internal quotation marks, citations, brackets, and 
ellipsis omitted). Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate how the 
circuit court abused its discretion or how the circuit court's 
ruling prejudiced Plaintiffs. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Final Judgment filed by
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit on June 14, 2010 is
 affirmed.
