NO. 30591
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
AS, Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
 
WS, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D NO. 04-1-0002)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
In this divorce case, the Family Court of the Fifth 
Circuit (Family Court) entered a "Decree Granting Divorce and 
Awarding Child Custody" (Divorce Decree) on September 4, 2009. The Divorce Decree dissolved the marriage between Plaintiff-Appellant AS (Wife) and Defendant-Appellee WS (Husband); determined child custody, visitation, and support; determined spousal support; and divided and distributed the parties' property and debts. 
On November 13, 2009, Wife filed a "Motion 
to Vacate Decree Granting Divorce and Awarding Child Custody" (Motion to Vacate), pursuant to Hawai' i Family Court Rules (HFCR) 
Rule 60(b) (2006). The Family Court denied the Motion to Vacate and set forth its decision, along with supporting findings of fact and conclusions of law, in a consolidated June 4, 2010, "Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Defendant's Motions  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and Denying Plaintiff's Motion" (June 4, 2010, Order).1 Wife
 
appeals from the June 4, 2010, Order. 
On appeal, Wife argues that the Family Court erred in
 
denying her Motion to Vacate because: (1) "the [Divorce] Decree
 
was procured by fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct by
 Husband [and] Wife's reliance on Husband[']s misrepresentations
 constituted mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
 neglect[,]" which entitled her to relief pursuant to HFCR Rule
 60(b)(1) and (b)(3); (2) the Divorce Decree is void, entitling
 her to relief pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(4); and (3) the Divorce
 Decree is unconscionable, entitling her to relief pursuant to
 HFCR Rule 60(b)(6). We affirm.
 
I.
 
Husband and Wife were married in January 1992. Husband
 
brought substantial assets into the marriage, including real
 properties and his contracting equipment and cattle businesses. 
Husband and Wife separated on November 11, 2003, and Wife filed
 for divorce on January 8, 2004. Wife was initially represented
 by counsel, but stipulated to the withdrawal of her counsel on
 December 26, 2006, and proceeded pro se until she obtained
 counsel for the Motion to Vacate, which was filed on November 13,
 2009. While her divorce complaint was pending, Wife entered into
 stipulations with Husband, including stipulations for
 disbursement of martial funds and for the transfer of property to
 Husband or his trust in exchange for "substantial monies"
 received by Wife. Wife also acknowledged receiving money from
 Husband as advances to be deducted from her interest in the
 marital estate. 
On February 10, 2009, Husband filed a cross-complaint
 
for divorce. On May 18, 2009, Husband filed a "Motion to Set"
 along with a "Position Statement," which set forth his position
 regarding child custody, child and spousal support, and the
 division of the marital estate. In his Position Statement,
 
1
 The Honorable Max Graham, Jr., presided.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Husband, among other things, requested: (1) marriage partnership
 
credits for the substantial estate which he brought into the
 marriage and for the indebtedness Wife brought to the marriage;
 (2) marriage partnership credits for Wife's wasting of assets
 through excessive spending, which he claimed included significant
 gambling losses, since the parties' separation; (3) enforcement
 of all stipulations and agreements entered into by Wife regarding
 the distribution of the marital estate, including Wife's
 stipulation to transfer certain real property to Husband or his
 trust; (4) title to all other marital real property not covered
 by Wife's stipulation; (5) the award to Husband of his
 contracting equipment and cattle businesses; and (6) equalization
 payments from Wife. Husband served his Motion to Set and
 Position Statement on Wife. 
Wife did not file a pretrial position statement or
 
attend the hearing on the Motion to Set. The Family Court set
 the divorce trial for September 3, 2009. Despite being served
 
with notice of the trial date, Wife did not appear for trial. 
On September 4, 2009, the Family Court issued the
 
Divorce Decree, which in large part divided and distributed the
 
parties' property in accordance with Husband's requests in his
 Position Statement. On September 9, 2009, Husband sent a
 certified copy of the Divorce Decree to Wife by certified mail,
 which was returned unopened. On September 24, 2009, Husband sent
 a filed copy of the Divorce Decree to Wife by regular mail. Wife
 acknowledged receiving a copy of the Divorce Decree in the mail
 on September 25, 2009, and she contacted an attorney in late
 September 2009. Wife did not appeal from the Divorce Decree.
 
On November 13, 2009, Wife filed her Motion to Vacate. 
The Circuit Court denied Wife's Motion to Vacate and issued the
 June 4, 2010, Order. This appeal followed.
 
II.
 
On appeal, Wife contends that the Family Court erred in
 
denying Wife's Motion to Vacate, which sought to set aside the
 Divorce Decree, pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4),
 
3
   
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
and (b)(6). HFCR Rule 60(b) provides in relevant part:
 
(b) Mistakes; inadvertence; excusable neglect; newly
discovered evidence; fraud. On motion and upon such terms as
are just, the court may relieve a party or a party's legal
representative from any or all of the provisions of a final
judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;
. . . (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or
extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an
adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; . . . or (6) any
other reason justifying relief from the operation of the
judgment. 
We will not disturb the Family Court's denial of an HFCR Rule
 
60(b) motion absent an abuse of discretion. De Mello v. De
 
Mello, 3 Haw. App. 165, 169, 646 P.2d 409, 412 (1982).
 
We resolve Wife's arguments on appeal as follows: 
A.
 
Wife asserts that Husband procured the Divorce Decree
 
through fraud, misrepresentation, and other misconduct and that
 Wife's reliance on Husband's misrepresentations constituted
 mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. She
 
contends that the Family Court erred in failing to grant her
 
Motion to Vacate pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) and (b)(3). We
 disagree.
 
A moving party requesting relief under HFCR Rule 
60(b)(3) must "(1) prove by clear and convincing evidence that the [decree] was obtained through fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct, and (2) establish that the conduct complained of prevented the losing party from fully and fairly presenting [her] case or defense." See Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri 
Products, 86 Hawai' i 214, 252, 948 P.2d 1055, 1093 (1997) 
(internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted).
2 
With respect to relief under HFCR Rule 60(b)(1), the moving party 
2
 The court in Kawamata Farms addressed Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) Rule 60(b)(3) and relied upon cases construing Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure (FRCP) Rule 60(b)(3). See Kawamata Farms 86 Hawai' i at 252, 948
P.2d at 1093. HFCR 60(b) is substantially similar to HRCP Rule 60(b) and FRCPRule 60(b). Therefore, cases and treatises interpreting HRCP Rule 60(b) andFRCP Rule 60(b) are persuasive in interpreting HFCR Rule 60(b). Wagner v.
World Botanical Gardens, Inc., 126 Hawai' i 190, 194 n.3, 268 P.3d 443, 447 n.3
(App. 2011).

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"must make some showing of why [she] was justified in failing to
 
avoid mistake or inadvertence. Gross carelessness is not
 enough." Joaquin v. Joaquin, 5 Haw. App. 435, 443, 698 P.2d 298,
 
304 (1985)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
In support of her Motion to Vacate, Wife filed a
 
declaration asserting that Husband, through false and fraudulent
 promises and assurances, "led [her] to believe that he would give
 [her] a fair settlement in the divorce and that [she] could trust
 him to take care of 'the details.'"  Wife asserted that as a
 
result, she discharged her attorney and did not attend the
 
divorce trial. In response, Husband filed his own declaration
 denying Wife's allegations that he had engaged in fraud,
 misrepresentations, or misconduct that lulled her into
 discharging her attorney or failing to appear for the trial, and
 instead asserting that Wife was familiar with the judicial
 system, that Wife had become a "chronic gambler" and had "lost
 well in excess of $584,000" since their separation, and that
 "Wife did not participate in these proceedings because she knew
 that she had overspent her entitlement, not because of anything I
 said."
 
In denying Wife's Motion to Vacate, the Family Court
 
concluded that given the parties' conflicting statements and
 Wife's failure to provide any other evidence to support her
 allegations, Wife had "failed to show by clear and convincing
 evidence that her failure to appear at the Divorce Trial was the
 product of any fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct [by]
 Husband[.]" The Family Court ruled that Wife had failed to
 demonstrate her entitlement to relief under HFCR Rule 60(b)(3). 
The Family Court also concluded that once Wife was served with
 Husband's Position Statement, she could not have reasonably
 relied on any contrary statement Husband may have previously made
 concerning the division of their property and that she failed to
 show by a preponderance of the evidence that she was entitled to
 relief under HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) based on mistake, inadvertence,
 surprise, or excusable neglect.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Family Court's conclusions, which denied relief to 
Wife under HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) and (b)(3), are supported by the 
record and were well within the Family Court's discretion in light of the evidence presented. See Schefke v. Reliable 
Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai' i 408, 430-32, 32 P.3d 52, 74­
76 (2001); Joaquin, 5 Haw. App. at 443, 689 P.2d at 304. We cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion for the Family Court to deny Wife relief under HFCR Rule 60(b)(1) and (b)(3). See De Mello, 3 Haw. App. at 169, 646 P.2d at 412. 
B.
 
Wife argues that the Family Court erred in denying her
 
relief pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(4) because she claims the
 Divorce Decree was void. "[A] judgment is void only if the court
 that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the subject matter
 or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with
 due process of law." In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. 141, 146,
 
642 P.2d 938, 941 (1982). Wife acknowledges that the Family
 Court had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter. 
Nevertheless, she contends that the Family Court's significant
 failure to follow a partnership model property division or make
 findings justifying a deviation from that model rendered the
 Divorce Decree void as violative of due process. We conclude
 that Wife's claim under HFCR Rule 60(b)(4) is without merit. 
The record indicates that the Family Court considered
 
and applied partnership model principles in dividing the parties'
 property. The requested property division set forth in Husband's
 Position Statement, which the Family Court substantially adopted
 in the Divorce Decree, relied upon partnership model principles,
 and the Family Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law in
 the June 4, 2010, Order, reveal that the Family Court applied
 partnership model principles in dividing the property. Wife did
 not establish the basic premise of her argument, which is that
 the Family Court failed to follow partnership model principles in
 dividing the parties' property.
 
6
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The Family Court's property division might have been
 
more favorable to Wife if she had contested Husband's Position
 
Statement or submitted evidence contradicting the evidence
 presented by Husband at trial. However, Wife did not file her
 own pretrial position statement and did not appear or present
 evidence at the divorce trial, despite having the opportunity to
 do so. Wife has failed to demonstrate that her due process
 rights were violated or that the Divorce Decree was void. See 
In re Hana Ranch, 3 Haw. App. at 146-47, 642 P.2d at 941-42;
 Dillingham Inv. Corp. v. Kunio Yokoyama Trust, 8 Haw. App. 226,
 233, 797 P.2d 1316, 1320 (1990) (concluding in the context of a 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(4) motion that "the concept of [a] void judgment
 must be narrowly restricted" in order to protect the court's
 interest in the finality of its judgments (internal quotation
 marks and citation omitted)); see also Isemoto Contracting Co. v.
 Andrade, 1 Haw. App. 202, 206, 616 P.2d 1022, 1026 (1980) ("The
 principles of judicial economy and judicial finality operate as
 constraining influences upon the generosity of the courts in
 declaring judgments void."). 
C.
 
We reject Wife's contention that the Family Court erred
 
in denying her relief pursuant to HFCR Rule 60(b)(6) based on her
 claim that the Divorce Decree was unconscionable. In denying
 Wife's Motion to Vacate, the Family Court concluded in relevant
 part:
 
15. Based on the evidence presented by Husband at
the Divorce Trial concerning the values of the Real
Property, the prior funds distributed pursuant to the
Stipulations, Wife's waiver of her rights to the Stipulated
Real Property, the marriage partnership credits due to
Husband, the wasting of marriage assets by Wife through her
gambling, Husband's payments of Wife's gambling debts, and
Husband's distribution of funds to Wife prior to the Divorce
Trial, Husband made a prima facie case that the Divorce
 
Decree was fair and equitable.
 
16. It was the duty of Wife to attend the trial and
object to and/or offer evidence and arguments in opposition
to Husband's proposed award of the Real Property and other
assets as set forth in the Divorce Decree.
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
17. Wife has failed to show by a preponderance of
the evidence that there are facts or other reasons
 
supporting her claim that . . . she should be relieved from
the operation of the Divorce Decree pursuant to HFCR Rule
60(b). . . (6). 
The Family Court's conclusions were based on factual
 
findings that were supported by substantial evidence in the
 
record. We conclude that the Family Court did not abuse its
 discretion in denying relief to Wife under HFCR Rule 60(b)(6). 
See In re Hana Ranch, 3 Haw. App. at 147, 642 P.2d at 942;
 Hayashi, 4 Haw. App. at 290-91, 666 P.2d at 174-75.
