 The Honorable Derrick H.M. Chan presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
As explained below, the June 7, 2010 orders are not independently
 
appealable pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)
 (1993 & Supp. 2009) and Rule 34 of the Hawai
'i Probate Rules 
(HPR).
 
HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals from a probate
 
court's final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS
 § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules
 of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). The Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has 
promulgated HPR Rule 34, which generally requires the entry of a
 judgment for an appeal:
 
RULE 34. ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS, APPEALS
 
(a) Entry of Judgment. All formal testacy orders,
orders of intestacy and determination of heirs, orders
establishing conservatorship and/or guardianship, and orders
establishing protective arrangements shall be reduced to
judgment and the judgment shall be filed with the clerk of
the court. Such judgments shall be final and immediately
appealable as provided by statute. Any other order that
fully addresses all claims raised in a petition to which it
relates, but that does not finally end the proceeding, may
be certified for appeal in the manner provided by Rule 54(b)
of the Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure.
 
(b) Interlocutory Orders. In order to appeal from any
other order prior to the conclusion of the proceeding, the
order must be certified for appeal in accordance with
Section 641-1(b) of the Hawai'i Revised Statutes.
 
(c) Final Judgment Closing Proceeding. At the
 
conclusion of the proceeding, a final judgment closing the
proceeding shall be entered and filed with the clerk of the
court, at which time all prior uncertified interlocutory
orders shall become immediately appealable.
 
(d) Appeals. Final judgments as to all claims and
parties, certified judgments, certified orders, and other
orders appealable as provided by law may be appealed
pursuant to the Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure
applicable to civil actions.
 
HPR Rule 34 (emphases added). "Rule 34 is written to conform
 
probate practice to the policy against piecemeal appeals, see,
 e.g., Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Haw. 115, 869
 P.2d 1334, 1994 Haw. LEXIS 19 (1994), to bring certainty to the
 
-2­ 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
timing of when and how an appeal can be taken, and to comply with 
the provisions of HRS § 641-1.” Commentary to HPR Rule 34. Under the holding in Jenkins, "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 
119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. Therefore, under HRS § 641-1 and HPR Rule 34, a probate 
court order is eligible for appellate review only if the probate court either 
(a) reduces the order to a separate judgment pursuant to
HPR Rule 34(a), 
(b) certifies the order for appeal in the manner providedby Rule 54(b) of the Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP) pursuant to HPR Rule 34(a), or 
(c) certifies the order for appeal in accordance with HRS§ 641-1(b) pursuant to HPR Rule 34(b). 
The probate court has not reduced the three June 7, 2010 orders
 
to a separate judgment. The probate court has not certified the
 June 7, 2010 orders in the manner provided by HRCP Rule 54(b). 
The probate court has not certified the three June 7, 2010 orders
 for an interlocutory appeal in accordance with HRS § 641-1(b). 
Therefore, the June 7, 2010 orders are not eligible for appellate
 review pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) and HPR Rule 34.
 
Although common law exceptions to the final judgment
 
requirement exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848) (the
 
-3­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Forgay doctrine) and the collateral order doctrine, the June 7, 
2010 orders do not satisfy all of the requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine or the collateral order doctrine. See Ciesla v. Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 
702, 704 (1995) (regarding the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding 
the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine). 
Absent an appealable judgment or an appealable order
 
that satisfies the requirements for an appeal under HRS § 641-1
 and HPR Rule 34, this appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction. Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
