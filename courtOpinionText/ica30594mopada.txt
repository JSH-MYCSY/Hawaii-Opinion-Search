APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0007)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
In an appeal arising out of a foreclosure action,
 
Defendant-Appellant Avelina Salvacion (Salvacion) appeals from
 
three orders of the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit (circuit
 
1
court):  (1) an order dated June 2, 2010 denying Salvacion's
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 60(b) motion to set 
aside a September 3, 2009 judgment on a decree of foreclosure; 
1 The Honorable Randal G. B. Valenciano presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) an order dated July 1, 2010 granting Plaintiff-Appellee U.S.
 
Bank National Association's (U.S. Bank) motion to confirm the
 
sale of the foreclosed property; and (3) an order dated July 12,
 
2010 granting Salvacion's emergency motion for stay pending
 
appeal contingent upon Salvacion paying a supersedeas bond in the
 
amount of $693,805.34.
 
Salvacion presents three points of error on appeal,
 
which we summarize as follows. First, Salvacion asserts that the
 
circuit court erroneously granted U.S. Bank's motion for
 
confirmation of the foreclosure sale, in light of the alleged
 
fraud committed against Salvacion in the underlying mortgage
 
transaction and the alleged gross professional misconduct of
 
Salvacion's prior attorney. Second, Salvacion asserts that the
 
circuit court abused its discretion in denying her HRCP Rule
 
60(b) motion to set aside the September 3, 2009 judgment and
 
decree of foreclosure. In particular, Salvacion contends that in
 
denying her request for Rule 60(b)(6) relief the circuit court
 
erroneously misapplied a three-part test normally reserved for
 
setting aside default judgments. Third, Salvacion asserts that
 
the circuit court committed an abuse of discretion in requiring
 
her to post a supersedeas bond in the amount of $693,805.34 in
 
order to obtain a stay pending appeal, an amount she contends is
 
excessive.
 
After a careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted, having given due consideration to the arguments
 
advanced and the issues raised in this appeal, and for the
 
reasons set forth below, we conclude that the circuit court did
 
not properly exercise its discretion in addressing Salvacion's
 
HRCP Rule 60(b) motion to set aside the September 3, 2009
 
judgment. Specifically, with regard to the relief sought under
 
HRCP Rule 60(b)(6), the circuit court applied an incorrect legal
 
standard and thus we remand on this issue alone. We affirm the
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
circuit court's denial of the relief sought under subsections
 
(1) and (4) of HRCP Rule 60(b).
 
As to the other points of Salvacion's appeal, we do not
 
have jurisdiction over Salvacion's appeal of the circuit court's
 
July 1, 2010 order confirming the judicial foreclosure sale. 
Moreover, we conclude that the circuit court did not commit an
 
abuse of discretion in its setting of the supersedeas bond for
 
purposes of granting Salvacion's emergency motion for stay
 
pending appeal. However, given our ruling as to the HRCP Rule
 
60(b)(6) motion, we direct that further proceedings related to
 
the foreclosure be stayed pending the circuit court's further
 
ruling on the HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) motion.
 
I. Background
 
On August 3, 2006, Salvacion executed a promissory note 
to BNC Mortgage, Inc. for four-hundred fifty thousand dollars 
($450,000). The promissory note was secured by a mortgage on 
real property located at 672 Akalei Street, Ele 'ele, Kaua 'i, 
Hawai'i. The $450,000 was applied to what remained of the debt 
on Salvacion's existing mortgage, and Salvacion received the 
balance of the proceeds after closing costs. 
At some point thereafter, U.S. Bank acquired all
 
rights, title, and interest in the promissory note and mortgage
 
and is the current holder of both the promissory note and the
 
mortgage. Salvacion allegedly failed to honor the payments due
 
under the note, and, on December 17, 2007, U.S. Bank notified
 
Salvacion that she was in default of her loan obligation.
 
A. Circuit Court Proceedings
 
As a result of Salvacion's default on the payments owed
 
under the note, U.S. Bank filed a complaint in the circuit court
 
on January 15, 2009 seeking to foreclose upon the property. In
 
order to defend herself in the foreclosure action, Salvacion
 
employed the services of an attorney (hereafter "prior counsel"),
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
who, according to Salvacion, claimed to specialize in mortgage
 
issues. However, Salvacion asserts her prior counsel allegedly
 
did nothing to assist with her defense in the foreclosure action.
 
Salvacion asserts, without contradiction in the record, that her
 
prior counsel apparently tried to file an answer on her behalf in
 
the wrong judicial circuit, did not file any opposition to U.S.
 
Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment and for Decree of Foreclosure,
 
and then appeared telephonically without permission at the
 
summary judgment hearing. The circuit court ruled that the
 
misfiled answer would not be recognized. The circuit court
 
further granted U.S. Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment and
 
Decree of Foreclosure, explaining that Salvacion's prior counsel 
could file a motion for reconsideration. Prior counsel did not
 
file a reconsideration motion. Prior counsel also did not file a
 
notice of appeal from the foreclosure judgment entered on
 
September 3, 2009.
 
On December 4, 2009, a court appointed commissioner
 
conducted a foreclosure auction of Salvacion's home. The only
 
party in attendance and successful bidder at the auction was U.S.
 
Bank, which placed a single bid of $430,000. On January 22,
 
2010, U.S. Bank filed a motion for confirmation of the
 
foreclosure sale. 
B. Alleged Fraud in the Underlying Mortgage Transaction
 
On February 24, 2010, Salvacion's new counsel entered
 
an appearance in the case. For the first time, Salvacion's new
 
counsel asserted to the circuit court that gross fraud had
 
allegedly been committed against Salvacion in the underlying
 
mortgage transaction. Salvacion's new counsel filed both a
 
memorandum in opposition to U.S. Bank's confirmation motion as
 
well as a HRCP Rule 60(b) motion to set aside the foreclosure
 
judgment. Attached to both motions was a copy of Salvacion's
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
declaration outlining the alleged fraud that occurred in the
 
underlying mortgage transaction.
 
In her uncontested declaration, Salvacion stated in
 
relevant part:
 
3. In August of 2006, at the direction of mortgage
broker, James Lull of U.S. Financial Mortgage Corp. (an
unlicensed brokerage), I obtained a home refinance loan from
BNC Mortgage, Inc. in the amount of $450,000. . . .
 
. . . .
 7. Mr. Lull further induced me as part of the agreement
to transfer $72,000 of the proceeds to him as a short term
loan, which he explained would be used to help others
qualify for loans, and I would earn an easy profit.
Mr. Lull promised me that he would return the money in two
days along with an additional payment of $5,000.00, which as
Mr. Lull explained to me would further help me to make the
high monthly payments on the loan until such time as my
property value increased and the loan could be refinanced.
 
. . . .
 9. Mr. Lull, who not only received a substantial
commission as broker to the transaction, did not return my
$72,000.00 in proceeds as promised, nor did he pay me the
promised additional $5,000.00.
 
. . . .
 12. Mr. Lull was later indicted in Federal District Court,
and on September 16, 2008 pled guilty to defrauding clients
and investors, including myself, out of more than $30
million in what was discovered to be a Ponzi scheme . . . As
 one of the victims of Mr. Lull, I received several letters
regarding the Federal Court criminal case from the United
States Attorney [prosecuting the case.]
 13. I understand that Mr. Lull failed to appear for his
sentencing hearing in May of 2009, and was found dead on
May 14, 2009, having apparently committed suicide in
Washington State[.]
 
. . . .
 
On March 25, 2010, the circuit court announced that it
 
would grant confirmation of the sale, and it later entered its
 
order on July 1, 2010.
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
C. Salvacion's HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion and Hearing
 
On March 29, 2010, Salvacion filed a motion to set
 
aside the foreclosure judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b). The
 
motion was filed within one year of the circuit court's
 
September 3, 2009 judgment on the decree of foreclosure.
 
On April 29, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing on
 
Salvacion's Rule 60(b) motion. At the hearing, the circuit court
 
orally denied the motion, apparently rejecting all of Salvacion's
 
arguments. With regard to Salvacion's request for the relief
 
provided under subsection (6) of Rule 60(b), the circuit court
 
applied a three-part test usually reserved for setting aside
 
default judgments: 
THE COURT: There are certain requirements for a 60(b)(6)
type analysis to occur, and one is that the non-defaulting
party will not be prejudiced by the reopening; two is the
defaulting party has a meritorious defense; and three is
that the default will not result -- was not the result of
 inexcusable neglect or willful act.
 
. . . .
 So the question I have is how does the first factor not
prevent the Court's ruling on a 60(b)(6) analysis?
 
The circuit court thereafter entered its order denying
 
Salvacion's HRCP Rule 60(b) motion on June 2, 2010.
 
D. Instant Appeal
 
On July 1, 2010, Salvacion filed a notice of appeal
 
from (1) the circuit court's July 1, 2010 order granting U.S.
 
Bank's motion to confirm the sale of the foreclosed property, and
 
(2) the June 2, 2010 order denying Salvacion's HRCP Rule 60(b)
 
motion to set aside the September 3, 2009 foreclosure judgment. 
Salvacion thereafter filed a motion for stay pending
 
appeal in the circuit court, which the circuit court granted
 
contingent upon the posting of a supersedeas bond in the amount
 
of $693,805.34. On July 26, 2010 Salvacion filed a supplement to
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the notice of appeal, also appealing the circuit court's order 
regarding her motion for emergency stay. Apparently unable to 
post the bond, Salvacion filed a subsequent motion for an 
emergency stay in this court pursuant to Hawai 'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 8. On August 19, 2010, this court issued an order denying Salvacion's emergency motion for 
stay. 
II. Standards of Review
 
A. Denial of a HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion
 
The Hawai
'i Supreme Court has articulated the following 
standard of appellate review to be applied to a trial court's 
denial of a HRCP Rule 60(b) motion to set aside a judgment: 
It is well settled that the trial court has a very large
measure of discretion in passing upon motions under [Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)] Rule 60(b) and its orderwill not be set aside unless we are persuaded that under thecircumstances of the particular case, the court's refusal toset aside its order was an abuse of discretion. 
Hawai'i Hous. Auth. v. Uyehara, 77 Hawai 'i 144, 147, 883 P.2d 65, 
68 (1994) (brackets in original) (quoting Paxton v. State, 2 Haw. 
App. 46, 48, 625 P.2d 1052, 1054 (1981)). 
However, with respect to motions under HRCP Rule
 
60(b)(4), alleging that a judgment is void, this court has noted:
 
[t]he determination of whether a judgment is void is not a
discretionary issue. It has been noted that a judgment is
void only if the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction
of either the subject matter or the parties or otherwise
acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of law.
Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil §
2862 (1973). 
Citicorp Mortg., Inc. v. Bartolome, 94 Hawai 'i 422, 428, 16 P.3d 
827, 833 (App. 2000) (quoting In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App 
141, 146, 642 P.2d 938, 941 (1982)) (mortgagor's claim they had 
been fraudulently induced into refinancing their home was not 
grounds for vacating the judgment). Moreover, "[i]n the sound 
interest of finality, the concept of void judgment must be 
7

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
narrowly restricted." Id.  (internal quotation marks and citation
 
omitted).
 
B. Motion for Stay Pending Appeal
 
With regard to a circuit court's authority to determine
 
a supersedeas bond upon granting a stay pending appeal, the
 
Hawai'i Supreme Court has noted: 
The determination of the amount of a supersedeas bond which
will be sufficient to protect the rights of an appellee is
committed to the sound discretion of the circuit court, but
this discretion is not unlimited. Moreover, the bond
requirement may not be used to discourage appeals.

III. Discussion
 
A. 	Salvacion's HRCP Rule 60(b) Motion to Set Aside the
Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 
HRCP Rule 60(b) (2006) authorizes a court to set aside
 
a judgment in a civil case for the following reasons:
 
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could
not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial
 under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated
intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other
misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void;
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or
discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has
been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer
equitable that the judgment should have prospective
application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from
the operation of the judgment. 
HRCP Rule 60(b) further provides that "[t]he motion shall be made
 
within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not
 
more than one year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was
 
entered or taken." 
In the instant case, Salvacion filed her motion to set
 
aside the judgment pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b) within one year of
 
the circuit court's September 3, 2009 judgment on the decree of
 
foreclosure. Under subsection (1) of HRCP Rule 60(b), Salvacion
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
argued below that the circuit court should set aside the judgment
 
due to "excusable neglect" as the judgment on the decree of
 
foreclosure was due to the ineffective assistance of her prior
 
counsel. Salvacion also argued that because the underlying
 
mortgage transaction was the product of fraud, the circuit
 
court's judgment on the decree of foreclosure was void within the
 
meaning of subsection (4). Alternatively, Salvacion urged the
 
circuit court to set aside the judgment under the catch-all
 
provision of subsection (6) because of, inter alia, the gross
 
negligence of her prior counsel, and so that she has an
 
opportunity to present her case on the merits.
 
1. 	The Circuit Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in
 
Denying Salvacion's Motion Based on "Excusable
Neglect" under HRCP Rule 60(b)(1)
 
On appeal, Salvacion argues that the circuit court 
abused its discretion in not granting her motion to set aside the 
judgment due to "excusable neglect" under HRCP Rule 60(b)(1). 
Salvacion reasons that her "reliance on [prior counsel]'s 
representation was reasonable, and her failure to defend against 
the summary judgment based upon such reliance clearly amounts to 
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect." The 
general rule is that the neglect of a party's attorney will be 
imputed to the party for purposes of a motion for relief from 
judgment on grounds of excusable neglect. See, e.g., Carroll v. 
Abbott Labs., Inc., 32 Cal.3d 892, 898 (1982). Hawai
'i case law 
is consistent with this principle. See Isemoto Contracting Co. 
v. Andrade, 1 Haw. App. 202, 204, 616 P.2d 1022, 1025 (1980)
 (carelessness of counsel is not grounds for relief under HRCP
 
Rule 60(b)(1)). Accordingly, in order to obtain relief for
 
ineffective assistance of counsel under subsection (1), a party
 
must demonstrate that her counsel's negligence was excusable
 
within the meaning of the rule.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In the instant case, Salvacion presented no evidence
 
excusing her prior counsel's neglect. Accordingly, the circuit
 
court did not abuse its discretion in denying Salvacion's HRCP
 
Rule 60(b) motion to the extent that it was based on "excusable
 
neglect" within the meaning of subsection (1).
 
2. 	The Circuit Court did not Err in Denying
Salvacion's Motion on Grounds that the Judgment
was "Void" Pursuant to HRCP Rule 60(b)(4)
 
This court has noted that "a judgment is void only if 
the court that rendered it lacked jurisdiction of either the 
subject matter or the parties or otherwise acted in a manner 
inconsistent with due process of law." Bartolome, 94 Hawai
'i at 
428, 16 P.3d at 833 (quoting In re Hana Ranch Co., 3 Haw. App. at 146, 642 P.2d at 941-42). Salvacion argues that the circuit 
court's judgment on the decree of foreclosure is "void" within 
the meaning of HRCP Rule 60(b)(4), in light of the alleged fraud 
and deceptive practices committed in the underlying mortgage 
transaction. Relying on HRS § 480-12 (2008 Repl.), Salvacion 
asserts that the "underlying mortgage loan in this case involved 
numerous unfair and deceptive acts and practices, as well as 
gross criminal fraud, each of which legally nullify the 
underlying mortgage loan agreement, rendering it unenforceable by 
any Court[.]" 
In Bartolome, the appellants made a similar argument. 
This court, however, was unpersuaded:
 
we question whether Appellants properly brought their TILA
and HRS ch. 480 issues under HRCP Rule 60(b)(4). That
subsection applies only where the trial court lacked
jurisdiction of either the subject matter or the parties or
otherwise acted in a manner inconsistent with due process of
law. A determination under those laws that the note and
 mortgage were void and unenforceable, as Appellants urge,
would not oust personal or subject matter jurisdiction. If
it did, then the trial court would be ipso facto without
 
jurisdiction to grant Appellants their relief.
 
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 434, 16 P.3d at 839 (citation and quotation marks
 
omitted). The reasoning in Bartolome controls this issue. 
Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in denying Salvacion's
 
HRCP Rule 60(b) motion to the extent it asserted that the
 
judgment was void within the meaning of subsection (4).
 
3.	 Exceptional Circumstances: Salvacion's Claim under
the "catch-all" provision of HRCP Rule 60(b)(6)
 
As this court has noted, "HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) permits 
the court in its sound discretion to relieve a party from a final 
judgment for 'any other reason justifying relief from the 
operation of the judgment.'" Isemoto Contracting, 1 Haw. App. at 
205, 616 P.2d at 1025. "HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) provides for extraordinary relief and is only invoked upon a showing of 
exceptional circumstances." Uyehara, 77 Hawai
'i at 148, 883 P.2d 
at 69 (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). "To qualify for relief under HRCP 60(b)(6), the motion 
must be based upon some reason other than those stated in clauses 
(1)-(5)." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Salvacion's HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) claim was premised in 
large measure on the alleged gross negligence of her prior 
counsel. Under a system where an attorney's neglect is imputed 
to the client, a claim of gross negligence on the part of counsel 
is in essence a claim of inexcusable neglect and thus 
fundamentally distinct from a claim of excusable neglect within 
the meaning of Rule 60(b)(1). "[W]hen an attorney's neglect is 
gross and inexcusable courts have held that relief may be 
justified under Rule 60(b)(6)." Uyehara, 77 Hawai
'i at 149, 883 
P.2d at 70 (quoting Chang v. Smith, 778 F.2d 83, 85 (1st Cir. 1985)); see also Isemoto Contracting, 1 Haw. App. at 205-06, 616 
P.2d at 1025-26 (analyzing a claim of inexcusable attorney 
neglect under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6)); Fuller v. Quire, 916 F.2d 358, 
361 (6th Cir. 1990) (inexcusable neglect does not fall within the 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ambit of Rule 60(b)(1)); Boughner v. Sec'y of Health, Educ. and
 
Welfare, 572 F.2d 976 (3rd Cir. 1978). Accordingly, Salvacion's
 
claim for relief premised on the gross negligence of her prior
 
counsel was properly brought under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6).
 
The question, then, is whether the circuit court abused 
its discretion in applying the three-part test typically reserved 
for setting aside default judgments in denying Salvacion's HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(6) claim. With regard to the standard for a trial 
court to employ in exercising its discretion under HRCP Rule 
60(b)(6), this court has noted that subsection (6) provides for 
"extraordinary relief and is only invoked upon a showing of 
exceptional circumstances." Isemoto Contracting, 1 Haw. App. at 
205, 616 P.2d at 1025 (citations omitted); see also City and County of Honolulu v. Bennett, 2 Haw. App. 180, 183, 627 P.2d 
1136, 1139 (1981) (in order to get relief under HRCP Rule 
60(b)(6) based on the gross negligence of counsel, the movant 
must demonstrate "extreme aggravation with respect to the conduct 
of counsel.") Moreover, "[a] party seeking relief under HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(6) after the time of appeal has run must establish the 
existence of 'extraordinary circumstances' that prevented or 
rendered him unable to prosecute an appeal." Uyehara, 77 Hawai
'i 
at 148-49, 883 P.2d at 69-70 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
There are at least three published Hawai
'i cases 
analyzing the denial of an appellant's motion to set aside a 
judgment in a civil case due to the alleged misconduct or 
negligence of counsel under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6). In Uyehara, the 
Hawai'i Supreme Court addressed a trial court's denial of a HRCP 
Rule 60(b)(6) motion made more than three years after the entry of judgment. 77 Hawai
'i at 149, 883 P.2d at 70. The appellant 
argued that his counsel's failure to obtain his consent in settling the case constituted gross and inexcusable neglect such 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
that it amounted to an exceptional circumstance warranting relief 
under Rule 60(b)(6). Id. at 150, 883 P.2d at 71. The Hawai 'i 
Supreme Court disagreed. In addition to holding that the motion was untimely and properly denied, the court found that the 
appellant had ratified the settlement agreement by trying to 
enforce it. Id. at 151, 883 P.2d at 72. Accordingly, the court 
stated "[w]e need not, therefore, decide whether [counsel]'s failure to obtain [appellant]'s express consent constituted gross 
and inexcusable neglect inasmuch as [appellant] subsequently 
ratified the settlement." Id. 
This court has also addressed two cases in which the
 
alleged misconduct or negligence of counsel was asserted as
 
grounds for vacating a judgment under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6). In
 
Isemoto Contracting, we held that counsel's alleged failure to
 
raise compulsory counterclaims was not an exceptional
 
circumstance warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(6). 1 Haw. App.
 
at 206, 616 P.2d at 1026. Likewise, a year later in Bennett, we
 
held that the alleged failure of counsel to present certain
 
evidence at a civil trial did not warrant relief under HRCP Rule
 
60(b)(6).
2 2 Haw. App at 183, 627 P.2d at 1139. We reasoned:
 
It might be that a case could arise of such extreme
aggravation with respect to the conduct of counsel that a
trial court, in its discretion, would set aside a judgment
in a civil case under Rule 60(b)(6). There is nothing in
this record to reflect that there were such aggravated
circumstances; that counsel was, in fact, ineffective; or
that the court below, in any way, abused its discretion in
denying the motions under appeal.
 
Id.; see also Fuller, 916 F.2d at 361 (after considering the
 
broad equities of the case, appellate court held that the trial
 
judge properly granted the plaintiff relief under Federal Rules
 
2
 In both Isemoto Contracting and Bennett, there had been a trial and
 
then an HRCP Rule 60(b) motion to vacate judgment. "Generally, relief granted
under HRCP Rule 60(b) has been confined to those cases where either a default
judgment or dismissal has been entered, reflecting a historical preference for
cases to be decided in a trial on their substantive merits." Isemoto
 
Contracting, 1 Haw. App. at 205, 616 P.2d at 1025 (citation omitted).
 
13
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
of Civil Procedure (FRCP) Rule 60(b)(6) for the inexcusable
 
misconduct of his attorney); Boughner, 572 F.2d at 978 (summary
 
judgments were vacated under FRCP Rule 60(b)(6) due to the gross
 
neglect of parties' prior attorney).
 
In the instant case, the undisputed facts presented to
 
the circuit court were: Salvacion employed the assistance of an
 
attorney to defend her in the foreclosure lawsuit; her prior
 
counsel filed an answer to U.S. Bank's complaint in the wrong
 
judicial circuit and therefore it was not recognized by the
 
circuit court; her prior counsel did not file any opposition to
 
U.S. Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment and decree of
 
foreclosure, and appeared telephonically without permission at
 
the summary judgment hearing; after the circuit court granted
 
U.S. Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment, Salvacion's prior
 
counsel failed to file a motion for reconsideration despite the
 
circuit court's specific invitation to do so; prior counsel did
 
not file a notice of appeal from the HRCP Rule 54(b) judgment
 
entered on September 3, 2009; prior counsel failed to inform
 
Salvacion of the circuit court's judgment on the decree of
 
foreclosure until the court-appointed commissioner attempted to
 
hold an open house in preparation for the judicial foreclosure
 
sale. 
In addressing the Rule 60(b)(6) aspect of Salvacion's
 
motion, the circuit court did not apply the legal standard of
 
whether there were "exceptional circumstances" warranting the
 
extraordinary relief available under HRCP 60(b)(6). Rather, a
 
review of the transcript reveals that the circuit court instead 
applied a three-part test usually reserved for setting aside
 
default judgments:3

 We note that, even in applying the three-part test applicable to
default judgments, the circuit court misconstrued the first part of the test
regarding prejudice to the nondefaulting party due to reopening of a case. As

THE COURT: There are certain requirements for a 60(b)(6)
type of analysis to occur, and one is that the non-
defaulting party will not be prejudiced by the reopening;
two is the defaulting party has a meritorious defense; and
three is that the default will not result -- was not the
 result of inexcusable neglect or willful act.
 
. . . .
 
So the question I have is how does the first factor not
prevent the Court's ruling on a 60(b)(6) analysis
?
 
In this case, there was no default judgment. 
Therefore, under
 
Isemoto Contracting, Uyehara and Bennett, the proper legal
 
standard to address the alleged gross misconduct of Salvacion's
 
prior counsel was whether there were "exceptional circumstances"
 
warranting the extraordinary relief available under HRCP Rule
 
60(b)(6). Because the circuit court failed to apply the correct
 
legal standard, we vacate that portion of the circuit court's
 
order denying relief under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) and remand the case
 
back to the circuit court to determine whether Salvacion
 
demonstrated exceptional circumstances sufficient to warrant
 
relief from the foreclosure judgment under HRCP Rule 60(b)(6). 
In addressing this issue on remand, the circuit court may allow
 
further briefing and a further hearing as it deems appropriate.
 
B. 	The Circuit Court's July 1, 2010 Order Confirming the
Sale of the Foreclosed Property
 
The circuit court's July 1, 2010 order granting U.S.
 
Bank's motion to confirm the sale of the foreclosed property is
 
not an appealable order. HRS § 667-51(a)(2) (Supp. 2010)
 
authorizes a party in a foreclosure action to assert an appeal
 
3(...continued)
explained in 
BDM, Inc. v. Sageco, Inc., 57 Haw. 73, 76, 549 P.2d 1147, 1150
(1976), "[t]he mere fact that the nondefaulting party will be required to
prove his case without the inhibiting effect of the default upon the
defaulting party does not constitute prejudice which should prevent a
reopening."
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
from a judgment on a decree of foreclosure.4 However, HRS § 667­
51(a)(2) does not authorize the appeal from the order confirming
 
the sale of foreclosed property in this case. The circuit court
 
has not reduced the July 1, 2010 order to a separate HRCP Rule
 
54(b) certified judgment, as set forth in HRS § 667-51(a)(2).
 
The July 1, 2010 order granting U.S. Bank's motion to
 
confirm the sale of the foreclosed property is also not
 
appealable pursuant to HRS § 641-1(a) (Supp. 2010), a statute of
 
more general application that authorizes appeals from "final
 
judgments, orders, or decrees[.]" In its application of HRS
 
§ 641-1(a) to foreclosure cases, the Hawai 'i Supreme Court has 
noted that an appeal from "matters subsequent to the foreclosure
 decree, such as the confirmation of sale . . . have to wait until
 
entry of the circuit court's final order in the case." 
Beneficial Haw., Inc. v. Casey, 98 Hawai
'i 159, 165, 45 P.3d 359, 
365 (2002) (citation omitted). The July 1, 2010 order confirming
 
4 [§ 667-51] Appeals.  (a) Without limiting the class of
orders not specified in section 641-1 from which appeals may also
be taken, the following orders entered in a foreclosure case shall
be final and appealable:
(1) 	A judgment entered on a decree of foreclosure,
and if the judgment incorporates an order of
sale or an adjudication of a movant's right to a
deficiency judgment, or both, then the order of
sale or the adjudication of liability for the
deficiency judgment also shall be deemed final
and appealable;
(2) 	A judgment entered on an order confirming
the sale of the foreclosed property, if
the circuit court expressly finds that no
just reason for delay exists, and
certifies the judgment as final pursuant
to rule 54(b) of the Hawaii rules of civil
procedure; and
 
(3) 	A deficiency judgment; provided that no
appeal from a deficiency judgment shall
raise issues relating to the judgment
debtor's liability for the deficiency
judgment (as opposed to the amount of the
deficiency judgment), nor shall the appeal
affect the finality of the transfer of
title to the foreclosed property pursuant
to the order confirming sale.
(Emphasis added.)
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the sale of the foreclosed property contemplates the possible
 
entry of other orders and also indicates a likely deficiency, and
 
is therefore not the last and final order in this foreclosure
 
case. Consequently, the July 1, 2010 order confirming the sale
 
of the foreclosed property is not an appealable order under
 
either HRS § 641-1(a) or HRS § 667-51(a)(2).
 
C. 	The Circuit Court's July 12, 2010 Order Granting
Salvacion's Emergency Motion for Stay Pending Appeal
 
As we previously noted in denying Salvacion's motion 
for emergency stay brought pursuant to HRAP Rule 8, Salvacion 
fails to demonstrate that the circuit court abused its discretion 
in setting a supersedeas bond in the amount of $693,805.34.5 The 
amount of a bond sufficient to protect the rights of an appellee 
is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. 
Midkiff, 58 Haw. at 550, 574 P.2d at 131. A court has the 
inherent discretion and power to allow for flexibility on the 
determination of the nature and extent of the security required 
to stay execution of a judgment pending appeal and can allow an 
alternative to a supersedeas bond. Shanghai Inv., Co. v. Alteka 
Co., 92 Hawai 'i 482, 503, 993 P.2d 516, 537 (2000), overruled on 
other grounds by Blair v. Ing, 96 Hawai 'i 327, 31 P.3d 184 
(2001). However, the burden to provide a secure alternative 
rests on the judgment debtor. Id. (citation omitted). 
In the instant case, Salvacion sought the stay by
 
offering monthly rental payments during the pendency of the
 
appeal as security, while she remained in possession of the
 
property. Further Salvacion rejected the circuit court's
 
suggested alternative of a lower supersedeas bond, along with
 
5 In her briefings to this court, Salvacion asserts that a single judge
of this court denied her motion for a stay and that she is entitled to have a
full panel of this court review the issue on appeal. Salvacion's assertion,
however, is erroneous. A full three-judge panel of this court considered the
motion as indicated in footnote 1 of our August 19, 2010 Order.
 
17

rental payments. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude
 
that the circuit court abused its discretion in granting the stay
 
conditioned on a supersedeas bond of $693,805.34. Accordingly,
 
we affirm the circuit court's July 12, 2010 order granting
 
Salvacion's emergency motion for stay pending appeal.
 
IV. Conclusion
 
For the aforementioned reasons, with regard to the
 
circuit court's June 2, 2010 order denying Salvacion's request
 
for HRCP Rule 60(b) relief, we affirm the circuit court's denial
 
of relief under subsections (1) and (4), but remand for further
 
proceedings on Salvacion's claim for relief under the catch-all
 
provision of subsection (6). We also affirm the circuit court's
 
July 12, 2010 order granting Salvacion's emergency motion for
 
stay pending appeal.
 
Given our ruling as to the HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) issue,
 
further proceedings as to the foreclosure shall be stayed pending
 
the circuit court's ruling on the HRCP Rule 60(b)(6) issue on
 
remand.
