APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CIVIL NO. 03-1-1126)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Upon review of the record, it appears that this court
 
does not have jurisdiction over Appellant Soprema Inc.'s
 
(Appellant Soprema) appeal from the Honorable Patrick W. Border's
 June 8, 2010 "Order Denying Defendant and Third Party Plaintiff
 Soprema Inc.'s Motion to (1) File a First Amended Third Party
 Complaint against Third Party Defendant American Permaquik Inc.,
 (2) Name Additional Third Party Defendants, and (3) Substitute Tremco Incorporated for Defendant American Permaquik Inc." (the June 8, 2010 order). The June 8, 2010 order is an interlocutory order, is not independently appealable, and the circuit court has not yet entered an appealable final judgment on all claims pursuant to Rule 58 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure 
(HRCP). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 
2009) authorizes appeals to the intermediate court of appeals only from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Based on HRCP Rule 58, the Supreme Court of Hawai
'i has ruled 
that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 
Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). "An appeal from an 
order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted). 
The circuit court has not yet entered a separate judgment in this 
case. Absent a separate judgment, the June 8, 2010 order is not eligible for appellate review. 
Although exceptions to the final judgment requirement 
exist under Forgay v. Conrad, 47 U.S. 201 (1848)(the Forgay doctrine), the collateral order doctrine, and HRS § 641-1(b), the June 8, 2010 order does not satisfy the requirements for appealability under any of these exceptions. See Ciesla v. 
Reddish, 78 Hawai
'i 18, 20, 889 P.2d 702, 704 (1995) (regarding 
the two requirements for appealability under the Forgay doctrine); Abrams v. Cades, Schutte, Fleming & Wright, 88 Hawai
'i 
319, 322, 966 P.2d 631, 634 (1998) (regarding the three requirements for appealability under the collateral order doctrine); HRS § 641-1(b) (regarding the requirements for an appeal from an interlocutory order). With respect to the Forgay and collateral order doctrines, we note in particular that the June 8, 2010 order does not subject a party such as Appellant Soprema to irreparable injury that is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. See, e.g., Takayama v. Financial 
Sec. Ins. Co., Ltd., 79 Hawai
'i 98, 101, 898 P.2d 610, 613 (App. 
1995) (holding that an order that denies a party's motion for substitution of a party is not final and appealable). We additionally note that the circuit court did not certify the June 8, 2010 order for an interlocutory appeal pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b). Therefore, the June 8, 2010 order is not an appealable order.

Absent an appealable separate judgment, Appellant
 
Soprema's appeal is premature, and we lack appellate jurisdiction
 
over appellate court case number 30595. Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
