NO. 30596
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I 
CHRIS GRINDLING, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI'I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT

 
WAILUKU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. D.C. - S.P. 09-1-0003)
 
ORDER DENYING OCTOBER 21, 2010 MOTION TO

DISMISS APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION OR, IN
THE ALTERNATIVE, MOTION TO STRIKE OPENING BRIEF
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Respondent-Appellee State of
 
Hawaii's (Appellee State) October 21, 2010 motion to dismiss for
 
lack of jurisdiction or, in the alternative, motion to strike
 
opening brief (October 21, 2010 motion), (2) the November 3, 2010
 
memorandum that Petitioner-Appellant Chris Grindling (Appellant
 
Grindling), pro se, filed in opposition to Appellee State's
 
October 21, 2010 motion, and (3) the record, we deny Appellee
 
State's October 21, 2010 motion.
 
Appellant Grindling sought post-conviction relief from 
a district court judgment of conviction pursuant to Rule 40 of 
the Hawai 'i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). Appellant Grindling 
has appealed from the Honorable Rhonda I.L. Loo's May 17, 2010  "Order Denying Petitioner's Motion to Transfer Petition to 
Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Judgment to Circuit Court and 
Dismissing Petitioner's Petition to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct 
Judgment" (the May 17, 2010 district court order). Appellee 
State argues that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction because 
Appellant Grindling's appeal from the May 17, 2010 district court 
order was untimely under Rule 4(b) of the Hawai 'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP). We note that, although the file-stamped date of Appellant Grindling's notice of appeal is July 7, 
2010, the district court clerk stamped Appellant Grindling's 
notice of appeal with a receipt date of June 3, 2010. 
"[P]ursuant to HRAP Rule 4(b), an appeal from an order 
denying post-conviction relief must either be filed within thirty 
days after the entry of the order denying the HRPP Rule 40 
petition or, in the alternative, after the announcement but 
before the entry of the order." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai
'i 
10, 13, 897 P.2d 937, 940 (1995). Although the July 7, 2010 file-stamped date on Appellant Grindling's notice of appeal 
conflicts with the district court clerk's June 3, 2010 stamped 
date of receipt for Appellant Grindling's notice of appeal, the 
date on which the district court received the document prevails 
over the subsequent file-stamped date that the court eventually 
put on the document. Cf. Doe v. Doe, 98 Hawai
'i 144, 151, 44 
P.3d 1085, 1092 (2002). Thus, the June 3, 2010 effective date of Appellant Grindling's notice of appeal was within the thirty-day 
time period after entry of the May 17, 2010 district court order, 
as HRAP Rule 4(b) required. Therefore, Appellant Grindling's 
appeal is timely. 
Appellee State alternatively moves this court to strike
 
Appellant Grindling's opening brief because it does not conform
 
to HRAP Rule 28(b). Appellant Grindling is not an attorney, but,
 
instead, a pro se prisoner. In light of these circumstances, we
 
deny Appellee State's alternative motion to strike Appellant
 
Grindling's opening brief. Accordingly,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellee State's October 21,
 
2010 motion is denied.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai 'i, November 24, 2010.
