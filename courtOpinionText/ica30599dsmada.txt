NO. 30599
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI» I 
AMERICAN EXPRESS CENTURION BANK, Plaintiff-Appellee,  v.
SOLOMON NALUA» I, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC09-1-1148)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we do not
 
have jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-Appellant
 
Solomon D. Nalua» i (Appellant) has asserted from the May 20, 2010 
judgment, because Appellant s appeal appears to be untimely under
 
Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai» i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP). 
Pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a)
 
(1993 & Supp. 2009),
 
appeals are allowed in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts. In district court cases , a judgment includes any
order from which an appeal lies. A final order means an
 
order ending the proceeding, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. When a written judgment, order, or decree
ends the litigation by fully deciding all rights and
liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing further to be
adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is final and
appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142 , 91 Hawai» i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI » I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted; emphases added). The May 20, 2010 judgment fully 
decides all the rights and liabilities of the parties, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated. Therefore, the May 20, 2010 judgment is an appealable final judgment pursuant to HRS § 641­1(a). 
However, Appellant did not file his June 22, 2010
 
notice of appeal within thirty days after entry of the May 20,
 2010 judgment, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) requires. Therefore,
 Appellant s appeal in appellate court case number 30599 is
 untimely. The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 
of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin , 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 
justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 
contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is dismissed for
 
lack of jurisdiction.
