SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Foley and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Defendant-Appellant Solomon Nalua 'i (Nalua 'i), appearing 
pro se, appeals from the May 20, 2010, Judgment entered in favor 
of Plaintiff-Appellee American Express Centurion Bank (American Express) by the District Court of the First Circuit (District Court).
1 American Express filed a complaint seeking to recover 
$11,825.50 allegedly owed by Nalua 'i on a credit card account. 
The District Court granted American Express's motion for summary judgment and issued the Judgment for $12,500.50, which included principal, attorney's fees, and costs. 
1 The Honorable Hilary B. Ganges presided over the
proceedings relevant to this appeal.

I. 
On appeal, Nalua 'i asserts the following points of 
error: 
1. The Court erred in ignoring Defendant's Notice of
Appeal In Forma Pauperis, denying Ex Parte Application For
Relief From Costs and denying Motion For Leave To Proceed On
Appeal In Forma Pauperis.
 
2. The Court erred in accepting Appellee's Notice of
Submission, and Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for
Summary Judgment, as well as the Courts Notice of Entry of
Judgment or Order, and Judgment filed nearly five (5) months
and eight (8) months respectively past the judges decision
and announcement to grant said Summary Judgment.
 
3. The Court erred in Dismissing Appellant's Appeal
for Lack of Jurisdiction.
 
4. The Court erred in granting Summary Judgment in
favor of Appellee, although notwithstanding, there is no
contract between the parties.
 
5. The Court erred in the conduct of its judicial
procedures and the manner in which it conducted its courts
actions and reactions towards a Sui juris (Pro se)
Appellant.
 
As discussed below, we affirm the District Court's Judgment.
 
II. 
We resolve Nalua 'i's points of error as follows: 
1. Points of error (1) and (3) are primarily directed 
at actions taken by this Court. 
These points do not provide a 
basis for appealing the District Court's Judgment and are 
irrelevant to the merits of Nalua 'i's appeal. 
Nalua'i apparently filed on October 19, 2009, a 
"Defendant's Notice of Appeal in Forma Pauperis" (First Notice of Appeal), which was not included in the original record on appeal. Unaware of this First Notice of Appeal, this Court issued an "Order Dismissing Appeal for Lack of Jurisdiction" based on the untimeliness of a second notice of appeal that Nalua
'i filed on 
June 22, 2010. We subsequently, however, granted Nalua 'i's 
motion for reconsideration and vacated our order dismissing the appeal after Nalua
'i brought the First Notice of Appeal to our 
attention. Thus, any error in our original dismissal of Nalua
'i's appeal had been remedied.

As to Nalua 'i's motion to this Court for leave to 
proceed on appeal in forma pauperis (In Forma Pauperis Motion), 
we issued an order which noted that Nalua 'i had already paid the 
filing fee and which denied his motion without prejudice to his seeking reimbursement for costs if he prevails on appeal. Nalua
'i attached to his In Forma Pauperis Motion, an "Ex Parte 
Application for Relief from Costs" (Ex Parte Application) that was denied by the District Court. Nalua
'i filed the Ex Parte 
Application in the District Court on July 7, 2010, which was after the District Court's Judgment and both of Nalua
'i's notices 
of appeal. Because the District Court's denial of the Ex Parte Application was not included in any notice of appeal filed by Nalua
'i in this appeal, we lack jurisdiction to consider such 
denial. 
2. As to point of error (2), the District Court did 
not err in accepting American Express's proposed order granting American Express's motion for summary judgment five months after the District Court's oral ruling on the motion was issued or in filing the Judgment eight months after the District Court's oral ruling. The delays in the preparation of the order granting American Express's motion for summary judgment and in the entry of the Judgment do not provide any basis for Nalua
'i to obtain 
relief from the Judgment entered. 
3. As to point of error (4), the District Court did 
not err in granting American Express's motion for summary judgement. American Express established that there was no genuine issue of material fact and that Nalua
'i was obligated to 
pay the amounts due on his credit card account as a matter of law. See Grasso v. First USA Bank, 713 A.2d 304, 309 (Del. Sup. 
Ct. 1998); Jones v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., 235 S.W.3d 333, 338-39 (Tex. Ct. App. 2007). 
4. As to point of error (5), we reject Naula
'i's 
claim that the District Court committed error in the conduct of the proceedings. That claim is without merit.
