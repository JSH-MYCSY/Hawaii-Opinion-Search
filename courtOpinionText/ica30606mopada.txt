APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff-Appellant Emerson M. F. Jou, M.D. (Jou)
 
appeals from rulings by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
1
(circuit court)  in two separate but related underlying cases. 
In appellate case no. 30606, Jou appeals from an "Order Granting
 
Defendant HEMIC's Motion to Enforce Settlement" filed on June 15,
 2010 (June 15 Order), in Civil No. 03–1-1445.
2 In appellate case
 
no. 30607, Jou appeals from a Judgment filed on July 8, 2010, in
 Civil No. 09-1-1529, which was entered pursuant to an "Order
 Granting Defendant HEMIC's Motion to Enforce Settlement by
 Dismissing Action", filed June 16, 2010 (June 16 Order). 
Appellate cases no. 30606 and no. 30607 have been consolidated by
 this court.
 
On appeal, Jou contends that the circuit court erred
 
by: (1) enforcing a handwritten memorandum as a settlement
 agreement because a condition therein was later waived by HEMIC;
 (2) concluding that unknown claims were released; (3) ruling
 that, even if the fraud claim accrued after the settlement
 agreement, a fraud claim does not exist; (4) dismissing Jou's
 suit for settlement fraud and related torts; (5) not recognizing
 that HEMIC had a duty to disclose a judgment lien in a settlement
 conference; and (6) finding Jou at fault for not performing a
 title search before a settlement conference.
 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm as to Civil
 
No. 03–1-1445 and vacate as to Civil No. 09-1-1529.
 
I. Background
 
In Civil No. 03–1-1445, Jou brought suit against HEMIC
 
and other defendants for inter alia insurer bad faith. 
Ultimately, the circuit court and this court entered judgments
 
1
 The Honorable Gary W. B. Chang presided in both cases.

 The June 15 Order is an appealable order under the collateral order
doctrine. Cook v. Surety Life Ins., Co., 79 Hawai' i 403, 408, 903 P.2d 708,
713 (App. 1995) ("we hold that an order enforcing a settlement agreement is a
collateral order which is appealable.").

(Fees/Cost Judgments)  awarding HEMIC attorneys' fees and costs
against Jou in the total amount of $
19,045.40. In an effort to
 
compromise the amounts owed by Jou to HEMIC, a settlement
 
conference was held with the circuit court on May 4, 2009. Jou,
 HEMIC and the court signed a handwritten memorandum (5/4/09
 
4
Memo) memorializing the agreements reached that day.  The 5/4/09
 
Memo appears to contemplate that a release and indemnity
 agreement (R&IA) would thereafter be executed, but an R&IA was
 not executed.
 
Jou contends that when he sought to obtain a loan, he
 
learned that HEMIC had recorded the Fees/Cost Judgments in the
 Bureau of Conveyances in September 2008 as a lien against his
 property. 
Jou thus filed a complaint on July 6, 2009, and an
 
amended complaint on July 9, 2009, initiating the action in Civil
 No. 09-1-1529 and asserting claims denominated as: tortious
 judgment lien; settlement fraud; settlement fraud (non disclosure
 making partial disclosure false); intentional infliction of
 emotional distress; and negligence.
 
On February 19, 2010, HEMIC filed a "Motion to Enforce
 
Settlement" in Civil No. 03–1-1445 and a "Motion To Enforce
 Settlement By Dismissing Action" in Civil No. 09-1-1529. The
 circuit court held consolidated hearings on both motions. In
 
3 The two judgments are a circuit court "Judgment" in Civ. No. 03-1­
1445-07, filed April 22, 2005, which awarded HEMIC $8,750 in fees and $833.20
in costs, and a "Judgment for Fees and Costs" entered by this court in the
same matter on appeal, No. 27281, awarding $9,395 in fees and $67.20 in costs.

 The document states:
 
1. $8,000 (Jou - HEMIC) 
2. Jou global release & indemnity (& dismissal)
-incl. class DCD appeal vs. HEMIC
of all claims accrued to date of R&IA
 
3. Jou & related providers * initiate administrative,
judicial, or other proceeding for 10 yrs after R&IAexecuted, arising out of SVS provided by Jou or relatedproviders (incl. Employers) 
4. Stip dismiss all

Civil No. 03–1-1445, the court issued its June 15 Order enforcing
 
the settlement set forth in the 5/4/09 Memo. In Civil No. 09-1­1529, the circuit court issued its June 16 Order and the
 Judgment, which dismissed that action based in part on the
 settlement set forth in the 5/4/09 Memo.
II. Valid Settlement Agreement and Release
 
In his first point of error, Jou contends that the
 
circuit court erred in upholding the 5/4/09 Memo as an effective
 settlement agreement and release. He argues that the 5/4/09 Memo
 was merely a proposal for a release that required the execution
 of a separate R&IA in the future. Jou also argues that HEMIC
 abandoned a material condition of the release, apparently by not
 pursuing execution of a separate R&IA. Jou's arguments lack
 merit.
 
At the first hearing on HEMIC's motions to enforce
 
settlement agreement, held on April 9, 2010, the parties mutually
 agreed that the requirement of a separate R&IA would be waived
 and that the 5/4/09 Memo would serve as the settlement agreement
 between the parties. On the record, Jou's counsel noted that
 HEMIC had "pretty much" agreed to "what I would ask the court to
 do which would be to strike the further obligation to fill out a
 new release and indemnity agreement." The circuit court then
 addressed HEMIC's counsel and noted that "an offer has been made
 to waive by mutual agreement this requirement of a separate
 release and indemnity agreement and simply use [the 5/4/09 Memo]
 as the settlement agreement between the parties." HEMIC's
 counsel agreed. The parties thus agreed to modify the settlement
 agreement set forth in the 5/4/09 Memo. See Honolulu Fed. Sav.
 
and Loan Ass'n v. Murphy, 7 Haw. App. 196, 204-05, 753 P.2d 807,
 813 (1988). Under the modified agreement, a separate R&IA was
 not required and the 5/4/09 Memo sets forth the terms of the
 settlement agreement.
 
Moreover, although Jou raises a variety of arguments
 
that the settlement agreement was fraudulently induced because
 HEMIC failed to disclose its recordation of the Fees/Cost
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Judgments, his opening brief makes clear that he did not elect to 
seek rescission of the settlement agreement. Instead, he elected to pursue an independent action for damages. See Exotics Hawaii-
Kona, Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 116 Hawai' i 277, 
289, 172 P.3d 1021, 1033 (2007) (holding that "rather than limit a party's remedy to rescission, we believe a defrauded party should be afforded the choice of remedies, i.e., rescission or an independent action for damages."). Thus, there is no basis to rescind or invalidate the settlement agreement on the basis of Jou's claims of fraud. 
The June 15 Order in Civil No. 03-1-1445, enforcing the
 
settlement agreement set forth in the 5/4/09 Memo, is therefore
 affirmed.
 
III. Dismissal of Claims in Civil No. 09-1-1529
 
Jou contends that the circuit court improperly enforced
 
the 5/4/09 Memo as a global release of his claims against HEMIC
 
and thus erred by dismissing Jou's claims in Civil No. 09-1-1529. 
Jou also contends that the claims asserted in Civil No. 09-1-1529
 had not yet accrued when the 5/4/09 Memo was executed and
 therefore these claims could not have been released by the
 settlement agreement.
 
As noted above, the parties mutually agreed to waive
 
any requirement for a separate R&IA, and therefore the 5/4/09
 Memo sets forth the entirety of the settlement agreement and
 release. Under these terms, Jou released "all claims accrued to
 date[.]" The 5/4/09 Memo also provided that Jou agreed not to
 "initiate administrative, judicial, or other proceedings for 10
 [years] . . . arising out of [services] provided by Jou or
 related providers (incl. Employers)."
 
The circuit court acknowledged that there may be a
 
question of whether Jou's fraud claims accrued after the 5/4/09
 Memo was executed, but dismissed Civil No. 09-1-1529 on grounds
 including that the court "simply does not see that a fraud claim
 exists," that dismissal of the other claims was warranted as part
 of the parties' efforts to buy their peace under the settlement
 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
agreement, and that as to the negligence claim HEMIC had no duty
 
to disclose the existence of the recorded judgments. In essence,
 therefore, the circuit court's dismissal of Civil No. 09-1-1529
 was based in part on the settlement agreement's release of claims
 and in part on a substantive determination as to the merits of
 the claims asserted in Civil No. 09-1-1529.
 
HEMIC's "Motion To Enforce Settlement By Dismissing 
Action" had exhibits attached thereto which the circuit court considered and hence the motion was not based solely on the allegations in Jou's first amended complaint. Therefore, HEMIC's motion must be treated as a motion for summary judgment. Wong v. 
Cayetano, 111 Hawai' i 462, 476, 143 P.3d 1, 15 (2006) ("a motion 
seeking dismissal of a complaint is transformed into a Hawai' i 
Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 56 motion for summary judgment when the circuit court considers matters outside the pleadings"); HRCP rule 12(c) ("[i]f, on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56[.]"). 
We thus review de novo, under summary judgment 
standards, whether the circuit court properly dismissed the claims in Civil No. 09-1-1529. See Stanford Carr Dev. Corp. v. 
Unity House Inc., 111 Hawai' i 286, 295, 141 P.3d 459, 468 (2006). 
[S]ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most
favorable to the party opposing the motion.
 
Kahale v. City and County of Honolulu, 104 Hawai' i 341, 344, 90 
P.3d 233, 236 (2004) (citation omitted).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The burden is on the party moving for summary judgment
(moving party) to show the absence of any genuine issue as
to all material facts, which, under applicable principles of
substantive law, entitles the moving party to judgment as a
matter of law. This burden has two components.
 
First, the moving party has the burden of producing
support for its claim that: (1) no genuine issue of material
fact exists with respect to the essential elements of the
claim or defense which the motion seeks to establish or
 which the motion questions; and (2) based on the undisputed
facts, it is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of
law. Only when the moving party satisfies its initial
burden of production does the burden shift to the non-moving
party to respond to the motion for summary judgment and
demonstrate specific facts, as opposed to general
allegations, that present a genuine issue worthy of trial.
 
Second, the moving party bears the ultimate burden of
persuasion. This burden always remains with the moving party
and requires the moving party to convince the court that no
genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving
part is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.
 
Stanford Carr Dev. Corp., 111 Hawai' i at 295-96, 141 P.3d at 468­
69 (citation omitted).
 
We further note that the enforceability of a settlement
 
agreement is a conclusion of law reviewable 
de novo. Sylvester
 
v. Animal Emergency Clinic of Oahu, 72 Haw. 560, 565, 825 P.2d 
1053, 1056 (1992). "If the language of a contract is unambiguous, . . . the interpretation of the contract presents a question of law to be decided by the court. In addition, the determination of whether a contract contains ambiguous terms is a threshold question of law for the court to decide." Wittig v. 
Allianz, A.G., 112 Hawai' i 195, 201, 145 P.3d 738, 744 (App. 
2006) (citations omitted). 
Given the applicable standards, we conclude that
 
summary judgment on Jou's claims in Civil No. 09-1-1529 was not
 warranted on this record. It appears that all of these claims
 arise from Jou's contention that HEMIC acted improperly in
 recording the Fees/Cost Judgments and/or in failing to disclose
 the recording of the judgments during settlement negotiations. 
To the extent that the claims were dismissed based on the
 settlement agreement's release, the Judgment is vacated because
 HEMIC failed to establish when the claims asserted in Civil No.
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
09-1-1529 had accrued. In particular, HEMIC as movant failed to
 
adduce any evidence or establish in the record that there was no
 genuine issue of material fact that Jou's claims in Civil No. 09­1-1529 had accrued by the time the 5/4/09 Memo was executed.
5
 
HEMIC also did not establish that Jou's claims in Civil
 
No. 09-1-1529 were precluded by Jou's agreement in the 5/4/09
 Memo not to "initiate administrative, judicial, or other
 proceedings for 10 [years] . . . arising out of [services]
 provided by Jou or related providers (incl. Employers)." There
 is nothing in the record to suggest that the dismissed claims
 arise out of "[services] provided by Jou or related providers."
 
Finally, to the extent that the dismissal of claims in
 
Civil No. 09-1-1529 was based on the circuit court's substantive
 determination of the merits, we must also vacate. As noted
 above, Jou asserted claims in Civil No. 09-1-1529 for tortious
 judgment lien; settlement fraud; settlement fraud (non disclosure
 making partial disclosure false); intentional infliction of
 emotional distress; and negligence. HEMIC's motion to dismiss
 the action was based on enforcing the settlement agreement. To
 the extent that HEMIC's "Motion To Enforce Settlement By
 Dismissing Action" argued about fraud, it was for the purpose of
 asserting that Jou's claims about settlement fraud were
 "irrelevant" and could not excuse compliance with the terms and
 conditions of the settlement. HEMIC's motion did not seek
 dismissal on the merits or demerits of the fraud claims. 
Likewise, HEMIC's motion did not seek dismissal or summary
 judgment on the substantive merits of the other claims asserted
 by Jou. Although the circuit court ultimately ruled, in part, on
 
5 In opposing HEMIC's motion, Jou submitted his response to HEMIC's
request for admissions and interrogatories in which he attests that "[o]n
May 18, 2009, I was attempting to obtain refinancing on real estate when a
loan officer discovered HEMIC's recordation of the judgment on September 22,
2008, Doc. Number 2008-147910. I was not aware that HEMIC had recorded the
 judgment or anything else." Jou's response does not explicitly state when he
learned about the recording of the Fees/Cost Judgments, but viewed in the
light most favorable to him as the non-moving party, his response suggests
that he did not learn about the recording of the judgments until after the
5/4/09 Memo had been signed.

the substantive merits of some of the claims, the substantive
 
merits were not properly raised or addressed by the parties.
IV. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, in Civil No. 03-1-1445, we
 
affirm the "Order Granting Defendant HEMIC's Motion to Enforce
 
Settlement" entered by the circuit court on June 15, 2010.
 
In Civil No. 09-1-1529, we vacate the Judgment entered
 
by the circuit court on July 8, 2010 and the "Order Granting
 Defendant HEMIC's Motion to Enforce Settlement by Dismissing
 Action" entered on June 16, 2010. We remand in Civil No. 09-1­1529 (appellate case no. 30607) for further proceedings.
