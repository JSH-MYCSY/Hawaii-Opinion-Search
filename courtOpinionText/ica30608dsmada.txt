NO. 30608
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellant, v.
PHOKHAM VONGVIENGKHAM, Defendant-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

 
(CASE NO. 1P109-0009742)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.) 
Upon review of the record, it appears that we lack 
jurisdiction over Plaintiff-Appellant State of Hawai 'i’s 
(Appellant) appeal in this matter, because Appellant’s appeal 
from the following two orders is not timely under Rule 4(b)(1) of the Hawai
'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP): the February 16, 
2010 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss" (the February 16, 2010 dismissal order) and the May 13, 2010 "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Granting Defendant's Motion to Dismiss" (May 13, 2010 dismissal order). 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision." State v. Poohina, 97 Hawai
'i 505, 509, 40 
P.3d 907, 911 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
omitted). Although the February 16, 2010 dismissal order and the 
May 13, 2010 dismissal order appear to be appealable orders
 pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 (HRS) § 641-13 (Supp. 2009), HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) requires that
 Appellant’s "notice of appeal shall be filed in the circuit . . .
 court within 30 days after the entry of the . . . order appealed
 from." HRAP Rule 4(b)(1). "A judgment or order is entered
 within the meaning of this subsection when it is filed with the
 clerk of the court." HRAP Rule 4(b)(3). When a trial court
 enters multiple appealable judgments or orders,
 
[t]he general rule is that where a judgment is amended in a
material and substantial respect, the time within which an
appeal from such determination may be taken begins to run
from the date of the amendment, although where the amendment
relates only to the correction of a clerical error, it does
not affect the time allowed for appeal.
 
Poe v. Hawai 'i Labor Relations Board, 98 Hawai 'i 416, 418, 49 P.3d 
382, 384 (2002) (citation, internal quotation marks, and ellipsis
 
points omitted); State v. Mainaaupo, 117 Hawai 'i 235, 246 n.6, 
178 P.3d 1, 12 n.6 (2008).
 
If the amendment of a final judgment or decree for the
purpose of correcting a clerical error either materially
alters rights or obligations determined by the prior
judgment or decree or creates a right of appeal where one
did not exist before, the time for appeal should be measured
from the entry of the amended judgment. If, however, the
amendment has neither of these results, but instead makes
changes in the prior judgment which have no adverse effect
upon those rights or obligations or the parties' right to
appeal, the entry of the amended judgment will not postpone
the time within which an appeal must be taken from the
original decree.
 
Poe v. Hawai 'i Labor Relations Board, 98 Hawai 'i at 418, 49 P.3d 
at 384 (citations, internal quotation marks, and brackets 
omitted; emphases added). The February 16, 2010 dismissal order was immediately appealable pursuant to subsections (1) and (2) of HRS § 641-13. The May 13, 2010 dismissal order does not appear 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
to have amended the February 16, 2010 dismissal order in a 
material and substantial respect. The May 13, 2010 dismissal order merely repeats the same substantive ruling as the February 16, 2010 dismissal order. Therefore, it appears that the February 16, 2010 dismissal order triggered the thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) for filing a notice of appeal, and the subsequent May 13, 2010 dismissal order did not postpone the time within which Appellant needed to appeal from the February 16, 2010 dismissal order. 
Appellant did not file the June 10, 2010 notice of 
appeal within thirty days after entry of the February 16, 2010 dismissal order, as HRAP Rule 4(b)(1) required, and, thus, Appellant’s appeal is untimely. "As a general rule, compliance with the requirement of timely filing of a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, and we must dismiss an appeal on our motion if we lack jurisdiction." State v. Knight, 80 Hawai
'i 318, 323, 909 
P.2d 1133, 1137 (1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. 30608 is dismissed
 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
