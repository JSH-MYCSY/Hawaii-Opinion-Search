HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1P109-13507)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Dong Mei Li (Li) appeals from the
 
Judgment entered on May 28, 2010, in the District Court of the
 
First Circuit (District Court).1 Li was charged by complaint
 
with harassment, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
§ 711-1106(1)(b) and/or (1)(f) (Supp. 2010).

 HRS § 711-1106(1)(b) and (1)(f) provide as follows:
 
(1) A person commits the offense of harassment if, with
intent to harass, annoy, or alarm any other person, that person:
 
. . . .
 
(b)	 Insults, taunts, or challenges another person in a
manner likely to provoke an immediate violent response
or that would cause the other person to reasonably
believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury
to the recipient or another or damage to the property
of the recipient or another; [or] 
(continued...)

trial, the District Court found Li guilty as charged of both the
 
HRS § 711-1106(1)(b) and (1)(f) means of committing harassment. 
The District Court sentenced Li to six months of probation,
 subject to the condition that she obtain an anger management
 and/or a mental health assessment, and to a $200 fine and a $30
 assessment.
 
On appeal, Li argues that (1) there was insufficient
 
evidence to support her conviction; and (2) the District Court
 committed plain error in failing to sua sponte dismiss the charge
 against Li as a de minimis infraction pursuant to HRS § 702-236
 (1993).
3 We affirm.
 
I.
 
We resolve Li's arguments on appeal as follows:
 1.	 The evidence showed, among other things, that Li
 
approached the complaining witness (CW); that Li repeatedly
 
2(...continued)
. . . . 
 
(f) 	Makes a communication using offensively coarse
language that would cause the recipient to reasonably
believe that the actor intends to cause bodily injury
to the recipient or another or damage to the property
of the recipient or another.
 
3 HRS § 702-236 provides:
 
(1) The court may dismiss a prosecution if, having regard
to the nature of the conduct alleged and the nature of the
attendant circumstances, it finds that the defendant's conduct:
 
(a)	 Was within a customary license or tolerance, which was
not expressly refused by the person whose interest was
infringed and which is not inconsistent with the
purpose of the law defining the offense; or 
(b)	 Did not actually cause or threaten the harm or evil
sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense
or did so only to an extent too trivial to warrant the
condemnation of conviction; or 
(c)	 Presents such other extenuations that it cannot
 reasonably be regarded as envisaged by the legislature
in forbidding the offense. 
(2) The court shall not dismiss a prosecution under
subsection (1)(c) of this section without filing a written
statement of its reasons.

screamed obscenities at the CW while he was in a vulnerable
 
position; and that Li's actions caused the CW to become scared. 
We conclude that when viewed in the light most favorable to the
 prosecution, there was substantial evidence to support Li's
 conviction. See State v. Tamura, 63 Haw. 636, 637, 633 P.2d
 
1115, 1117 (1981). 
2. Li did not move in the District Court to dismiss 
the charge as a de minimis infraction under HRS § 702-236. The decision to dismiss a charge pursuant to HRS § 702-236 rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Ornellas, 79 
Hawai'i 418, 423, 903 P.2d 723, 728 (App. 1995). As a general 
rule, an argument not raised in the trial court will be deemed to have been waived on appeal. State v. Moses, 102 Hawai' i 449, 
456, 77 P.3d 940, 947 (2003). We decline to consider Li's argument that her harassment charge should have been dismissed as a de minimus infraction, which she raises for the first time on appeal. 
II. 
For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the May 28, 2010,
 
Judgment of the District Court.
