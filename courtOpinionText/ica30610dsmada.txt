NO. 30610
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
H.
 ISABELLE MCGARRY TRUST OF MARCH 19, 1971,
Judgment-Creditor/Third-Party Defendant/Appellee, 
v.
 
ROBERT HOFELICH and ANN MARIE HOFELICH,
Judgment-Debtors/Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(S.P. NO. 97-0004K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) Howard Hofelich's appeal from the
 
Honorable Elizabeth A. Stance's July 2, 2010 amended judgment and
 
(2) the record on appeal, it appears that we do not have
 jurisdiction over appellate court case number 30610 because
 Howard Hofelich lacks standing to assert an appeal in this
 matter.
 
We initially note that Judgment-Creditor/Third-Party
 
Defendant/Appellee H. Isabelle McGarry Trust of March 19, 1971
 (Appellee McGarry Trust), initiated S.P. No. 97-004K by filing an
 exemplified California judgment pursuant to HRS § 636C-3 (1993),
 under which the California judgment "has the same effect and is
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for 
reopening, vacating, or staying as a judgment of a court of this State, including establishing a lien, and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner." HRS § 636C-3. Appellee McGarry Trust subsequently initiated S.P. 00-1-0014K and S.P. 00-1-0016K, attaching exemplified California orders awarding attorneys’ fees and costs in favor of the McGarry Trust and against Appellees Robert Hofelich and Ann Marie Hofelich. 
Although the instant case has primarily involved post-
judgment proceedings for the purpose of Appellee McGarry Trust
 executing the exemplified California judgment against the assets
 of Judgment-Debtors/Appellees Robert Hofelich and Ann Marie
 Hofelich, on May 11, 1999, the circuit court entered an order
 authorizing Intervenor-Appellee South Pacific Scuba Tours, Inc.
 (South Pacific Scuba Tours), to intervene as a party in this
 case. Furthermore, on April 3, 2000, the circuit court entered
 an order authorizing Intervenors/Third-Party Plaintiffs/Appellees
 Jeff Bowden and Bonnie Bowden (the Bowden Appellees) to intervene
 as parties in this case, and the Bowden Appellees filed a
 complaint in intervention against Appellee McGarry Trust. 
On June 23, 2000, the circuit court consolidated S.P.
 
No. 97-004K together with S.P. No. 00-1-0014K and S.P. No. 00-1­0016K. Thereafter, in an apparent attempt to resolve all claims
 in S.P. No. 97-004K, including the Bowden Appellees' complaint in
 intervention, the circuit court reduced its dispositive orders to
 the July 2, 2010 amended judgment. 
Throughout the duration of the consolidated cases,
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Howard Hofelich has never obtained the circuit court's permission 
to intervene in S.P. No. 97-004K, S.P. No. 00-1-0014K and S.P. No. 00-1-0016K pursuant to Rule 24 of the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil 
Procedure (HRCP). The Supreme Court of Hawai 'i has stated that 
[g]enerally, the requirements of standing to appeal are: (1)
the person must first have been a party to the action; (2)
the person seeking modification of the order or judgment
must have had standing to oppose it in the trial court; and
(3) such person must be aggrieved by the ruling, i.e., the
person must be one who is affected or prejudiced by the
appealable order.
 
Abaya v. Mantell, 112 Hawai 'i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in 
original). "In other words, non-parties, who did not or could not intervene, are ordinarily denied standing to appeal." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). Accordingly, as a non-party in the underlying consolidated case, Howard Hofelich lacks standing to assert his appeal in appellate court case number 30610. 
Although Howard Hofelich claims to be the trustee of

 
Appellee McGarry Trust, the record on appeal shows that, as long
 as attorneys represented Appellee McGarry Trust in this case,
 Mark McShane was the trustee of record for Appellee McGarry
 Trust. The attorneys for Appellee McGarry Trust eventually
 formally withdrew from representing Appellee McGarry Trust in
 this case, and the record on appeal does not contain credible
 evidence that Howard Hofelich ever replaced Mark McShane as the
 trustee of Appellee McGarry Trust.
 
Therefore, without reaching the issue whether the
 
July 2, 2010 amended judgment is an appealable judgment that
 resolved all claims against all parties in the consolidated cases

of S.P. No. 97-004K, S.P. No. 00-1-0014K and S.P. No. 00-1­

0016K, we hold that, because Howard Hofelich is not a party in
this case, Howard Hofelich is not entitled to assert an appeal on

 
behalf of Appellee McGarry Trust. Based on Howard Hofelich's
 
lack of standing to assert an appeal in appellate court case
 number 30610, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. 
Accordingly,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court case number

 
30610 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
