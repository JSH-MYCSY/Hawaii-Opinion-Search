ROBERT HOFELICH and ANN MARIE HOFELICH,
Judgment-Debtors/Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(S.P. NO. 97-0004K)
 
ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF DISMISSAL ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the November 23, 2010 order 
dismissing appellate court case number 30610 (dismissal order) 
for lack of appellate jurisdiction, (2) Howard Hofelich's (Hofelich) December 13, 2010 motion for reconsideration of the dismissal order pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawai
'i Rules of 
Appellate Procedure (HRAP), and (3) the record, it appears that Hofelich's December 13, 2010 motion for reconsideration of the dismissal order is untimely and lacks merit. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
"A motion for reconsideration may be filed by a party
 
only within 10 days after the filing of the opinion,
 
dispositional order, or ruling unless by special leave additional
 time is granted during such period by a judge or justice of the
 appellate court involved." HRAP Rule 40(a). Hofelich did not
 file his December 13, 2010 HRAP Rule 40 motion for
 reconsideration (motion for reconsideration) within ten days
 after the filing of the dismissal order, as HRAP Rule 40(a)
 requires. Therefore, Hofelich's motion for reconsideration is
 untimely.
 
Furthermore, when we filed the dismissal order, we did
 
not overlook or misapprehend any points of law or fact. 
Therefore, Hofelich's motion for reconsideration lacks merit. 
Accordingly,
 
Hofelich's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal
 
order is denied.
