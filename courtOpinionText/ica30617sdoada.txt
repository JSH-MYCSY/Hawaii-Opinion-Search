RONALD GOMES, Petitioner-Appellant,
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee.
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 09-1-0008(2) (CR. NO. 91-0374(2)))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Ronald Gomes (Gomes) appeals from
 
the "Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment Denying
 
Rule 40 Petition for Post-Conviction Relief" (Order Denying
 Petition), which was filed on June 21, 2010, in the Circuit Court
 of the Second Circuit (Circuit Court).
1 We affirm.
 
I.
 
Gomes was convicted of first degree sexual assault and 
manslaughter. He was sentenced in 1996 to concurrent extended terms of life imprisonment, with the possibility of parole, for the first degree sexual assault conviction and twenty years of imprisonment for the manslaughter conviction. Gomes filed a direct appeal, and in 1998, the Hawai' i Supreme Court, via 
summary disposition order, affirmed Gomes's conviction and

2sentence.  Thereafter, Gomes initiated numerous post-conviction
proceedings, seeking a reduction in his sentence and challenging
the validity of his extended term sentences.  See State v. Gomes,
107 Hawai'i 308, 310-12, 113 P.3d 184, 186-88 (2005) (describing
a number of Gomes's post-conviction proceedings).
On May 8, 2009, Gomes filed the "Petition to Vacate,
Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner [from]
Custody" (Petition) at issue in this appeal.  On June 21, 2010,
the Circuit Court issued its Order Denying Petition, which denied
the Petition without a hearing, pursuant to Hawai #i Rules of
Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 40(f) (2006). 
II.
On appeal, Gomes argues that based on State v.
Maugaotega, 115 Hawai #i 432, 168 P.3d 562 (2007) (hereinafter,
"Maugaotega II"), the version of the statute under which his
extended term sentences were imposed, Hawaii Revised Statutes
(HRS) § 706-662 (1993), was void ab initio  and thus the extended
term sentences imposed on him were a nullity.  Gomes requests
that we vacate the Circuit Court's Order Denying Petition and
order that he be resentenced to "ordinary term" sentences.
Upon review of the record and the briefs submitted by
the parties, we hold as follows:
Maugaotega II does not apply retroactively to Gomes's
collateral attack of his extended term sentences.  See Gomes, 107
Hawai#i at 312-14, 113 P.3d at 188-90; Loher v. State, 118 Hawai# i
522, 534-38, 193 P.3d 438, 450-54 (App. 2008); United States v.
Cruz, 423 F.3d 1119, 1120-21 (9th Cir. 2005).  The version of HRS
§ 706-662 under which Gomes's extended term sentences were
imposed was not void ab initio.  See State v. Jess, 117 Hawai #i
381, 386-89, 406-15, 184 P.3d 133, 138-41, 158-67 (2008); State
v. Cutsinger, 118 Hawai# i 68, 79-82, 185 P.3d 816, 827-830 (App.
2008), overruled in part on other grounds by Jess, 117 Hawai #i at
398 n.17, 184 P.3d at 150 n.17; Loher, 118 Hawai# i at 534-38, 193
P.3d at 450-54.  Gomes's convictions and extended term sentences
became final before the United States Supreme Court announced its NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
new constitutional rule of criminal procedure in Apprendi v. New 
Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and thus Gomes's extended term sentences were clearly constitutional and legal when imposed. Gomes, 107 Hawai' i at 314, 113 P.3d at 190. 
In Jess, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held that the trial 
court had the authority to resentence Jess to extended terms of imprisonment pursuant to the former version of the extended term sentencing statute, HRS § 706-662 (Supp. 1996), which was in effect in 2000 when Jess committed the charged offenses, by the trial court's invoking its inherent judicial power to empanel a jury to make the "necessity" finding. Jess, 117 Hawai' i at 386­
89, 410-13, 184 P.3d at 138-41, 162-65; see also State v. Mark, 123 Hawai' i 205, 249-50, 231 P.3d 478, 522-23 (2010). The 
supreme court could not have reached this conclusion in Jess if the former version of HRS § 706-662 was void ab initio.
2 
Gomes's reliance on Maugaotega II is misplaced. The 
statement in Maugaotega II that the former version of HRS § 706­662 was "unconstitutional on its face" was premised on the supreme court's then-held belief that the Hawai' i Legislature 
only wanted to vest in the sentencing court, and not in a jury, the power to find the aggravating facts required to impose an extended term sentence. See Maugaotega II, 115 Hawai' i at 446­
50, 168 P.2d at 576-80. Because the former version of HRS § 706­662 "in all of its manifestations" (i.e., each subsection of HRS

 In Maugaotega II, the Hawai' i Supreme Court considered the Supp. 2003
version of HRS § 706-662. In 2006, the Hawai' i Legislature temporarily
amended the Supp. 2003 version of HRS §§ 706-661 and 706-662 by enacting Act
230 (hereinafter, "Act 230"). 2006 Haw. Sess. L. Act 230, §§ 23-24 at1011-13. The amendments to HRS §§ 706-661 and 706-662 made by Act 230 wentinto effect on June 22, 2006, and expired on June 30, 2007, at which time theSupp. 2003 version of HRS §§ 706-661 and 706-662 was reenacted. 2006 Haw. Sess. L. Act 230, § 54 at 1025. Subsequently, the Hawai' i Legislature enacted
Act 1 of the 2007 Second Special Session (hereinafter, "Act 1"), 2007 Haw.Sess. L., Second Special Session, Act 1, at 1-4, which amended the reenactedSupp. 2003 version of HRS §§ 706-661 and 706-662 and also amended HRS §706-664. Act 1 took effect on October 31, 2007. Unless otherwise indicated,our reference in this Summary Disposition Order to the "former version of HRS§ 706-662" refers collectively to the pre-2006 versions of HRS § 706-662 atissue in Maugaotega II, Jess, Mark, and Gomes's case, which versions are notmaterially different for purposes of the supreme court's and our analysis.

finding in order to impose an extended term,  the court's belief
that the Legislature only wanted the sentencing court to make the 
requisite extended term findings necessarily meant that each subsection of HRS § 706-662 was unconstitutional. 
See id.
 at 
446-47, 168 P.3d at 576-77; Jess, 117 Hawai' i at 410, 184 P.3d at 
162. 
However, after Maugaotega II was decided, the
 
Legislature clearly expressed its intent and desire that juries
 be empowered to make the findings necessary to impose extended
 term sentences by enacting Act 1 of the 2007 Second Special
 Session ("Act 1"), 2007 Haw. Sess. L., Second Special Session,
 Act 1, at 1-4. In Jess, the supreme court observed that the
 enactment of Act 1 
provides this court with a fresh, conclusive expression of
legislative support for the use of juries as the trier of
fact with respect to extended term sentencing fact-finding
and allows us to conclude with confidence that empaneling a
jury would closely effectuate policy judgments clearly
articulated by the legislature, and that the legislature
would prefer such a reformed version of the statute to
invalidation of the statute[.] 
Jess, 117 Hawai' i at 412-13, 184 P.3d at 164-65 (internal 
quotation marks, citations, brackets, ellipsis, and footnote 
omitted). 
The court explained that its ruling in Maugaotega II, 
that the former version of HRS § 706-662 was unconstitutional in all of its manifestations, was based on its then-existing belief regarding the Legislature's intent. Jess, 117 Hawai' i at 413 
n.27, 184 P.3d at 165 n.27. The court concluded that because the subsequent enactment of Act 1 had changed the court's understanding of the Legislature's intent, and because Act 1 provided conclusive evidence that the Legislature supported the empaneling of juries to make the requisite extended term 
3
 In order to impose an extended term, each subsection of the former
version of HRS § 706-662 required a "necessity" finding, that is, a finding
that the imprisonment of the defendant for an extended term was "necessary for
[the] protection of the public." See HRS § 706-662 (Supp. 2003).

findings, the application of the former version of HRS § 706-662, 
which the court had found unconstitutional in Maugaotega II, in resentencing Jess did not violate precedent or the principles of stare decisis. Id. In other words, the court in Jess concluded 
that because the Legislature, by enacting Act 1, clearly endorsed the empanelment of juries to make the requisite extended term findings, the former version of HRS § 706-662 could be judicially reformed and constitutionally applied by procedurally substituting a jury for the sentencing court as the fact-finder. See id.; Mark, 123 Hawai' i at 249-50, 231 P.3d at 522-23. The 
supreme court's holding in Jess, that the former version of HRS § 706-662 may be judicially modified and constitutionally applied, definitively establishes that the former version of HRS § 706-662, under which Gomes was sentenced, is not void ab initio. 
III.
 
For the foregoing reasons, we reject Gomes's challenge
 
to the validity of his extended term sentences. We affirm the
 Order Denying Petition filed by the Circuit Court on June 21,
 2010.
