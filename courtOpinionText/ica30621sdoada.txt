The July 1, 2008 Order is an interlocutory order that is properly
reviewed on appeal from the divorce decree. See, State v. Adam, 97 Hawai' i 
475, 482, 40 P.3d 877, 884 (2002) (citations omitted). Notwithstanding thatthe referenced memoranda appear to be signed by the judge and are part of therecord of these proceedings pursuant to Rule 4 of the Hawaii Court RecordRules, they do not appear to be orders of the court. Instead, these memorandaappear to be in the nature of minutes or correspondence to counsel to informthe parties of the court's decision on matters taken under advisement by thecourt and to direct counsel in the preparation of the form of the order ordecree to be submitted to the court for its review and possible entry. Thus,we consider these memoranda and any order amending such memoranda in thiscontext. NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Third Circuit ("Family Court").2 In appellate case number 30621,
 
Norman appeals from the Family Court's June 16, 2010 Order
 
Denying Defendant's Motion for Approval of Surety Bond and Stay
 Pending Appeal Filed January 13, 2010, and Deferring Plaintiff's
 Motion and Declaration for Order to Show Cause for Relief after
 Order or Decree Filed February 11, 2010 ("June 16, 2010 Order"). 
On January 13, 2011, the two cases were consolidated for
 disposition under appellate case number 29897.
 
On appeal, Norman alleges that the Family Court erred 
by: (1) not sanctioning Plaintiff-Appellee Elizabeth Ann AmbroseÂ­Berg's ("Elizabeth") counsel under Hawai' i Family Court Rules 
("HFCR") Rule 89 and HFCR Rule 11 for signing a motion for partial summary judgment ("November 30, 2007 Motion") that incorporated inadmissible evidence; (2) finding that Norman had entered into a stipulation that he would be solely responsible for the repayment of a home equity line of credit ("Countrywide HELC") secured by one of the parties' properties; (3) not resolving all of the money obtained by Norman from his mother ("Carmen") as a loan or gift subject to division between the parties; (4) allowing Elizabeth's psychiatrist ("Dr. Lee") to testify and introduce records into evidence when the records were not disclosed to Norman in a timely manner; (5) entering a provision in the June 16, 2010 Order that was inconsistent with the oral ruling made by the Family Court on May 21, 2010; (6) entering two Findings of Fact ("FOFs") and two Conclusions of Law ("COLs") that "do not reflect [Norman's] compliance with the oral ruling made by [the Family Court] on May 21, 2010"; and (7) entering the Third Interim Judgement Regarding Attorney's Fees and Costs ("Third Interim Judgment"). 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Norman's points of error as follows. 
We begin by addressing Norman's points of error in
 
appellate case number 29897:
 
2/
 The Honorable Lloyd Van de Car presided.
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
(1) "We review the grant or denial of . . . sanctions
 
for abusive litigation practices under the abuse of discretion
 
standard." Lester v. Rapp, 85 Hawai' i 238, 241, 942 P.2d 502, 
505 (1997). 
Elizabeth's November 30, 2007 Motion sought to resolve
 
the legal question of whether, in dividing the couple's property,
 Norman's Category 1 property was to be subtracted first with the
 remainder to be divided (Norman's position), or whether Norman's
 Category 2 property was to be subtracted first with the remainder
 to be divided (Elizabeth's position).
3 In her motion, Elizabeth
 
utilized marital property values and calculations offered by
 Norman in an earlier confidential settlement communication to
 illustrate the two positions. 
In denying Norman's subsequent motion for attorneys'
 
fees under HFCR Rule 11 and Rule 89, the Family Court issued the
 following relevant FOFs and COLs on July 24, 2009:
 
Findings of Fact
 
. . . .
 
24.	 At the hearing on the motion, the Court informed the
parties that it agreed with Defendant that Helbush
 
supported Defendant's position regarding Category 1
credits and would base its ruling denying the motion
on those substantive grounds if Plaintiff desired, but
otherwise would deny the motion on the procedural
grounds involving admissible evidence. Plaintiff did
 not request a substantive ruling and the motion was
denied on the procedural grounds;
 
. . . .
 
26.	 Based on Helbush, Plaintiff's motion for partial
summary judgment would have been denied even if
supported by admissible evidence, so Plaintiff's use
of the settlement materials in the motion did not
 cause Defendant to incur fees and costs he would not
 have otherwise incurred;
 
. . . . 
Conclusions of Law
 
. . . .
 
9.	 When use of inadmissible evidence in support of a
motion for summary judgment does not cause the party
opposing the motion to needlessly incur fees and
costs, the use of that evidence is not sanctionable.
 
3/
 Elizabeth framed her motion as a request "to resolve a legal
question based upon facts undisputed for purposes of this Motion."

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
As part of his appeal of this issue, Norman challenges FOF 26 and
 
COL 9. 
FOF 26 is not clearly erroneous in that it merely
 
reflects the Family Court's explanation that if it had reached
 the merits of Elizabeth's motion for partial summary judgment (as
 it said it could have in FOF 24, which is unchallenged), it would
 have denied the motion under Helbush. Consequently, FOF 26
 correctly observes that "Plaintiff's use of the settlement
 materials in the motion did not cause Defendant to incur fees and
 costs he would not have otherwise incurred." 
COL 9, however, goes too far. If the Family Court 
concluded that counsel's use of the settlement materials violated HFCR Rule 11, then the court must impose sanctions (including, possibly, attorneys' fees). See Haw. Fam. Ct. R. 11 ("[T]he 
court . . . shall impose . . . an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay . . . the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing . . . , including a reasonable attorney's fee."); cf. Lepere v. United Pub. Workers, Local 646, AFL-CIO, 77 Hawai'i 471, 474, 887 P.2d 1029, 1032 (1995) ("Having determined 
that Lepere violated HRCP Rule 11, the circuit court has no choice but to sanction Lepere . . . ."). The record does not indicate that the Family Court determined whether Elizabeth's incorporation of data from the confidential settlement communication constituted an HFCR Rule 11 violation. Consequently, we vacate COL 9 and remand for adoption of FOF and COL related to whether an HFCR Rule 11 violation occurred and whether, in light of that, any sanctions are appropriate. 
(2) The Family Court erred in finding that Norman had
 
stipulated to be solely responsible for the repayment of the
 entire Countrywide HELC (FOF 11) and incorporating that finding
 in its subsequent conclusion (COL 6). 
Neither the Family Court in the Decree nor the parties
 
in their briefs refer us to anywhere in the record where the
 alleged stipulation occurred. While there exists sufficient
 evidence to support a finding that Norman stipulated to being
 solely responsible for the repayment of the portion of the
 Countrywide HELC that he drew down in excess of the monthly
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
allowances explicitly permitted by the Family Court, the Family
 
Court's determination that Norman had agreed to be responsible
 for the entirety of the Countrywide HELC is unsupported by the
 record. Since the Family Court appears to base its calculation
 of the parties' Category 5 assets and debts, in part, on its
 finding that "Defendant has agreed to pay [the Countrywide HELC]
 in its entirety," we vacate FOFs 11, 13, and 14, and COL 6 of the
 July 24, 2009 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and
 section 4 of the Decree, which relates to the division of
 property, and remand for further determination of the proper
 treatment of the liability associated with the Countrywide HELC.
 
(3) The Family Court did not fail to allocate the
 
liability associated with the various sums of money received by
 Norman from Carmen. Norman bases his contention on the fact that
 there was testimony that Carmen had loaned him $60,000, but that
 the Family Court "noted that the loan was only $6,000." Although
 the Family Court was less than perfectly clear in its treatment
 of the various loans from Carmen, we find substantial evidence to
 support the Family Court's FOF that recognized that $6,000 was
 owed to Carmen from the parties' marital estate.
4 The Family
 
Court's FOF 10, therefore, is not clearly erroneous. 
(4) A trial court's decision to exclude or to refuse to 
exclude evidence as a discovery sanction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See Stender v. Vincent, 92 Hawai' i 355, 362, 992 
P.3d 50, 57 (2000). "[T]he trial court has a broad spectrum of 
4/
 The record reflects four loans from Carmen: a $15,000 loan
incurred in 1982 ("Loan 1"); a $15,000 loan incurred in 2004 ("Loan 2"); a
$20,000 loan incurred for the repairs of the parties' Pu' u'eo house ("Loan 3");
and the aforementioned $60,000 loan made one week before trial to coverattorneys' fees ("Loan 4"). Presumably, the Family Court discounted Loans 1,3, and 4 because Loan 1 was incurred prior to the parties' marriage, Loan 3was incurred solely by Norman without the expectation that Elizabeth would bejointly liable for the repayment, and Loan 4 was not identified as a maritaldebt. 
Loan 2, on the other hand, was incurred in 2004 by the parties to
purchase real property in Hilo. Norman testified that he had made $500 â
 $1,000 monthly payments to Carmen to repay the money that he owed her. A
 summary of the amounts paid by Norman to Carmen was received into evidence as
Exhibit 26A at the January 2, 2009 trial. The total documented amount paid to
Carmen was $9,000. At trial, Norman admitted that Exhibit 26A correctly
reflected the amounts that he actually paid to Carmen for repayment of her
loan. The original Loan 2 was for $15,000 and Norman repaid $9,000, leaving a
balance of $6,000 owed to Carmen from the marital estate.

sanctions to impose [for discovery violations], although the
 
sanction chosen must be commensurate with the offense." Weinberg
 
v. Dickson-Weinberg, 123 Hawai' i 68, 75, 229 P.3d 1133, 1140 
(2010) (quoting Weinberg v. Dickson-Weinberg, 121 Hawai' i 401, 
437, 220 P.3d 264, 300 (App. 2009)). 
The Family Court's decision to not sanction Elizabeth
 
by refusing to admit Dr. Lee's records, but, instead, to offer
 Norman a continuance of the trial, appears "commensurate with the
 offense" under the circumstances. Consequently, we find no abuse
 of discretion.
 
Having addressed Norman's points of error in appellate
 
case number 29897, we proceed to consider his points of error in
 appellate case number 30621:
 
(5â7) Norman's remaining points of error all relate to
 
the portion of the June 16, 2010 Order that adjudicated part, but
 not all, of Elizabeth's February 11, 2010 post-judgment Motion
 and Declaration for Order to Show Cause for Relief After Order or
 Decree ("February 11, 2010 Motion").
5 With regard to that
 
portion, the June 16, 2010 Order directed Norman to rescind
 certain deeds of trust, ordered Norman to comply with an
 October 1, 2009 order within thirty days by using his best
 efforts to liquidate a particular piece of real property, and
 awarded attorneys' fees and costs (in an amount to be specified
 at a later date) to Elizabeth. The June 16, 2010 Order stated
 explicitly that the Family Court was not yet finished
 adjudicating all of Elizabeth's February 11, 2010 Motion:
 
Plaintiff's Motion and Declaration For Order to Show Cause
 
For Relief After Order or Decree filed February 11, 2010[,]
is deferred until moved upon. Sanctions, if any, shall be
measured not only by Defendant's conduct, but the
consequences to Plaintiff. Plaintiff and/or Defendant may
conduct discovery on the issue of sanctions.
 
This court lacks appellate jurisdiction to review the
 
portion of the June 16, 2010 Order that partially adjudicated
 
Elizabeth's February 11, 2010 Motion because that portion of the
 order does not qualify as an appealable final post-judgment
 
5/
 The other portion of the June 16, 2010 Order expressly denied in
its entirety Norman's January 13, 2010 post-judgment HFCR Rule 62 motion to
stay execution of the May 12, 2009 Decree.

order. In appeals from family court divorce matters, we have 
acknowledged that "[a] post-judgment order is an appealable final order under HRS Â§ 641-1(a) if the order finally determines the post-judgment proceeding." Hall v. Hall, 96 Hawai' i 105, 111 
n.4, 26 P.3d 594, 600 n.4 (App. 2001), vacated in part on other grounds, 95 Hawai' i 318, 22 P.3d 965 (2001). "A post-judgment 
order is an appealable final order under HRS Â§ 641-1(a) if the order ends the proceedings, leaving nothing further to be accomplished." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 157, 80 P.3d 
974, 978 (2003). On the other hand, however, "an order is not final if the rights of a party involved remain undetermined or if the matter is retained for further action." Cho v. State, 115 
Hawai'i 373, 383, 168 P.3d 17, 27 (2007) (quoting Bocalbos v. 
Kapiolani Med. Ctr. for Women & Children, 89 Hawai' i 436, 439, 
974 P.2d 1026, 1029 (1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
At the time that Norman filed his July 14, 2010 notice
 
of appeal in appellate case number 30621, the Family Court had
 neither announced nor entered the last of the series of orders
 that the court evidently intended to utilize to finally determine
 and end the post-judgment proceeding for Elizabeth's February 11,
 2010 Motion.
6 Therefore, to the extent that the June 16, 2010
 
Order partially but not fully adjudicated Elizabeth's
 February 11, 2010 Motion, the order was not a final and
 appealable post-judgment order under HRS Â§Â§ 641-1(a) and 571-54.
 
Accordingly, we lack appellate jurisdiction to review
 
the points of error that Norman has asserted in appellate case
 number 30621.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that FOFs 11, 13, and 14, and COLs
 
6 and 9 of the July 24, 2009 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
 Law; and section 4 of the May 12, 2009 Divorce Decree are
 vacated. The May 12, 2009 Divorce Decree is affirmed in all
 other respects as is the July 1, 2008 Order Denying Defendant's
 
6/
 The Family Court subsequently entered two documents related to
Elizabeth's February 11, 2010 Motion: (1) a July 27, 2010 Findings of Fact and
Conclusions of Law and (2) the Third Interim Judgment. However, neither of
these two documents finally determined or ended the post-judgment proceedings
for all of the pending issues in Elizabeth's February 11, 2010 Motion.
