On appeal, Sauceda contends that: (1) his trial
 
counsel was ineffective for failing to file a timely notice of
 
appeal from the entry of the Judgment; and (2) the Circuit Court
 
abused its discretion when it denied his motion to reduce
 
sentence.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Sauceda's points of error as follows:
 
(1) Sauceda argues that his former counsel was 
ineffective in failing to file a notice of appeal from the final 
judgment entered on May 4, 2010. Sauceda maintains that this 
failure impaired several potentially meritorious defenses by 
precluding him from raising them on appeal. He alternatively 
argues that if the record on appeal is insufficiently developed, 
we should affirm without prejudice so that Sauceda may raise his 
claims in a petition under Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure 
(HRPP) Rule 40. Upon review, we conclude that the record is 
insufficient to address Sauceda's ineffective assistance of 
counsel claims, and therefore affirm without prejudice to a 
subsequent HRPP Rule 40 petition. See, e.g., State v. Silva, 75 
Haw. 419, 438-39, 864 P.2d 583, 592-93 (1993); Briones v. State, 74 Haw. 442, 463, 848 P.2d 966, 977 (1993). 
(2) Sauceda argues that the Circuit Court abused its
 
discretion in denying his motion to reduce the sentence,
 
contending that the court did not take into account Sauceda's
 
version of events or make an express credibility determination. 
A sentencing judge enjoys broad discretion in imposing 
sentences. State v. Hussein, 122 Hawai' i 495, 503, 229 P.3d 313, 
321 (2010). However, the court must consider the factors set forth in HRS ยง 706-606 (1993). These same factors also apply to 
the court's decision on an HRPP Rule 35(b) motion to reduce a 
sentence. State v. Kahapea, 111 Hawai' i 267, 278, 280-82, 141 
2   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
P.3d 440, 451, 453-55 (2006). It is presumed that the court has 
considered all of the statutory factors "[a]bsent clear evidence 
to the contrary." Hussein, 122 Hawai' i at 503, 229 P.3d at 321 
(citation omitted). Although the sentencing court is not required to state its reasons for imposing a sentence, it is 
"urged and strongly recommended" to do so. Id. at 503, 229 P.3d 
at 321 (citation omitted). 
Sauceda's core contention is that there is no 
indication that the Circuit Court considered the conflicting testimony and found that Sauceda lacked credibility. However, 
Sauceda has not cited, and we have not found, any authority 
requiring the sentencing court to articulate the credibility 
determinations underlying its sentencing decision. See State v. 
Sinagoga, 81 Hawai' i 421, 428, 918 P.2d 228, 235 (App. 1996) 
(noting that sentencing judge is not required to expressly cite 
its findings for each factor), overruled on other grounds by 
State v. Veikoso, 102 Hawai' i 219, 74 P.3d 575 (2003). 
Moreover, the Circuit Court complied with the 
recommendation of Hussein by thoroughly explaining its reasons 
for the sentence. 122 Hawai' i at 503-504, 229 P.3d at 321-22. 
It discussed each factor in HRS ยง 706-606 with respect to the incident as a whole and, where appropriate, each individual 
defendant. In weighing the nature and circumstances of the 
offense, the court referenced several factual grounds for its 
decision. Based on those considerations, the court reasonably 
concluded that the offense was extreme in its brutality. It 
found that when Sauceda and his brother arrived at the scene, a 
"mob mentality" developed, resulting in an unjustifiable use of 
force against the complaining witness that could have resulted in 
serious bodily injury or death. Although the court never 
expressly stated that it discredited Sauceda's account of what 
happened, such a determination is implicit in its findings. And, 
as Sauceda recognizes in his opening brief, the Circuit Court was 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
entitled to rely on the presentence investigation report rather 
than Sauceda's version of events. See Hussein, 122 Hawai' i at 
525-26, 229 P.3d at 343-44. 
Likewise, in its written order imposing consecutive
 
sentencing, the Circuit Court expressly found that Sauceda had
 arrived at the scene with his brother. Sauceda was armed with a
 
baseball bat and struck the complaining witness in the rib cage
 
with a full swing. He participated in a further beating,
 
displaying extreme and unjustifiable violence. The court
 
therefore adopted the complaining witness's version of events,
 
implicitly discrediting Sauceda's version. In making these
 
findings, the court expressly considered the presentence
 
investigation report and addendum; the entire record; and the
 
exhibits, statements, and arguments presented at the sentencing
 
hearing.
 
At the hearing on his motion to reduce the sentence,
 
Sauceda largely reiterated the same version of events that his
 
counsel had argued at the sentencing hearing. The Circuit Court
 
again implicitly declined to find Sauceda's version credible,
 
stating that it had "weighed very seriously" all of the statutory
 
factors and had reached the appropriate sentence. The court
 
expressly noted that it had considered Sauceda's statement in
 
support of the motion. We conclude that the Circuit Court did
 
not abuse its discretion in denying Sauceda's motion to reduce
 
the sentence.
 
Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Circuit Court's
 
May 4, 2010 Judgment, without prejudice, to a subsequent HRPP
 
Rule 40 petition on Sauceda's ineffective assistance of counsel 
4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
claim. We also affirm the Circuit Court's September 30, 2010
 
Order Denying Defendant's Motion to Reduce Sentence.
