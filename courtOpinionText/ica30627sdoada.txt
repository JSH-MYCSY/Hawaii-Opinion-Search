Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 
Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed on September 21, 2009. 
On that date, the circuit court also entered a Judgment on
 
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting
 
Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure
 
Against All Defendants on Complaint Filed on September 21, 2009, 
pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure
 
(HRCP); no appeal from that judgment was taken by HIC.
 
On June 23, 2010, the circuit court entered an Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale by
 
Commissioner and the Judgment, which were entered pursuant to
 
HRCP Rule 54(b).
 
On appeal, HIC contends the circuit court erred by
 
holding that HIC and all other defendants in the foreclosure
 
action were "barred of and from any and all right, title and
 
interest in and to the property."
 
Behpour contends (1) this court lacks jurisdiction
 
because the appeal was untimely and (2) the appeal lacks merit.2
 
This court does not lack jurisdiction because HIC's
 
appeal was timely. See Hawaii Revised Statutes §§ 667-51(a)(2)
 
(Supp. 2010) and 641-1(a) (Supp. 2010).
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
conclude that HIC's appeal is without merit.
 
HIC did not appeal the decree of foreclosure and
 
judgment issued on February 17, 2010. Therefore, HIC does not
 
have an interest in the subject property. In the circuit court,
 
HIC's sole argument against confirmation of the sale was that the
 
foreclosure action was "a contrived action designed to defraud a

creditor, [HIC]." HIC makes that same argument on appeal. HIC
 
made no valid objection to the sale and confirmation of the
 
property in the circuit court or on appeal. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment re: Order
 
Granting Plaintiff's Motion for Confirmation of Sale by
 Commissioner filed on June 23, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the
 
First Circuit is affirmed.
