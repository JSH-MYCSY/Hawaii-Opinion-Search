NO. 30629

IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS

OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
JOHN FITZGERALD FINNIGAN, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

(S.P.P. NO. 10-1-0005; CRIMINAL NO. 91-1160
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER

(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant John Finnigan (Finnigan) appeals

from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Denying

Petition for Post-Conviction Relief (Order Denying Post-
Conviction Relief), filed on July 2, 2010, in the Circuit Court

of the First Circuit (Circuit Court).
1

On August 24, 1994, Finnigan was convicted of Murder in 
the Second Degree and sentenced to life with the possibility of 
parole.  On November 14, 1996, in Appeal No. 18441, Finnigan's 
conviction was affirmed by the Hawai' i Supreme Court. 
On January 21, 2010, Finnigan filed a Petition to

Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Judgment or to Release Petitioner

from Custody (Petition), pursuant to Rule 40 of the Hawaii Rules

of Penal Precedure (HRPP). The Petition stated four grounds for
 
relief as follows:

1

The Honorable Michael D. Wilson presided.

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
A. Ground One: Conviction obtained by the
unconstitutional failure of the prosecution to
disclose to the defendant evidence favorable to the
 defendant.
 
State supporting FACTS (do not cite cases or law):
Prosecutor withheld evidence from defendant of
 military investigation.
 
Ground Two: Violation of due process rights.
 State supporting FACTS (do not cite cases or law): Pre
Sentence Investigation (PSI) never completed.
 
Ground Three: Violation of constitutional right to
fair and equal treatment.
 
State supporting FACTS (do not cite cases or law):
Constitutional right violated as Hawaii Paroling
Authority (HPA) failed to comply with statutorily
required procedural requirements.
 
Ground Four: Petitioner seek relief for due process
violation.
 
State supporting FACTS (do not cite cases or law):
Equal protection right violated as HPA deviated from
established minimum term rules.
 
In the Order Denying Post-Conviction Relief, the
 
Circuit Court denied Finnigan's Petition without a hearing. 
On appeal, Finnigan contends:
 
1.	 The court erred in presuming that no military
investigation was conducted as protocol requires such
an investigation;
 
2.	 The court erred in finding no merit in a complete Pre-
sentence Investigation when deciding a Minimum Term(s)
of Incarceration as a matter of Due Process;
 
3.	 The court erred in misinterpreting the involvement of
Fair and Equal Treatment when the HPA fails to comply
with statutorial procedural requirements by
classifying the Petitioner as a Level III without
written justification explaining the deviation;
 
4.	 The court erred in concluding ground four "[. . .]
should be dismissed without prejudice or transferred
to the civil courts";
 
5.	 The court erred in denying to hear more regarding the
military investigation when there exists a real chance
of exoneration and/or possible prosecutorial
misconduct;
 
6.	 The court erred in stating that the "Petitioner did
not file any pleadings with the HPA[.]"

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs

submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we

resolve Finnigan's points of error as follows:

(1) & (5) Finnigan presented no argument on appeal
 
with respect to ground one of the Petition. Instead, Finnigan
 
requests that "ground one be dismissed without prejudice allowing

the issue to be addressed in a separate Petition," because the

possibility of exoneration exists by way of a copy of a military

investigation report. Finnigan's Petition stated that the
 
prosecution withheld evidence of a military investigation report. 
 
Finnigan presented no evidence that the prosecution withheld such

information from him. The Circuit Court did not err in finding

that ground one of the Petition to be patently frivolous and

without a trace of support in the record.2

(2) The State acknowledges that a pre-sentence
 
investigation report was not fully completed. However, the State
 
presented evidence that the incomplete portion of the pre-
sentence investigation report was because Finnigan "verbally

informed this officer that he meant no disrespect to the Court,

but on the advice of his attorney, he would not complete the pre-
sentence questionnaire and would not answer any questions

pertaining to the offense because of an appeal that has been

filed in his case." Finnigan does not dispute that he refused to

answer questions that were posed in order to complete the pre-
sentence investigation report and that is the only reason why the

report is incomplete. 
 
On appeal, Finnigan claims that the failure by the

Hawaii Paroling Authority (HPA) to complete a pre-sentence

2

Ground one of the Petition will not be dismissed without

prejudice. We note, however, that Finnigan may be able to file another
petition, pursuant to HRPP Rule 40, based on newly discovered evidence, if he
can find a copy of a military investigation report. We express no opinion on
whether this alternative argument might be consider waived, or whether it
might have any merit. 
 
3 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
investigation report under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706­
602 violates his due process rights because the pre-sentence

investigation report "is an important tool by which the HPA uses

to help determine an inmate's Minimum Term(s) of Incarceration."

First, it is the court, not HPA, that is statutorily charged with

overseeing the completion of the pre-sentence investigation

report. Moreover, Finnegan did not present any evidence, and
 
there is no indication in the record, that any part of the report

was incomplete other than the information that he opted not to

provide, that he ever requested a more complete report be

prepared prior to the 2004 hearing, or that he objected to the

partial report prior to the 2004 hearing. Therefore, the Circuit
 
Court did not err in concluding that ground two was patently

frivolous and without support in the record.

(3) The Petition failed to set forth which statutorily
 
required procedures the HPA violated. On appeal, Finnigan claims
 
that the HPA failed to follow statutorily required procedures in

HRS § 706-604(1), which allows him to be heard and to refute

incorrect information in a pre-sentence investigation report. 
 
HRS § 706-604(1) states that "the court shall afford a fair

opportunity to the defendant to be heard on the issue of the

defendant's disposition," and allow the defendant to controvert

or supplement a pre-sentence investigation report when imposing a

sentence. The statutory requirements of HRS § 706-604(1) only

applies to the court, and not HPA. Therefore, the Circuit Court
 
did not err in finding that ground three was patently frivolous

and without support in the record.

(4) In the Petition, Finnigan failed to allege how HPA
 
deviated from established minimum term rules. Only on appeal

does Finnigan state that the HPA failed to adequately consider

all of the factors when determining that he was a Level III

offender instead of a Level I offender. These new allegations

and supporting documents submitted by Finnigan on appeal were not

4 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
considered by the Circuit Court. Finnigan cannot point to where 
in the record on appeal he claimed the HPA failed to adequately 
consider all of the factors when determining that he was a Level 
III offender. Therefore, this point of error is waived. See 
Hawai'i Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4). 
(6) Finnegan makes no argument regarding his sixth point of

error. Therefore, this point of error is waived. See HRAP Rule

28(b)(7).

For these reasons, the Circuit Court's July 2, 2010 
Order Denying Post-Conviction Relief is affirmed.
