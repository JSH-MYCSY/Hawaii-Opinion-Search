NO. 30630
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
COUNTY OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v. 
H. KIMURA STORE, INC., IRENE KIMURA,
BRIAN KIMURA, Defendants-Appellees,
and 
MICHAEL TIERNEY, Defendant-Appellant 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 00-1-0377)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Upon review of Defendant-Appellant Michael Tierney's 
("Tierney") September 29, 2010 jurisdictional statement; 
Tierney's Response to Order Requiring Supplemental Brief, filed December 8, 2010; the supplemental brief filed on January 3, 2011, by Plaintiff-Appellee County of Hawai
'i ("County"); and the 
record on appeal; it appears that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction over Tierney's appeal from the July 1, 2010 Order Denying Defendant's Motion For Return of Property $5,000, Filed on April 7, 2010 filed in the Circuit Court of the Third Circuit 
1
("Circuit Court")  ("July 1, 2010 Denial Order").  We lack
 
jurisdiction because the Circuit Court has not entered a
 judgment, "a decree [or] any order from which an appeal lies"

under Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 54(a). 
The County's September 14, 2000, Complaint in 
Interpleader sought to determine the disposition of currency 
recovered as evidence by the Hawai' i Police Department during a 
theft investigation. Tierney was one of the defendants in the interpleader action. As Tierney was not served with the complaint, however, the Circuit Court issued a Final Order of Dismissal (as to Tierney) on June 7, 2001 ("June 7, 2001 Order"). On July 30, 2001, the Circuit Court issued an Order of Dismissal, dismissing the entire case for failure to prosecute ("July 30, 2001 Order"). Neither order was reduced to a separate document as required by HRCP Rule 58.

Almost nine years later, on April 7, 2010, Tierney
 
filed a Motion for Return Of Property $5,000, in which he sought
 return of the currency addressed in the County's interpleader
 action. The Circuit Court, advising that it was treating
 Tierney's motion as a motion under HRCP Rule 60(b), issued its
 July 1, 2010 Denial Order. Tierney appealed.
 
"An order denying a motion for post-judgment relief 
under HRCP [Rule] 60(b) is an appealable final order under HRS ยง 641-1(a)." Ditto v. McCurdy, 103 Hawai' i 153, 160, 80 P.3d 
974, 981 (2003) (citing First Trust Co. of Hilo v. Reinhardt, 3

 "Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." Haw.
 
R. Civ. P. 58. "An appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been
reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and
against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338
(1994). "An appeal from an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor
of or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court
will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote omitted).
Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable whenthe order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford v. City and County of 
Honolulu, 109 Hawai' i 14, 20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005).

Haw. App. 589, 592, 655 P.2d 891, 893 (1982)). We conclude,
 
however, that Tierney's motion was not properly a motion for
 "post-judgment relief" and the July 1, 2010 Denial Order is not a
 "post-judgment order" because there was no underlying judgment. 
Whether the underlying order in this case is the June 7, 2001
 Order or the July 30, 2001 Order, the July 1, 2010 Denial Order
 does not deny a motion for post-judgment relief because the
 Circuit Court has not entered a judgment, "a decree [or] any
 order from which an appeal lies." Haw. R. Civ. P. 54(a). 
Under HRCP Rule 54(b),
 
the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one
or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only
 upon an express determination that there is no just reason
 
for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of
judgment. In the absence of such determination and
direction, any order or other form of decision, however
designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or
the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties
shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or
parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject
 to revision at any time before the entry of judgment
adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities
of all the parties.
 
(Emphasis added). In other words, in the absence of a separate
 
and distinct "judgment," the circuit court has very broad
 discretion to modify or set aside an order because any "order or
 other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before
 the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights
 and liabilities of all the parties." Haw. R. Civ. P. 54(b). 
Although the Circuit Court treated the April 7, 2010
 
Motion for Return of Property $5,000 as a Rule 60(b) motion,
 "Rule 60(b) . . . applies only to motions attacking final,
 appealable orders[.]" United States v. Martin, 226 F.3d 1042,
 
1048 n.8 (9th Cir. 2000). Since neither the June 7, 2001 Order
 or the July 30, 2001 Order were reduced to a separate judgment,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
there is no final, appealable "judgment" in this case.3
 
In sum, the Circuit Court has not entered a final 
judgment in the case that is appealable pursuant to HRS 
ยง 641-1(a), HRCP Rule 58, and the holding in Jenkins, 76 Hawai' i 
at 119, 869 P.2d at 1338. As there is no underlying "judgment," the July 1, 2010 Denial Order is not a "post-judgment order" and an appeal can not be taken. 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is 
dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, September 1, 2011.

 In light of the time that has passed without entry of a judgment in
the case, we anticipate that the Circuit Court will issue a judgment forthwith
upon receipt of this order.
