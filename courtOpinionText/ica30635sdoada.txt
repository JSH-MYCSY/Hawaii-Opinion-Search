OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
MICHAEL C. TIERNEY, Petitioner-Appellant, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Respondent-Appellee
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(S.P.P. NO. 10-1-0018 (Cr. No. 08-1-0869))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Petitioner-Appellant Michael C. Tierney (Tierney)
 
appeals from the Order Dismissing Petition for Post-Conviction
 
Relief filed on July 7, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First
 
1
 (circuit court).
 Circuit
On March 25, 2010, Tierney filed a Petition for Writ of
 
Habeas Corpus (Petition). 
On March 30, 2010, the circuit court
 
filed an Order Designating Motion as Nonconforming Petition for
 
Post-Conviction Relief and Directing Petitioner to File
 
Supplemental Petition. In a letter dated March 30, 2010, Tierney
 
was informed that the Petition was assigned S.P.P. No. 10-1-0018
 
and would be treated as a nonconforming Petition for Post-
Conviction Relief pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure
 
(HRPP) Rule 40(c)(2). Tierney was informed that the enclosed

Form A -- Petition for Post-Conviction Relief -- should be
 
filled out and submitted to the circuit court. Tierney was also
 
provided a copy of Form B - Request to Proceed without Paying
 
Filing Fees. The letter warned Tierney that "[f]ailure to submit
 
the documents by May 31, 2010 may result in your petition being
 
dismissed."
 
On July 7, 2010, the circuit court issued the Order
 
Dismissing Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, which dismissed
 
the Petition for failure to comply with the circuit court's
 
March 30, 2010 Order Designating Motion as Nonconforming Petition
 
for Post-Conviction Relief and Directing Petitioner to File
 
Supplemental Petition.
 
On appeal, Tierney contends he was denied meaningful
 
access to the courts to challenge violations of his
 
constitutional rights and asks for a review of the Petition on
 
the merits.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Tierney's appeal is without merit.
 
The Petition provided inadequate information to
 
evaluate Tierney's claim that his parole was improperly denied. 
Therefore, the circuit court properly treated the Petition as
 
nonconforming and ordered Tierney to complete Form A so that
 
additional information could be obtained before the court ruled
 
on the merits of the Petition. HRPP Rule 40(c)(2). The circuit
 
court provided Tierney with a copy of Form A and warned Tierney
 
that failure to comply could result in dismissal of the Petition. 
Tierney failed to comply with the circuit court's order to
 
supplement the Petition. Therefore, under HRPP Rule 40(e), the
 
circuit court was empowered to dismiss the Petition because
 
Tierney failed to clarify the Petition after being provided the
 
opportunity to do so. Tierney provided no valid reason for not

following the circuit court's Order Designating Motion as
 
Nonconforming Petition for Post-Conviction Relief and Directing
 
Petitioner to File Supplemental Petition.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Order Dismissing Petition
 
for Post-Conviction Relief filed on July 7, 2010 in the Circuit
 Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
