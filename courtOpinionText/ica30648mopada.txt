STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
TRACY GRAY, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-CR NO. 10-1-1137)
 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Tracy Gray ("Gray") appeals from
 
the July 29, 2010 Judgment of Conviction and Sentence; Notice of
 
Entry ("Judgment") of the Family Court of the First Circuit
 ("Family Court").
1 Gray was convicted on two counts of Criminal
 
Contempt of Court in violation of sections 710-1077(1)(g) and
 
2
(3)(b), Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS")  and was sentenced to six

2 Criminal contempt of court. (1) A person
commits the offense of criminal contempt of court if:
 
. . . . 
(g)	 The person knowingly disobeys or resists the
process, injunction, or other mandate of a
court;
 
. . . .
 
(3) The court may treat the commission of an offense
under subsection (1) as a petty misdemeanor, in which case:
 
. . . . 
(b)	 If the offense was not committed in the
 
immediate view and presence of the court, nor
under such circumstances that the court has
 knowledge of all of the facts constituting the
offense, the court shall order the defendant to

months of probation and five days in jail on each count, with the
 
counts to run consecutively. Gray's jail sentence was stayed
 pending the outcome of this appeal. 
Gray raises two points of alleged error: (1) that the
 
two counts of contempt for which he was charged and convicted
 
3
merged under HRS § 701-109(e)  and were based on the same
evidence in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth
 Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I,
 section 10 of the Hawaii Constitution; and (2) that it was not
 within the Family Court's discretion to condition its stay of
 Gray's sentence pending appeal on Gray filing his notice of
 appeal within one business day of the Judgment. 
We conclude that the two counts of contempt merged. 
Therefore, we vacate Gray's conviction on the second count and
 remand to the Family Court for re-sentencing.
 
I.	 BACKGROUND
 
A.	 The Order for Protection
 Gray and the complaining witness ("CW") were previously 
married and had two children together, AG and JG. On
 
September 25, 2008, CW obtained an order for protection against

AW. REV. STAT. § 710-1077(1)(g), and (3)(b) (1993).
 
3	 HRS § 701-109(1)(e) provides: 
When the same conduct of a defendant may establish an
element of more than one offense, the defendant may be
prosecuted for each offense of which such conduct is an
element. The defendant may not, however, be convicted of
more than one offense if:
 
. . . . 
(e)	 The offense is defined as a continuing course of
conduct and the defendant's course of conduct
 was uninterrupted, unless the law provides that
specific periods of conduct constitute separate
offenses.

Gray ("Order for Protection"). The Order for Protection
 
prohibited Gray from contacting CW or any children who resided
 with CW either directly or through third parties. On February 4,
 2009, the Order for Protection was amended to remove AG and JG,
 and to allow for limited contact between Gray and CW for purposes
 of arranging visitation or in case of emergencies involving the
 children. 
B. Complaint, Proceedings and Judgment
 
On February 8, 2010, the State filed a complaint 
charging Gray with two counts of Violation of an Order for
 
Protection under HRS § 586-11(a)(1)(A). On July 7, 2010, the
 State filed an amended complaint that amended the charges to two
 counts of Criminal Contempt of Court.
4 On July 29, 2010, a bench
 
trial was held. 
In its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and
 
Adjudication of Guilt, filed September 14, 2010, the Family Court
 found the following findings of fact ("FOF"): 
Findings of Fact
 
7. One evening in late January 2010, [JG] and [AG]
went to dinner at Bravo Restaurant with Defendant and
 
Defendant's family.
 
8. While at dinner, [AG] wanted a picture of
Defendant for the caller ID on his cellular phone.
 
9. Defendant willingly allowed [AG] to take his
picture.
 
10. Defendant posed for the photograph by sticking up
the middle finger on his right hand.
 
11. [AG] used his cellular phone and took a photograph
of Defendant sticking up the middle finger of his right
hand.
 
12. Defendant then stuck up the middle fingers of both
his hands.
 
13. [JG] took a photograph with his cellular phone of

 The difference between charging Gray with violating an order of
protection and charging him with criminal contempt of court is the Family
Court's ability to sentence Gray to five days in jail on each contempt count
versus two days of jail on each violation of a protection order count. Having
maximized the sentencing possibilities, the State nevertheless sought to use
the fact that it originally charged Gray with criminal contempt as a basis
upon which, it argued, the Family Court should deny Gray a stay of sentence
pending appeal.

Defendant with the middle fingers of both hands sticking
up.5
 
. . . . 
15. Defendant told [JG] and [AG] to show the
photographs on their phones that depicted Defendant sticking
up his middle fingers to their mother [CW].
 
. . . . 
24. [AG] initially thought Defendant told him to show the
picture to his mother; but the more he thought about it, he
changed his mind, and stated that Defendant did not tell him to
show his mother.
 
. . . .
 
29. On or about January 30, 2010, [AG] and [JG] told
[CW] that they had something on their phones that Defendant
said to show [CW], and that it was from Defendant to [CW].
 
30. [CW] looked at [AG's] and [JG]'s phones and saw
the photographs of Defendant sticking up his middle fingers.
 
Furthermore, the Family Court adopted the following
 
conclusions of law ("COL"):
 
Conclusions of Law
 
3. Defendant knowingly violated the Order for
Protection when he told [AG] to show the picture of
Defendant sticking his middle finger to [CW], and this act
constituted a third party communication by Defendant to [CW]
through [AG].
 
4. Defendant knowingly violated the Order when he told
[JG] to show the picture of Defendant sticking his middle
fingers to [CW], and this act constituted a third party
communication by Defendant to [CW] through [JG].
 
. . . .
 
10. From Defendant's testimony that he did not care if
[AG] and [JG] showed the photographs to their mother, it can
be reasonably inferred that Defendant told [AG] and [JG] to
show [CW] [the pictures].
 
. . . .
 
12 [JG]'s testimony was credible. His testimony was
corroborated by [CW].
 
13. [AG]'s testimony was not credible because he
changed his story and recanted because he loves Defendant
and wants to protect him.

 Gray objected to FOF 13, contending that it was incomplete to the
extent that it did not note that both AG and JG, using their respective
telephones, took photographs of their father with the middle fingers of both
of his hands sticking up. We need not resolve that issue in order to conclude
 that the two counts merged.

Consequently, the Family Court found Gray guilty on the
 
amended charges. 
C. Sentence and Bail Pending Appeal
 
Following trial, the Family Court sentenced Gray to six
 
months of probation. Special conditions of probation included
 
the requirement that Gray serve a five day term of imprisonment
 for each count, to run consecutively, for a total of ten days. 
The Family Court initially denied Gray's counsel's motion to stay
 the sentence pending appeal, but subsequently agreed to stay
 execution of the mittimus if Gray filed a notice of appeal by
 Monday August 2, 2010. Gray filed his notice of appeal on Friday
 July 30, 2010. 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
Plain Error/Rule 52(b) 
Hawai'i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 52(b) states that 
"[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be 
noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court." Therefore, an appellate court "may recognize plain error when the error committed affects substantial rights of the defendant." State v. Staley, 91 Hawai' i 275, 282, 982 P.2d 904, 
911 (1999) (quoting State v. Cullen, 86 Hawai' i 1, 8, 946 P.2d 
955, 962 (1997)). 
Finding Of Facts/Conclusions Of Law
 
A trial court's findings of fact are reviewed under the 
"clearly erroneous" standard of review. Dan v. State, 76 Hawai' i 
423, 428, 879 P.2d 528, 533 (1994). "A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when (1) the record lacks substantial evidence to support the finding, or (2) despite substantial evidence in support of the finding, the appellate court is nonetheless left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made." State v. Locquiao, 100 Hawai' i 195, 203 58 P.3d 1242, 
1250 (2002) (quoting State v. Harada, 98 Hawai' i 18, 22, 41 P.3d 
174, 178 (2002)). 
"An appellate court may freely review conclusions of
 
5
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
law and the applicable standard of review is the right/wrong 
test. A conclusion of law that is supported by the trial court’s findings of fact and that reflects an application of the correct rule of law will not be overturned." Dan, 76 Hawai' i at 428, 879 
P.2d at 533 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A. The Two Counts Merged Under HRS § 701-109(1)(e) 
Gray argues that he committed only one contempt offense 
and that the trial court erred when it failed to recognize that
 
the two counts should have been merged into a single offense.
6
 
To the contrary, the State argues that "two separate criminal
 acts occurred" when Gray: (1) posed for his son AG; (2) posed for
 his son JG; and (3) "told [AG] and [JG] to show the photos to
 [CW], thereby generating two separate communications to [CW]
 through two separate third parties." The State contends that
 Gray's conduct was analogous to writing two messages, handing the
 two messages to two different messengers, and then simultaneously
 telling them to deliver the messages. The merger doctrine did
 not apply, the State claims, because the prosecution did not rely
 upon evidence of the same conduct to establish the two offenses. 
The Family Court concluded in its COL 3 and COL 4 that
 
the act of Gray telling his children to show the picture(s) to CW
 each "constituted a third party communication" to CW and,
 therefore, twice violated the Order for Protection. Even though
 we are obliged to accept unchallenged FOF and COL as binding,
7
 
the evidence establishes that Gray's course of conduct was
 
6 Gray did not raise the issue below; nevertheless, we review
possible violations of HRS § 701-109 for plain error. State v. Richie, 88
Hawai'i 19, 33 n.6, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 n.6 (1998); State v. Alston, 75 Haw.
517, 529–30, 865 P.2d 157, 164–65 (1994). 
7
 JG's testimony, which the Family Court concluded was credible, did
not support a finding that Gray "told [JG] and [AG] to show the photographs on
their phones . . . to their mother [CW]" or a conclusion that "Defendant'stestimony that he did not care if [AG] and [JG] showed the photographs totheir mother, it can be reasonably inferred that Defendant told [AG] and [JG]to show [CW]," Gray, however, does not challenge either FOF 15 or COL 10 on
appeal. As such, we accept the finding and the conclusion as binding.  Okada 
Trucking Co. v. Bd. of Water Supply, 97 Hawai' i 450, 458, 40 P.3d 73, 81
(2002) (findings); Alvarez Family Trust v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Kaanapali Alii, 121 Hawai' i 474, 489, 221 P.3d 452, 467 (2009) (conclusions).

uninterrupted and directed to a single criminal goal.
 
"Whether a course of conduct gives rise to more than 
one crime within the meaning of HRS § 701-109(1)(e) depends in 
part on the intent and objective of the defendant. The test to determine whether the defendant intended to commit more than one offense is whether the evidence discloses one general intent or discloses separate and distinct intents. Where there is one intention, one general impulse, and one plan, there is but one offense." State v. Frisbee, 114 Hawai' i 76, 81, 156 P.3d 1182, 
1187 (2007) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Matias, 102 Hawai'i 300, 305, 75 P.3d 1191, 1196 (2003)). "HRS § 701­
109(1)(e), however, does not apply where a defendant's actions constitute separate offenses under the law." Id. 
The cases offered by the State in support of its 
position are largely inapposite. In State v. Pia, 55 Haw. 14, 514 P.2d 580 (1973), for instance, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held 
that separate punishment was appropriate where count two (willful interference with a police officer) related to the defendant's response to an attempt by the police officer to subdue a roadside affray and to arrest the defendant, while count one (assault on a police officer in the performance of his duties) related to defendant's conduct a short time later when the officer attempted to call for assistance from the opposite side of the road. 55 Haw. at 16–17, 514 P.2d at 583. Similarly, sexual assault is not treated as a continuing offense and each act constituting a separate assault is separately punishable. See State v. Caprio, 
85 Hawai' i 92, 104–05, 937 P.2d 933, 945-46 (App. 1997), 
overruled on other grounds by State v. Feliciano, 107 Hawai' i 
469, 479, n.17, 115 P.3d 648, 658 n.17 (2005) (five counts of sexual assault permitted); Hamill v. State, 602 P.2d 1212 (Wyo. 1979) (even if the incidents of sexual assault are closely related in place and time, each of the statutorily enumerated acts are distinct and individual and subject to individual prosecution); Harrell v. State, 277 N.W.2d 462 (Wis. Ct. App. 1979) (second incident occurred after an interval of twenty-five minutes). 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The critical question is whether the State relies on
 
one act by the defendant to establish both statutory offenses. 
Unlike the State's two-messages-to-two-messengers analogy, Gray
 did not write separate messages intended for CW and hand them to
 his two messengers. Rather, Gray allowed the boys, at their
 request, to take his picture. The evidence establishes that the
 pictures were taken, not with an eye toward communicating with
 CW, but to become part of the caller ID on the children's
 telephones. Thus, even if we accept, as we must, that "Defendant
 told [AG] and [JG] to show [CW the photographs]," the evidence
 establishes that he did so only in a single communication
 directed to AG. As such, we conclude that the scant time between
 photographs, the repetition of the same nonverbal communication
 (sticking up the middle finger), and the singular instruction to
 both children at the same time evidenced that Gray was motivated
 by one intention or plan and that there was no second act
 sufficient to permit separate prosecution. Therefore, the Family
 Court plainly erred in convicting Gray of two counts of contempt,
 and we need not address Gray's double jeopardy argument.
 
B.	 Whether the Family Court Erred in Requiring Gray to
File His Notice of Appeal Within One Business Day of
the Judgment's Filing is Moot
 
Gray's point of error concerning the Family Court's 
requirement that Gray file his notice of appeal within one 
business day of the Judgment's filing or suffer execution of the mittimus appears to be moot, and while we can find no statute, case law, or precedent authorizing the Family Court to condition a stay of sentence upon an expedited filing of the appellant's notice of appeal, we do not reach this issue. See State v. 
Kiese, No. 29792, 2011 WL 682258, at *12 (Hawai' i Ct. App. Feb. 
25, 2011) (holding that point on appeal in regards to the family court's denial of appellant's motion to stay his sentence is moot and, therefore, was not addressed). 
IV.	 CONCLUSION
 
The two counts of Criminal Contempt of Court in the
 
amended complaint are deemed to have merged under HRS § 701­

the case is remanded to the Family Court for re-sentencing.
