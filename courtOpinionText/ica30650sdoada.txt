NO. 30650
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
KERRY N. SANDERS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 04-1-2261)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kerry N. Sanders appeals from the
 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on July 6, 2010 in the
 
1
Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court).  The State 
of Hawai' i charged Sanders with Murder in the Second Degree; 
however, a jury convicted him of the included offense of 
Manslaughter, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes ยง 707-702 
(1993 & Supp. 2005). 
On appeal Sanders contends:
 (1) He was denied a fair trial because when a juror
 
became ill and the circuit court excused the juror, the court
 denied Sanders the opportunity to question the other jurors
 
regarding the impact of the juror's illness.
 
(2) The circuit court erred in refusing to give
 
Sanders' requested jury instructions on Assault in the Second
 
Degree and Assault in the Third Degree.

Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Sanders' appeal is without merit.
 
Sanders' argument that he was denied a fair trial is
 
unpersuasive, and he cites no supporting authority. There is
 
absolutely nothing in the record to suggest that Sanders' right
 
to a fair trial was in any way impaired by the juror's illness,
 
the circuit court's excusing of the juror, and the court's
 
refusal to question the remaining jurors regarding what impact
 
the juror's leaving may have had on them.
 
As to the requested jury instructions on assault, 
assuming arguendo that such instructions should have been given, 
such error was harmless because the jury convicted Sanders of the 
greater offense of Manslaughter. State v. Haanio, 94 Hawai' i 
405, 415-16, 16 P.3d 246, 256-57 (2001). 
Therefore,
 
The Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed on
 
July 6, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 affirmed.
