KEVIN K. ENOS, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NOS. 09-1-0523(2) and 10-1-0003(2))
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, and Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Kevin K. Enos (Enos) appeals from
 
the Judgment entered on July 8, 2010, by the Circuit Court of the
 
1
Second Circuit (Circuit Court)  in Cr. No. 09-1-0523(2) and Cr.
No. 10-1-0003(2). On appeal, Enos argues that the Circuit Court: 
(1)
 erred when it found that based on Enos's prior criminal
 
history, Enos could not be considered nonviolent; and (2) abused
 
its discretion in denying Enos's request to be sentenced to
 probation under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 706-622.5 (Supp.
 2010). We disagree and affirm the Circuit Court's Judgment.
 
I.
 
Enos was charged in Cr. No. 09-1-0523(2) with Promoting
 
a Dangerous Drug in the Second Degree (Count 1); Unlawful Use of
 Drug Paraphernalia (Count 2); and Promoting a Detrimental Drug in

NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Second Degree (Count 3). He was charged in Cr. No. 10-1­
0003(2) with the same three offenses under the same count
 numbers. Pursuant to a plea agreement with Plaintiff-Appellee
 State of Hawaii (State), Enos pleaded no contest to Counts 1 and
 2 in both Cr. No. 09-1-0523(2) and Cr. No. 10-1-0003(2). The
 plea agreement provided in part that "Mr. Enos is free to ask for
 sentencing under Act 44 (HRS 706-622.5) and the State is free to
 oppose it."
 
HRS § 706-622.5 gives the court discretion to sentence
 
certain first-time drug offenders to probation provided the
 person meets specified criteria. One of the required criteria
 is: "The court has determined that the person is nonviolent
 after reviewing the person's criminal history, the factual
 circumstances of the offense for which the person is being
 sentenced, and any other relevant information." HRS § 706­622.5(1)(a). 
Enos's criminal history includes (1) convictions for
 
Kidnapping, Terroristic Threatening in the First Degree, and
 Assault in the Third Degree, for which he was sentenced in 1995
 to concurrent terms of imprisonment of ten years, five years, and
 one year, respectively; (2) a conviction for Burglary in the
 First Degree, for which he was sentenced in 1996 to ten years of
 imprisonment; (3) a conviction for Assault in the Third Degree,
 for which he was sentenced in 1993 to one year of probation; 
and (4) a conviction for Abuse of a Family or Household Member,
 for which he was sentenced in 1987 to a suspended sentence. 
Enos's parole was revoked several times resulting in his
 reincarceration. 
Enos requested that he be sentenced to probation
 
pursuant to HRS § 706-622.5. Enos argued that despite his prior
 convictions for kidnapping, terroristic threatening, burglary,
 assault, and abuse of a family or household member, he should be
 deemed nonviolent because of the length of time that had passed
 since those convictions. Enos's counsel argued: "He did go to 
2

prison. He did get rehabilitated. And he hasn't had any violent
 
crimes since then." 
The Circuit Court found that because of the level of
 
Enos's history of violence, Enos did not qualify for sentencing
 under HRS § 706-622.5. The Circuit Court sentenced Enos to ten
 years of imprisonment on Count 1 and five years of imprisonment
 on Count 2 in both Cr. No. 09-1-0523(2) and Cr. No. 10-1-0003(2),
 all terms to be served concurrently.
 
II.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, we resolve the arguments raised by Enos
 on appeal as follows:
 
A.
 
The Circuit Court did not err when it found that based
 
on Enos's prior criminal history, Enos could not be considered
 nonviolent. HRS § 706-622.5(1)(a) specifically directs the
 sentencing court to consider a defendant's criminal history in
 determining whether the defendant is nonviolent. The record
 shows that Enos has a significant criminal history that includes
 convictions for Kidnapping, Terroristic Threatening in the First
 Degree, Burglary in the First Degree, Assault in the Third
 Degree, and Abuse of a Family or Household Member. These are
 offenses which involve violence, the threat of violence, or the
 serious risk of violence. Enos cites no persuasive authority
 for, and we reject, the contention that the passage of time since
 Enos's convictions precluded the Circuit Court from considering
 them in determining whether he was nonviolent.
2 We also reject
 
Enos's claim that the record must include details of how Enos's
 prior violent offenses were committed before the Circuit Court
 could consider them. 
2
 In addition, the record indicates that Enos spent a substantial
portion of the time between his prior convictions and his current offenses in
prison, pursuant to his original sentences and because of several parole
revocations. This diminishes the significance that may be attributed to the
passage of time since Enos's prior violent convictions. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
We disagree with Enos's contention that the Circuit
 
Court's finding that Enos did not qualify as nonviolent was not
 
supported by substantial evidence in the record. Given the
 nature and extent of Enos's prior criminal history, we conclude
 that there was substantial evidence to support the Circuit
 Court's finding and that this finding was not clearly erroneous.
 
B.
 
The Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in
 
denying Enos's request to be sentenced to probation under HRS 
§ 706-622.5. As noted, the Circuit Court did not err in finding
 that based Enos's prior criminal history, Enos did not qualify as
 nonviolent. Thus, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion
 in relying on that finding in rejecting Enos's request for
 sentencing under HRS § 706-622.5. Without a determination by the
 Circuit Court that Enos was nonviolent, Enos did not qualify for
 a probationary sentence under HRS § 706-622.5.
 
III.
 
We affirm the Judgment entered by the Circuit Court on
 
July 8, 2010, in Cr. No. 09-1-0523(2) and Cr. No. 10-1-0003(2).
