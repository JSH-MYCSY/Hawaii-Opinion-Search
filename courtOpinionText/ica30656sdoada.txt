STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
CHRISTOPHER J. KANG, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
HONOLULU DIVISION
 
(CRIMINAL CASE NO. 1P109-7960)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Christopher J. Kang (Kang) appeals
 
from the Notice of Entry of Judgment and/or Order (judgment) in
 
the District Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division
 
(District Court) dated April 27, 2010.1
 
Kang was found guilty of Assault in the Third Degree,
 
as a petty misdemeanor, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
(HRS) ยง 707-712(1)(a) and (2)(1993). This case arises out of
 
physical altercations on August 1, 2009, between Kang and
 
complaining witness Alan Imada (Imada). 
On appeal, Kang contends that the District Court erred
 
(1) in convicting him because there was insufficient evidence to

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
negate his claim of self-defense, (2) in admitting evidence of
 
Kang's prior arrest, and (3) in failing to obtain a proper waiver
 
from Kang of his right to pre-sentence allocution.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Kang's points of error as follows:
 
(1) There was substantial evidence to negate Kang's
 
claim of self-defense and to support his conviction for Assault
 
in the Third Degree as a petty misdemeanor.
 
In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence on appeal
. . . the test is whether, viewing the evidence in the light
most favorable to the State, substantial evidence exists to
support the conclusion of the trier of fact. "Substantial
 evidence" is credible evidence which is of sufficient
 quality and probative value to enable a person of reasonable
caution to reach a conclusion. In reviewing whether
substantial evidence exists to support a conviction,
moreover, due deference must be given to the right of the
trier of fact to determine credibility, weigh the evidence,
and draw reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced.
 
State v. Lubong, 77 Hawai' i 429, 432, 886 P.2d 766, 769 (App. 
1994) (citations omitted); see also State v. Agard, 113 Hawai' i 
321, 324, 151 P.3d 802, 805 (2007). 
Kang argues that, applying the two-part analysis
 
articulated in Lubong: (a) he had a subjective belief that use of
 
force for self-protection was necessary; and (b) it was
 
objectively reasonable that use of force was necessary for self-
protection. In this case, there was conflicting testimony as to
 
the altercations that occurred between Kang and Imada. However,
 
even assuming Kang had a subjective belief that use of force was
 
necessary for his self-protection, there was substantial evidence
 
to support a conclusion that a reasonable person in the same
 
situation would not have believed such force was necessary. For
 
example, outside of Exotic Nights, Kang testified he had jumped
 
on Imada's back and they were just goofing around, when they got
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
into a confrontation "about just random nonsense." According to 
Kang, Imada pushed him and Kang admitted he "got in [Imada's] 
face a little." According to Kang, Imada headlocked Kang and 
they tripped or somehow ended up on the ground where they 
wrestled for a few minutes. To the contrary, Imada testified 
that Kang headbutted him in the face, causing Imada to fall 
backwards, Imada grabbed hold of Kang, and they both fell to the 
ground. Imada also testified that while they were on the ground, 
Kang punched Imada in the stomach or grabbed "real hard" causing 
pain, and Kang then flipped Imada over causing Imada to hit his 
head on the gravel. Even under the circumstances Kang believed 
them to be, there was no reasonable basis to believe that a 
headbutt to Imada's face, a punch or hard grab to Imada's 
stomach, or flipping Imada over were necessary for self-
protection. Although Kang testified he did not headbutt Imada, 
and there was varying testimony regarding the altercations in the 
early morning hours of August 1, 2009, we give due deference to 
the District Court in assessing credibility, weighing the 
evidence and drawing reasonable inferences from the evidence. 
Lubong, 77 Hawai' i at 432, 886 P.2d at 769; see also In re Doe, 
107 Hawai' i 12, 19, 108 P.3d 966, 973 (2005). 
"As to whether the prosecution disproved [defendant's] 
claim of self defense beyond a reasonable doubt, '[e]ssentially, the prosecution does this when the trier of fact believes its 
case and disbelieves the defense.'" In re Doe, 107 Hawai' i at 
19, 108 P.3d at 973 (quoting State v. Pavao, 81 Hawai' i 142, 146, 
913 P.2d 553, 557 (App. 1996)); State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai' i 472, 
483, 927 P.2d 1355, 1366 (1996). Here, the District Court believed the State's case and disbelieved Kang's assertion of 
self-defense. 
(2) In this bench trial, the District Court did not err
 
by admitting evidence of Kang's prior arrest for Harassment in
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
July of 2009, the month prior to the incidents in this case, for 
the limited purpose of rebutting Kang's claim that Imada caused 
Kang's injuries and that Kang's injuries were not from another 
source. In a bench trial, "the normal rule is that if there is 
sufficient competent evidence to support the judgment or finding 
below, there is a presumption that any incompetent evidence was 
disregarded and the issue determined from a consideration of 
competent evidence only." State v. Montgomery, 103 Hawai' i 373, 
383, 82 P.3d 818, 828 (2003) (quoting State v. Gutierrez, 1 Haw. App. 268, 270, 618 P.2d 315, 317 (1980)). "When other-crimes 
evidence is introduced for a limited purpose, it is presumed that 
the trial judge considered it only for that purpose[.]" Id. 
(quoting People v. Deenadayalu, 331 Ill. App.3d 442, 265, Ill. Dec. 285, 772 N.E.2d 323, 329 (2002)). 
(3) Kang contends that the District Court violated 
Rule 32 of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) by not 
addressing Kang prior to sentencing and providing him with an opportunity to make a statement or present information in 
mitigation of punishment. The State agrees that this was a 
reversible error. Our review of the record confirms that Kang 
was not provided an opportunity to make a statement or present 
information in mitigation of punishment as required by HRPP Rule 
32 and State v. Schaefer, 117 Hawai' i 490, 498, 184 P.3d 805, 813 
(App. 2008). The required remedy is remand of the case for resentencing before a different judge. Id.; Schutter v. Soong, 
76 Hawai' i 187, 208, 873 P.2d 66, 87 (1994). 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the judgment by the District
 
Court of the First Circuit, Honolulu Division dated April 27,
 2010 is affirmed in part and vacated in part. Kang's conviction
 
for Assault in the Third Degree as a petty misdemeanor is

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
affirmed. However, Kang's sentence is vacated, and the case is
 
remanded for resentencing before a different judge.
