H.
 ISABELLE MCGARRY TRUST OF MARCH 19, 1971,
Plaintiff-Appellant, 
v.
 
STATE OF HAWAI 'I, STEPHEN WHITTAKER,
DAVID KAAPU, CARL VINCENTI, DAVID LACY, and BARBARA LACY,
Defendants-Appellees
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT

 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-0337K)
 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION

 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 

 Upon review of (1) Howard Hofelich's appeal from the
Honorable Ronald Ibarra's July 30, 2010 "Order Denying

 
Plaintiff's Motion for Default Judgment and Sua Sponte Order
 
Dismissing the Claim Against Defendant Carl Vincenti" (the
 July 30, 2010 interlocutory order), and (2) the record on appeal,
 it appears that we do not have jurisdiction over Appeal No. 30658
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
because the July 30, 2010 order is not an independently 
appealable order under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp. 2009).
1 HRS § 641-1(a) authorizes appeals to the 
intermediate court of appeals from final judgments, orders, or decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641­1(c). Rule 58 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)specifically requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a separate document." (Emphasis added.) Based on this requirement, the supreme court has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. 
Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 
1134, 1338 (1994). The separate judgment must "either resolve all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An appeal from 
an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor or against the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339 (footnote

 It also appears that Howard Hofelich may lack standing to assert
an appeal in this case because: (1) Howard Hofelich never obtained the circuit
court's permission to intervene as a party in this case pursuant to Rule 24 ofthe Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure; (2) Howard Hofelich has not provided
reliable evidence that he is the trustee of Plaintiff-Appellee H. IsabelleMcGarry Trust of March 19, 1971 an Illinois Trust; and (3) even if HowardHofelich is the trustee, Howard Hofelich is not licensed to practice law inHawai'i and appear on behalf of another person in litigation. See Abaya v. 
Mantell, 112 Hawai' i 176, 181, 145 P.3d 719, 724 (2006) (a person must be a
party to an action in order to assert an appeal); Oahu Plumbing and SheetMetal, Ltd. v. Kona Construction, Inc., 60 Haw. 372, 377, 590 P.2d 570, 573(1979) (persons who are not licensed to practice law in Hawai' i are not 
permitted to act as attorneys and represent other natural persons); TradewindsHotel, Inc. v. Cochran, 8 Haw. App. 256, 265, 799 P.2d 60, 66. (1990)(regarding a trustee representing a trust in litigation).

-3-omitted).  Consequently, "an order disposing of a circuit court
case is appealable when the order is reduced to a separate
judgment."  Alford v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai #i 14,
20, 122 P.3d 809, 815 (2005) (citation omitted; emphasis added).
On October 5, 2010, the appellate court clerk filed the
record on appeal for Appeal No. 30658, at which time there was no
separate and final judgment in the record on appeal for this
case.  Absent a separate and final judgment, this appeal is
premature and this court lacks jurisdiction.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that appellate court
case number 30658 is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai# i, November 22, 2010.
