APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 08-12649)

 
ORDER DISMISSING APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Foley and Leonard, JJ.)

 
Upon review of the record for this case, it appears
 
that we lack jurisdiction over the appeal that Defendant-
Appellant Brennon Morioka (Appellant Morioka) has asserted from
 the following three interlocutory orders(collectively referred to
 as "the three interlocutory orders"):
 
(1)	 an August 31, 2009 "ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT STATE OF
HAWAII'S MOTION FOR ORDER DISMISSING WITH PREJUDICE
 'FIRST CLAIM', [sic] SECOND CLAIM', [sic] THIRD
CLAIM', [sic] AND FOURTH CLAIM' OF THE COMPLAINT
AGAINST DEFENDANT STATE OF HAWAII, AND BRENNON

MORIOKA, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE GRANTING PARTIAL
SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF DEFENDANT STATE OF
 HAWAII, AND BRENNON MORIOKA ON THOSE CLAIMS"

(hereinafter referred to as "the August 31, 2009
interlocutory order");
 
(2)	 an April 9, 2010 "ORDERS [sic]: (1) DENYING
DEFENDANTS' BRENNON MORIOKA'S MOTION FOR
 RECONSIDERATION OF ORDER DENYING 'DEFENDANT STATE OF
 HAWAII'S MOTION FOR ORDER DISMISSING WITH PREJUDICE
 'FIRST CLAIM', [sic] SECOND CLAIM', [sic] THIRD
CLAIM', [sic] AND FOURTH CLAIM' OF THE COMPLAINT
AGAINST DEFENDANT STATE OF HAWAII, AND BRENNON

 HAWAII, [sic] AND BRENNON MORIOKA ON THOSE CLAIMS',
[sic] AND (2) GRANTING INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL, FILED
DECEMBER 17, 2009"
2 (hereinafter referred to as "the
April 9, 2010 interlocutory order"); and
 
(3)	 a July 14, 2010 "ORDERS [sic] (1) DENYING DEFENDANT
BRENNON MORIOKA'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF ORDER
 DENYING 'DEFENDANT STATE OF HAWAII'S MOTION FOR ORDER
 DISMISSING WITH PREJUDICE 'FIRST CLAIM', [sic] SECOND

THE COMPLAINT AGAINST DEFENDANT STATE OF HAWAII, AND

DECEMBER 17, 2009"  (hereinafter referred to as "the
July 14, 2010 interlocutory order").

 
As explained below, the circuit court has not yet reduced any of
 
these three interlocutory orders to a separate judgment that
 resolves at least one claim pursuant to Rule 54(b) and Rule 58 of
 the Hawai
'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP). 
Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) (1993 & Supp.
 
2009) authorizes appeals from final judgments, orders, or
 decrees. Appeals under HRS § 641-1 "shall be taken in the manner
 . . . provided by the rules of the court." HRS § 641-1(c). HRCP
 Rule 58 requires that "[e]very judgment shall be set forth on a
 separate document." Based on this requirement, the Supreme Court

of Hawai 'i has held that "[a]n appeal may be taken . . . only 
after the orders have been reduced to a judgment and the judgment 
has been entered in favor of and against the appropriate parties pursuant to HRCP [Rule] 58[.]" Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming 
& Wright, 76 Hawai
'i 115, 119, 869 P.2d 1334, 1338 (1994). 
[I]f a judgment purports to be the final judgment in a case
involving multiple claims or multiple parties, the judgment
(a) must specifically identify the party or parties for and
against whom the judgment is entered, and (b) must (i)
identify the claims for which it is entered, and
(ii) dismiss any claims not specifically identified[.]
 
Id. "[A]n appeal from any judgment will be dismissed as
 
premature if the judgment does not, on its face, either resolve
 
all claims against all parties or contain the finding necessary
 for certification under HRCP [Rule] 54(b)." Id. "An appeal from
 
an order that is not reduced to a judgment in favor of or against
 the party by the time the record is filed in the supreme court
 will be dismissed." Id. at 120, 869 P.2d at 1339.
 
As the titles of the three interlocutory orders 
indicate, none of the three interlocutory orders actually resolves a claim. Therefore, even if the circuit court intended to reduce the three interlocutory orders to a separate HRCP Rule 54(b)-certified judgment, then the resulting HRCP Rule 54(b)­certified judgment would not be appealable pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b), because HRCP Rule 54(b) "certification of finality is limited to only those cases where . . . the judgment entered completely disposes of at least one claim or all of the claims by or against at least one party." Elliot Megdal & Assocs. v. Daio 
USA Corp., 87 Hawai
'i 129, 133, 952 P.2d 886, 890 (App. 1998) 
(citation omitted).

A final decision for purposes of Rule 54(b)
generally is one which ends the litigation on the
merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but
execute the judgment. . . . When the plaintiff
retains the right to appear and assert additional
damages against the defendant . . . the judgment
cannot be viewed as final since finality implies that,
after entry of judgment, the court will concern itself
with nothing other than the mechanics of execution. .
. . In other words, the lower court may utilize its
Rule 54(b) powers with respect to a given claim only
if all damages stemming from that claim have been
fixed. . . . There is no material difference between
 an order that leaves all damages issues open . . . and
an order that leaves one, important damages issue
open.
 
Id. at 135, 952 P.2d at 892 (citations, internal quotation marks
 
and brackets omitted). As we have held previously, where a
 "circuit court did not fully adjudicate [a plaintiff]'s claim for
 damages, the circuit court erred in certifying the . . .
 [j]udgment in favor of [the plaintiff] as final pursuant to HRCP
 Rule 54(b)." Id.
 
In the instant case, none of the three interlocutory
 
orders fully adjudicates a claim in this case, and, thus, the
 circuit court could not certify any of the three interlocutory
 orders for a final judgment on one or more but fewer than all
 claims pursuant to HRCP Rule 54(b). Instead, the appropriate
 avenue, if any, for appellate review of the three interlocutory
 orders would have been certification for an interlocutory appeal
 pursuant to HRS § 641-1(b) (1993 & Supp. 2009), which authorizes
 interlocutory appeals to the intermediate court of appeals under
 the following limited circumstances:
 
(b) Upon application made within the time provided by
the rules of court, an appeal in a civil matter may be
allowed by a circuit court in its discretion from an order
denying a motion to dismiss or from any interlocutory
judgment, order, or decree whenever the circuit court may
think the same advisable for the speedy termination of
litigation before it. The refusal of the circuit court to
 allow an appeal from an interlocutory judgment, order, or
decree shall not be reviewable by any other court.
 
HRS § 641-1(b) (emphasis added).

In addition, even if any of the three interlocutory
 
orders would have fully adjudicated at least one claim in this
 
case, "an order disposing of a circuit court case is appealable
 [only] when the order is reduced to a separate judgment." Alford
 
v. City and Count of Honolulu, 109 Hawai
'i 14, 21, 122 P.3d 809, 
816 (2005) (citation omitted). Consequently, "a party cannot appeal from a circuit court order even though the order may contain [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language; the order must be reduced to a judgment and the [HRCP Rule] 54(b) certification language must be contained therein." Oppenheimer v. AIG Hawaii 
Ins. Co., 77 Hawai
'i 88, 93, 881 P.2d 1234, 1239 (1994). The 
circuit court has not entered a separate HRCP Rule 54(b)­certified judgment in this case. 
On October 6, 2010, the appellate court clerk filed the
 
record on appeal herein, at which time the record on appeal did
 not contain a separate appealable judgment. Absent an appealable
 final judgment, this appeal is premature and we lack appellate
 jurisdiction. 
Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appeal No. 30660 
is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
