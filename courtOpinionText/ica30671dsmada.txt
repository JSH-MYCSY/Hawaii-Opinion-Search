ORDER DISMISSING ALL APPEALS IN APPELLATE COURT
 
CASE NUMBER 30671 FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Upon review of (1) the record on appeal, (2) the
 
December 15, 2010 order consolidating Appeal Nos. 30671 and 30672
 
under Appeal No. 30671, and (3) the January 27, 2011 order
 
dismissing Appeal No. 30672, we enter this order of dismissal to
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
clarify that we dismiss all appeals in the consolidated appeals 
under Appeal No. 30671. It appears that we lack jurisdiction over (a) the appeal that Respondent-Appellant Helene Stone (Appellant Helene Stone) has asserted in Appeal No. 30671 from the Honorable Nancy Ryan's May 10, 2010 order for protection in FC-DA No. 10-1-0629 and (b) the appeal that Respondent-Appellant Kaulananapua Stone (Appellant Kaulananapua Stone) has asserted in Appeal No. 30672 from the Honorable Nancy Ryan's May 10, 2010 order for protection in FC-DA No. 10-1-0638, because both Appellant Helene Stone's appeal and Appellant Kaulananapua Stone's appeal are untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) and Rule 4(a)(4)(B) of the Hawai' i Rules of Appellate Procedure 
(HRAP). 
The two May 10, 2010 orders for protection in (1) FC-DA
 
No. 10-1-0629 and (2) FC-DA No. 10-1-0638, respectively, were
 appealable final orders pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 571-54 (2006), and the entry of the two May 10, 2010 orders for
 protection in FC-DA No. 10-1-0629 and FC-DA No. 10-1-0638
 triggered the thirty-day time period under HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) for
 filing timely notices of appeal. No party in either FC-DA No.
 10-1-0629 or FC-DA No. 10-1-0638 filed any tolling motions that
 would have extended the time period for filing a notice of appeal
 pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(3). The Honorable Gale L.F. Ching
 entered an August 4, 2010 order in (1) FC-DA No. 10-1-0629 and
 (2) FC-DA No. 10-1-0638, respectively, that purported to 
(1)	 grant Appellant Helene Stone's July 9, 2010 motion for
an extension to file a notice of appeal in FC-DA No.
10-1-0629 pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B), and
 
(2)	 grant Appellant Kaulananapua Stone's July 9, 2010
 
-2­NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
motion for an extension to file a notice of appeal in
FC-DA No. 10-1-0638 pursuant to HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B).
 
However, neither of the two August 4, 2010 orders complies with
 
the requirements for an extension under HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B)
 because both of the August 4, 2010 orders purport to grant an
 extension "exceed[ing] 30 days past the prescribed time." HRAP
 Rule 4(a)(4)(B). The rule states:
 
(B) Requests for extension of time after expiration of
the prescribed time. The court or agency appealed from,
upon a showing of excusable neglect, may extend the time for
filing the notice of appeal upon motion filed not later than
30 days after the expiration of the time prescribed by
subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this rule. However, no
such extension shall exceed 30 days past the prescribed
time. Notice of an extension motion filed after the
 expiration of the prescribed time shall be given to the
other parties in accordance with the rules of the court or
agency appealed from.
 
HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) (emphases added). Therefore, the two
 
August 4, 2010 orders purporting to grant extensions pursuant to
 HRAP Rule 4(a)(4)(B) are not valid. Appellant Helene Stone and
 Appellant Kaulananapua Stone did not file their respective
 August 5, 2010 notices of appeal within thirty days after entry
 of the May 10, 2010 orders for protection in FC-DA No. 10-1-0629
 and FC-DA No. 10-1-0638, as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required, and,
 thus, their appeals are untimely.
 
The failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a
 
civil matter is a jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot
 waive and the appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise
 of judicial discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727
 
P.2d 1127, 1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or
 justice is authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements
 contained in Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Consequently, we lack
 jurisdiction over Appellant Helene Stone's untimely appeal and

Appellant Kaulananapua Stone's untimely appeal.
 
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that all appeals in
 
the consolidated appeals under Appeal No. 30671 are dismissed for
 
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
