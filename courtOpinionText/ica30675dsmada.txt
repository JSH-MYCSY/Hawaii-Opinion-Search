IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I
 
In the Interest of S. CHILDREN
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 06-00652)
 
ORDER GRANTING MOTHER-APPELLANT’S
 UNOPPOSED MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Upon consideration of Mother-Appellant’s Unopposed
 
Motion to Dismiss Appeal, the papers in support, and the records
 
and files herein, it appears that: (1) Appellant is appealing
 from the order terminating parental rights and awarding permanent
 custody issued by the Family Court of the Fifth Circuit; 
(2)
 Appellant no longer wishes to pursue this appeal because it
 
seems the State intends to place the children for adoption with
 members of Appellant’s family, and Appellant does not want to
 interfere with or delay the adoption.

Therefore, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellant’s motion
 
is granted, and this appeal is dismissed. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, June 21, 2011.
