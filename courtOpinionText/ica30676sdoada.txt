IN THE INTEREST OF AU, MI
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NO. 10-00049)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Appellant-Mother (Mother) appeals from the Orders
 
Concerning Child Protective Act (Order), filed on July 20, 2010,
 
1
in the Family Court of the First Circuit (Family Court).  In the
 
Order, the Family Court, among other things, granted Department
 
of Human Services's (
DHS's) petition to place Mother's children,
 
2
AU  and MI (collectively, Children), in temporary foster custody
 
and granted DHS and Children's guardian ad litem the discretion
 
to allow Mother and Children's father (
Father) to have supervised
 
or unsupervised visitation with Children.
 
On appeal, Mother argues that the Family Court
 
erroneously granted DHS's petition for foster custody of Children

 
because the evidence did not establish that there was reasonable
 
cause to believe that foster custody was necessary to protect the

Children from imminent harm. Mother also argues that even if AU
 
was threatened with imminent harm while in Mother's care, there
 
was no evidence that MI was similarly endangered.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 
resolve Mother's points of error as follows:
 
Mother does not challenge any part of the Family
 
Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law entered on
 
September 23, 2010. The Family Court found, inter alia, that: 
(1) on April 20, 2010, AU (then age three and one-half) was found
 
by the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) wandering in the street
 
without adult supervision; (2) a neighbor reported that this was
 
the "sixth time" that AU was observed wandering around without
 
supervision; (3) a DHS crisis worker located Mother and returned
 
AU to Mother's custody; (4) on the next day, April 21, 2010, DHS
 
received another call reporting AU was wandering alone outside
 
her residence and HPD again found her and returned her home; (5)
 
on April 21, 2010, Social Worker Robert Asato visited the home
 
unannounced and assessed it as totally unkempt, in disarray, and
 
posing safety concerns for Children, and reported that Mother
 
presented to be mentally unstable; (6) in 2002, 2003 and 2004,
 
DHS received reports of physical neglect, and confirmed threats
 
of abuse and neglect, of two children previously born to Mother,
 
which ultimately resulted in termination of parental rights when
 
Mother failed to engage in services; (7) the Children had not
 
received adequate medical and dental attention while in Mother
 
and Father's care (e.g., AU needed major dental work on the
 
majority of her teeth and MI (age < 1 year old) was sick with
 
fever and diarrhea when removed from his parents' care and
 
required "several trips" to the emergency room for treatment) and
 
AU exhibited developmental delays; and (8) Mother and Father

subjected the Children to inadequate supervision and threatened
 
harm.
 
Based on the evidence presented, the Family Court 
reasonably concluded that the children faced imminent harm, 
pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes §§ 587-53(f) and 587-2 and 
other relevant parts of Hawai 'i's Child Protective Act. 
Accordingly, the Family Court's July 20, 2010 Order is
 
affirmed.
