IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
MANUEL D. SOUND and THOMPSON PHILLIP,
on behalf of themselves and all similarly
situated persons, Plaintiffs-Appellants, v.
STATE OF HAWAI' I, DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES,
LILLIAN B. KOLLER, in her capacity as Director of

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 09-1-2022-08)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
In an action challenging the validity of certain
 
administrative rules (
2009 COFA Rules), Plaintiffs/Appellants
 
Manuel D. Sound and Thompson Phillip (Plaintiffs) appeal from a
 
Circuit Court of the First Circuit (Circuit Court) post-judgment
 
"Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs"
 
filed on July 27, 2010 (Order Denying Fees).1
   
On August 31, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint
 
seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants-
Appellees State of Hawai
'i, Department of Human Services (DHS), 
Lillian B. Koller, and Dr. Kenneth Fink (collectively, the

State),  to prevent the State from implementing the 2009 COFA
Rules under two theories: 
(1) that the State's actions violated 
Article I, Sections 2 and 5 of the Hawai' i State Constitution; 
and (2) the 2009 COFA rules were promulgated in violation of the 
Hawai'i Administrative Procedure Act (HAPA), Hawaii Revised 
3
Statutes (HRS) § 91-3.  On January 26, 2010, the Circuit Court
 
granted partial summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on the
 
second of these grounds, declaring that the 2009 COFA Rules were
 
not adopted in conformity with HAPA and were, therefore, invalid. 
The constitutional claim was thereafter dismissed as moot. 
The
 
Circuit Court entered Final Judgment on April 19, 2010. The
 Circuit Court entered the Order Denying Fees on July 27, 2010,
 
without stating its reasoning for doing so. A notice of appeal
 
was timely filed.
 
On appeal, Plaintiffs argue that their request for
 
attorneys' fees was improperly denied, raising two points of
 
error: 
(1) the Circuit Court erred in denying Plaintiffs'
 
request for attorneys' fees under the common fund doctrine; and
 (2) the Circuit Court erred in denying Plaintiffs' request for
 
attorneys' fees under the private attorney general doctrine.
 
In conjunction with its other arguments, the State
 
repeatedly contends that Plaintiffs' request for attorneys' fees
 
"is simply a request for monetary damages against the State" and
 
2
 Lillian Koller and Dr. Fink were sued in their official capacities
as the DHS Director and the DHS Med-Quest Division Administrator,
respectively.

 HRS Chapter 91, known as the Hawai' i Administrative Procedure Act,
establishes the procedures which state and county governmental agencies mustfollow when they make rules. See HRS Chapter 91. HRS § 91-3 (2012)
articulates the clearly defined procedures for the adoption, amendment, orrepeal of rules by an administrative agency, and ensures public involvementand participation in the rulemaking process. In 2012, HRS § 91-3(b) wasamended to allow an agency to adopt, amend, or repeal a rule without priornotice or hearing or upon abbreviated notice and hearing for "imminent perilto natural resources." 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 149, §§ 1, 2 at 532. The procedure for the adoption, amendment, or repeal of rules under normalcircumstances was otherwise unchanged and identical to the statute then inforce during all times relevant to the instant proceeding. See id.

should not be allowed. Although poorly presented and supported
 
in the State's answering brief, this sovereign immunity argument
 
has merit.4 As the Hawai' i Supreme Court recently reaffirmed: 
Pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the
sovereign State is immune from suit for money damages,
except where there has been a clear relinquishment of
immunity and the State has consented to be sued. Bush v.
 
Watson, 81 Hawai' i 474, 481, 918 P.2d 1130, 1137 (1996)
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This
 
court has recognized that
 an award of costs and fees to a
 
prevailing party is inherently in the nature of a damage
award. Sierra Club v. Dept. of Trans. (Superferry II), 120
 
Hawai'i 181, 226, 202 P.3d 1226, 1271 (2009) (quotation
marks omitted) (quoting Fought & Co. v. Steel Eng'g &
Erection, Inc., 87 Hawai' i 37, 51, 951 P.2d 487, 501
(1998)). Accordingly, to properly award attorney's fees and
costs against the State, there must be 'a clear
relinquishment' of the State's immunity[.] Id. (quoting Bush
v. Watson, 81 Hawai' i 474, 481, 918 P.2d 1130, 1137 (1996). 
. . . 
This court has noted that the State has waived
 
immunity to suit only to the extent as specified in HRS
chapters 661 and 662. Taylor–Rice v. State, 105 Hawai
'i 
104, 110, 94 P.3d 659, 665 (2004) (citations omitted). HRS
 § 661–1(1) contains a limited waiver of sovereign immunity
for claims against the State of Hawai
'i that are founded 
upon a statute[.] Garner v. State, Dep't of Educ., 122
 
Hawai'i 150, 160, 223 P.3d 215, 225 (App. 2009). In 
determining the extent of the State's waiver of sovereign
immunity, this court relies on the following principles
derived from federal law:
 
(1) a waiver of the Government's sovereign
immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of
its scope, in favor of the sovereign; (2) a
waiver of sovereign immunity must be
unequivocally expressed in statutory text; (3) a
statute's legislative history cannot supply a
waiver that does not appear clearly in any
statutory text; (4) it is not a court's right to
extend the waiver of sovereign immunity more
broadly than has been directed by the [the
legislature]; and (5) sovereign immunity is not
to be waived by policy arguments[.]

 In the Circuit Court, in its response to Plaintiffs’ motion for
partial summary judgment, inter alia, the State noted that “the State of
Hawaii has not waived its sovereign immunity to allow Plaintiffs to sue for
damages for violation of HAPA, including attorney’s fees.”

Kaleikini v. Yoshika, __ Hawai' i__, 304 P.3d 252, 2013 WL 1844892 
*10-11 (emphasis and full case citations added; footnotes and 
internal quotation marks omitted). 
In the instant case, Plaintiffs sought declaratory and
 
injunctive relief pursuant to HAPA's judicial review statute, HRS
 
§ 91-7. As discussed below, HRS § 91-7 does not waive the
 
State's sovereign immunity.
 
In Sierra Club II, the Hawai' i Supreme Court concluded 
that the State waived its sovereign immunity pursuant to HRS 
§ 343-7. 120 Hawai' i at 226-28, 202 P.3d at 1271-73. In 
Kaleikini, however, the Hawai' i Supreme Court found that HRS § 
5
6E-13(b) (2009)  was distinguishable from HRS § 343-7 because HRS
§ 6E-13(b) "allows suit to be brought only for a restraining
 order or injunctive relief," and therefore, a waiver of the
 
5
 HRS § 6E-13(b) provides:
 
Any person may maintain an action in the trial court having
jurisdiction where the alleged violation occurred or is likely to
occur for restraining orders or injunctive relief against the
State, its political subdivisions, or any person upon a showing of
irreparable injury, for the protection of an historic property or
a burial site and the public trust therein from unauthorized or
improper demolition, alteration, or transfer of the property or
burial site.

State's sovereign immunity could not be similarly implied.6
 
Kaleikini, at *11. The Kaleikini Court explained:
 
It is well settled that a provision allowing for declaratory
or injunctive relief is not a waiver of the State's sovereign immunity, but rather an exception to the sovereign
immunity doctrine for which no waiver is necessary. [Sierra Club II], 120 Hawai' i at 229 n.30, 202 P.3d at 1274 n.30
("Where a party seeks only injunctive relief, the ability tosue the state does not stem from a waiver of sovereignimmunity, but from the fact that sovereign immunity does notbar the suit in the first place."). Indeed, [Sierra ClubII] expressly recognized the distinction between a claimbrought pursuant to HRS § 343-7 and one seeking onlyinjunctive relief. Id. (noting that the case relied on by
the dissent in [Sierra Club II], Taomae v. Lingle, 110Hawai'i 327, 132 P.3d 1238 (2006), was distinguishable
because it involved a suit for injunctive relief andtherefore involved "no statutory waiver of sovereign
immunity for the underlying action").
 
Id. at *11. Accordingly, the supreme court concluded, "HRS § 6E­
13(b) does not contain a waiver of the State's sovereign
 
immunity." Id. at *12.
 
Similar to Kaleikini, here, Plaintiffs sought
 
declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to HAPA's judicial
 
review statute, HRS § 91-7, which provides:
 
Declaratory judgment on validity of rules. (a) Any interested
person may obtain a judicial declaration as to the validity of an
agency rule as provided in subsection (b) herein by bringing an
action against the agency in the circuit court of the county in
which petitioner resides or has its principal place of business.
The action may be maintained whether or not petitioner has first

 Long before Kaleikini, the Hawai' i Supreme Court recognized the
distinction between the effect of sovereign immunity on actions seekingprospective relief and those seeking retrospective relief, stating: 
If the relief sought against a state official is prospective
in nature, then the relief may be allowed regardless of the
state's sovereign immunity. This is true even though
accompanied by a substantial ancillary effect on the state
treasury. However, relief that is tantamount to an award of
damages for a past violation of law, even though styled as
something else, is barred by sovereign immunity.
 
Pele Def. Fund v. Paty, 73 Haw. 578, 609-10, 837 P.2d 1247, 1266 (1992)(citations, internal quotation marks, footnote, and ellipsis omitted; emphasisadded). Therefore, "[w]here a party seeks only injunctive relief, the ability
to sue the state does not stem from a waiver of sovereign immunity, but from
the fact that sovereign immunity does not bar the suit in the first place."Sierra Club II, 120 Hawai' i at 229 n.30, 202 P.3d at 1274 n.30.

requested the agency to pass upon the validity of the rule in
question.
 
(b) The court shall declare the rule invalid if it finds
 
that it violates constitutional or statutory provisions, or
exceeds the statutory authority of the agency, or was adopted
without compliance with statutory rulemaking procedures.
 
HRS § 91-7 (2012) (emphasis added). According to its plain 
language, HRS § 91-7 allows suit to be brought only for 
declaratory relief, and is therefore distinguishable from HRS 
§ 343-7 and Sierra Club II. Instead, similar to Kaleikini, a 
waiver of the State's sovereign immunity cannot be implied from 
HRS § 91-7. See Kaleikini, at *11 (citing Sierra Club II, 120 
Hawai'i at 229 n.30, 202 P.3d at 1274 n.30) ("It is well settled 
that a provision allowing for declaratory or injunctive relief is 
not a waiver of the State's sovereign immunity, but rather an 
exception to the sovereign immunity doctrine for which no waiver 
is necessary."). Accordingly, HRS § 91-7 does not waive the 
State's sovereign immunity and, thus, the State's immunity bars 
Plaintiffs' request for attorney's fees. 
For these reasons, the Circuit Court's July 27, 2010
 
Order Denying Fees is affirmed.
