STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
STEPHEN P. FORMAN, also known as Brazil, Defendant-Appellant
 
NO. 30681
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0987)
 
SEPTEMBER 8, 2011
 
FUJISE, PRESIDING JUDGE, LEONARD AND GINOZA, JJ.
 
OPINION OF THE COURT BY FUJISE, J.
 
Defendant-Appellant Stephen P. Forman, also known as
 
Brazil (Forman), appeals from the August 11, 2010 judgment of
 
conviction, entered in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit
 
(circuit court).1 A jury found Forman guilty of one count of
 
Unauthorized Control of Propelled Vehicle (UCPV), in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 708-836 (Supp. 2010).
 
Forman raises two points of error: (1) that the
 
circuit court erred by admitting testimony that the company that
 
owned the moped he was riding when stopped by police had no
 
rental contract authorizing Forman to use the moped and (2) that

his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel. We 
conclude that the evidence that the company had no contract with 
Forman is admissible under Rule 803(b)(7) of the Hawaii Rules of 
Evidence (HRE), and that the trial record is insufficient to 
evaluate whether the assistance given by Forman's trial counsel 
was ineffective. Accordingly, we affirm Forman's conviction, 
without prejudice to Forman filing a petition pursuant to Rule 40 
of Hawai' i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP). 
I. Background
 
On June 25, 2009, Honolulu Police Department officers
 
Kenneth Creekmur and Nalei Sooto stopped Forman while he was
 riding a moped on Ala Wai Boulevard. The moped's license decal
 
was partially missing or had been removed, which, according to
 
the officers, was not uncommon for mopeds that had been stolen.
 
Forman identified himself to the officers and told them
 
that he had just rented the moped but did not have the rental
 
paperwork on him. Officer Soto determined that the moped was
 
registered to Adventure on 2 Wheels and that the moped was
 
missing, but the company had not reported it as stolen. Forman
 
was arrested and charged by felony information with UCPV.
 
At trial, Kim Voight, the owner/president of Adventure
 
on 2 Wheels, Inc. (Adventure), verified that the company was the
 
registered owner of a blue moped with license number N60317 and
 
that the company referred to it as Moped No. 26.
 
According to Voight, Adventure's procedure for
 
renting a moped required employees to ask the customer for a
 
driver's license and verify that the customer is eighteen. 
Customers must provide a credit card number for a deposit in case
 
the moped becomes damaged, but can pay rental fees by cash or
 
credit card. A company employee informs the customer of the
 
rental fees and shows the customer a contract. Each contract has
 
been pre-printed with a number. The employee writes the number
 
of the moped being rented on the contract, records any pre­
2
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
existing damage and the mileage, and the customer signs it. 
According to Voight, no one would be allowed to use a moped
 
without signing a contract.
 
Voight stated that the contracts are generated every
 
time the company rents a moped and the records are kept in the
 
regular course of business. The contracts are "locked up" after
 
customers sign them and "dropped in a safe" once the mopeds are
 
returned. After Forman's arrest, Voight attempted to locate an
 
agreement "for a Moped No. 26 on or about June 25th, 2009," but
 
could not find one. Voight reviewed the contracts "from that
 
time period," and no contracts were missing from the sequence.
 
The prosecutor asked Voight, "So based on the absence
 
of these contracts, can you tell if anyone had permission to
 
operate the blue moped with license N60317, which for your -­
according to your company is Moped No. 26?" Forman objected: 
"Calls for speculation, foundation, hearsay, lack of personal
 
knowledge, competency." The circuit court overruled the
 
objection. Voight answered that "[n]o one has permission. Not
 
even my employees can ride the mopeds."
 
Forman was the sole witness for the defense. He
 
claimed that he was operating the moped under apparent
 
authorization given to him by Alfredo Bandalan (Bandalan), a
 
company employee. According to Forman, on June 21, 2009, he went
 
to the hostel where Adventure is located and Adam Weiss, a friend
 
of Forman's girlfriend, introduced him to Bandalan. Forman
 
testified that Bandalan rented him the moped for $40 a day, and
 
he returned to the hostel four or five times to pay Bandalan,
 
each time in cash. Forman also said that Bandalan gave him some
 
paperwork, which he discarded without reading.
 
Voight verified that in June 2009 Bandalan was an
 
employee of the company. She said Bandalan worked for the
 
company for about two months before she fired him because "he
 
kept bad paperwork" and was late. Prior to terminating Bandalan,
 
Voight warned him "that he needed to keep his paperwork better"
 
but his performance "[g]ot worse."

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Bandalan did not testify. The State named him on its 
witness list filed January 5, 2010. A week later, on the first 
day of trial, the court was informed that the State would not 
call Bandalan to testify; he was not in Hawai' i because he had 
been extradited to Kentucky a month earlier to stand trial on a rape charge. In response to Forman's concerns that Bandalan's 
2
absence might raise a "confrontation clause problem,"  the
parties stipulated that they would make no reference to what
 
Bandalan said to police.
 
On January 15, 2010, a jury found Forman guilty on one
 
count of UCPV.
 
On February 1, 2010, Forman's counsel (Counsel) filed a
 
motion to withdraw, based on Forman's belief that Counsel was
 
providing ineffective assistance. 
At the hearing on the motion,
 
Forman said that before trial, he had located Bandalan and
 Bandalan agreed to testify on his behalf, that he told Counsel to
 
subpoena Bandalan, but that Counsel refused, because "that's
 
against my strategy." The circuit court asked Counsel for a
 
response, to which Counsel replied, "I think he has arguments to
 
be made. I think they should be made in a formal setting. I
 
don't think this would be the appropriate setting for that." The
 
circuit court granted the motion to withdraw as counsel.
 
On March 9, 2010, Forman, represented by newly-
appointed counsel Walter Rodby, filed a motion for new trial on
 
the grounds that Counsel provided ineffective assistance where he
 
"failed to investigate, interview and subpoena a critical defense
 
witness, Alfredo Bandalan, which resulted in the substantial
 
impairment of a meritorious defense," and where he had a conflict
 
of interest because the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) had
 
simultaneously represented Bandalan and Forman. Forman
 
acknowledged that the motion was made after HRPP Rule 33's ten-
day deadline but argued the deadline should not be rigidly

 The Sixth Amendment of the federal Constitution provides that "the
accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses
against him[.]" U.S. Const. Amend. VI. See also Haw. Const. art. 1, § 14.

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
applied out of fairness. The State argued that the deadline must
 
be strictly complied with, and Forman's motion should be denied
 
because it was filed 53 days after the jury verdict, or 43 days
 
late.
 
At the hearing on the motion for new trial, Forman
 
introduced:
 
•	 An offer of proof that Adam Weiss "would also be able
to corroborate that Mr. Forman was making rental
payments on that moped to [] Bandalan" and that Weiss
never talked to a public defender;
 
•	 An audio recording of a conversation between Rodby and
Bandalan in which Bandalan said that he "rented the
 moped without documentation, and in fear of losing
[his] job, [he] made false statements to the police"
and that he never talked to an attorney representing
"Brazil";
 
•	 Forman's testimony that he found Bandalan and that
Bandalan agreed to make a statement to the effect that
Forman was not aware that the moped was stolen; that he
asked Counsel to talk to Bandalan but Counsel said "oh,
it's against my strategy," and to his knowledge Counsel
never talked to Bandalan;
 
•	 A note from Forman to Counsel, made during trial, which
read, "You need to let the jury know I requested Mr.
Bandalan & Adam to be subpoenaed but it went against
your strategy."
 
Forman also orally moved to dismiss the charges because he
 
received ineffective assistance of counsel. The circuit court
 
denied the motion for new trial as untimely and denied the motion
 
to dismiss.
 
After the hearing, the defense filed a sworn
 
declaration from Bandalan, in which he asserted that he rented
 
the moped to Forman, Forman paid Bandalan but Bandalan used the
 
money for his own benefit, and that Bandalan did not tell Forman
 
that he was using the rental fees for his own benefit. He also
 
attested that Forman's attorney did not contact him about
 
appearing in court.

The circuit court sentenced Forman to imprisonment for
 
five years, subject to a mandatory minimum of one year and eight
 
months as a repeat offender.
 
II. Discussion
 
A. Admissibility of the Absence of a Business Record
 
Forman's first point of error alleges that the circuit
 
court erred by admitting Voight's testimony that there was no
 rental contract for Moped No. 26. Although Forman gave a
 
scattershot objection at trial that the testimony should be
 
excluded based on "speculation, foundation, hearsay and lack of
 
personal knowledge, and competency," on appeal he only argues
 
that "the source of the information and other circumstantial
 
evidence indicate[s] a lack of trustworthiness." We conclude
 
that the circuit court did not err in admitting Voight's
 
testimony under HRE Rule 803(b)(7).
 
"Where admissibility of evidence is determined by 
application of the hearsay rule, there can only be one correct 
result, and the appropriate standard for appellate review is the 
right/wrong standard." State v. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i 354, 362, 
227 P.3d 520, 528 (2010) (quoting State v. Machado, 109 Hawai' i 
445, 450, 127 P.3d 941, 946 (2006) (internal quotation marks 
omitted)). However, whether proposed evidence shows a "lack of 
trustworthiness" is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Id. 
(citing State v. Jhun, 83 Hawai' i 472, 477 & n.4, 927 P.2d 1355, 
1360 & n.4 (1996)). 
HRE Rule 803(b)(7) permits the admission of:
 
[e]vidence that a matter is not included in the memoranda,
reports, records, or data compilations, in any form, kept in
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (6), to prove
the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of the matter, if the
matter was of a kind of which a memorandum, report, record,
or data compilation was regularly made and preserved, unless
the sources of information or other circumstances indicate
 lack of trustworthiness.
 
Paragraph (6) provides for the admission of "records of regularly
 
conducted activity," which may include:
 
6
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
[a] memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any
form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses,
made in the course of a regularly conducted activity, at or
near the time of the acts, events, conditions, opinions, or
diagnoses, as shown by the testimony of the custodian or
other qualified witness, or by certification that complies
with rule 902(11) or a statute permitting certification,
unless the sources of information or other circumstances
 indicate lack of trustworthiness.
 
HRE 803(b)(6).
 
The absence of an entry in a business record is
 
technically not hearsay because it "is not, in and of itself, a
 
'statement . . . offered in evidence to prove the truth of the
 
matter asserted[].'" HRE Rule 803(b)(6) and (7) cmt. Rule
 
803(b)(7) nevertheless classifies the absent business record as a
 
hearsay exception. Id. Accord Fed. R. Evid. 803(7) advisory
 
committee's note; United States v. Lee, 589 F.2d 980, 987 (9th
 Cir. 1979).
 
Although the Hawai' i Supreme Court has discussed the 
foundational sufficiency of business records under HRE 803(b)(6), 
see, e.g., Fitzwater, no prior Hawai' i appellate case has 
examined the foundation needed to introduce evidence that a business record did not exist under HRE 803(b)(7). Because HRE 
Rule 803(b)(6) and (7) are based on Rules 803(6) and (7) of the 
Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), we look to cases applying the 
federal rule for guidance. HRE 803(b)(6) and (7) cmt.; 
see State v. Fukagawa, 100 Hawai'i 498, 511 n.9, 60 P.3d 899, 912 
n.9 (2002) (looking to authorities construing FRE Rules 702 and
 
703 "because the HRE are patterned after those rules").
 
Some federal cases suggest that the foundational
 
prerequisites for admitting evidence under FRE Rule 803(7) are
 
the same as those for admitting business records under Rule
 
803(6). See United States v. Regner, 677 F.2d 754, 762 (9th Cir.
 
1982) ("since [FRE] 803(7) is based on 803(6), such testimony
 [regarding the nature of recordkeeping] is required before
 
evidence may be received thereunder"); In re Apex Express Corp.,
 
190 F.3d 624, 635 (4th Cir. 1999); Morris v. B.C. Olympiakos,
 
SFP, 721 F. Supp. 2d 546, 551 (S.D. Tex. 2010); In re Enron
 
7
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Creditors Recovery Corp., 376 B.R. 442, 454 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.
 
2007).
 
Other federal cases suggest, however, that the
 
foundation for a business record is inadequate for admitting
 
absence of the same record. The First Circuit Court of Appeals,
 
for example, concluded that the slight variation between the
 
language in FRE 803(6) and 803(7) "indicates that even if a
 
business record is deemed sufficiently trustworthy to be
 
admissible for its contents under Rule 803(6), other
 
circumstances might render omissions in that record untrustworthy
 
to show that the events omitted did not occur." United States v.
 
Muñoz-Franco, 487 F.3d 25, 39 (1st Cir. 2007). The Court of
 Federal Claims emphasized that "when a litigant offers the
 
absence of a business record as proof that an event did not take
 
place, under Rule 803(7), the trustworthiness requirement assumes
 
heightened importance . . . ." Exxon Corp. v. United States, 45
 
Fed. Cl. 581, 690 (1999), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other
 grounds by Exxon Mobil Corp. v. United States, 244 F.3d 1341
 
(Fed. Cir. 2001).
 
The federal courts have cited three concerns when
 
evaluating the trustworthiness of absent records, including both
 
public and business records. First, where a qualifying witness
3
 
testifies to the purported absence of a record, the
 trustworthiness of this testimony depends on "the thoroughness or
 
diligence of the records search." United States v. Robinson, 544
 
F.2d 110, 115 (2nd Cir. 1976). Second, there must be a showing
 that the record searched was itself sufficiently complete. Exxon
 
Corp., 45 Fed. Cl. at 691. Lastly, if the record is being used
 to prove that an event did not occur, the event must be of the
 
3
 The Ninth Circuit noted that although FRE Rule 803(7) does not
specifically require testimony of a custodian or another qualified witness, it
assumed, without deciding, that their testimony would be necessary to overcome
a challenge to the trustworthiness of the records. United States v. Rich, 580
 
F.2d 929, 938 (9th Cir. 1978).
 
8
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
particular type that would have been mentioned in the record if
 
it had indeed occurred. See United States v. De Georgia, 420
 
F.2d 889, 893 (9th Cir. 1969).
 
Unlike FRE Rule 803(10) and HRE Rule 803(b)(10), which
 
concern the absence of entries in a public record, FRE Rule
 803(7) and HRE Rule 803(b)(7) do not require certification or
 
testimony that "diligent search failed to disclose the record,
 
report, statement, or data compilation." However, this is
 
implied. See 30B Michael H. Graham, Federal Practice and
 
Procedure § 7048, at 590 (Interim ed. 2006). "It hardly requires
 extended discussion to demonstrate that a casual or partial
 
search cannot justify the conclusion that there was no record." 
Robinson, 544 F.2d at 115.
 
Courts have rejected the use of FRE Rule 803(7) to
 
prove the non-occurrence of an event where the records, which
 
should have documented the event, although completely searched,
 
were partial or incomplete. For example, in Exxon Corp., the
 
Court of Federal Claims rejected Exxon's contention that,
 
pursuant to FRE Rule 803(7), it was entitled to a "negative
 
evidence" inference that an event did not occur because contract
 
files stipulated into the record did not mention an event in
 
dispute, because the court had "no assurance whatever that [the
 
contract files] are complete" and, to the contrary, found
 
"chronological gaps" and "other indicia of incompleteness." 45
 
Fed. Cl. at 691. Although the parties stipulated to admit the
 
files, they did not stipulate "as to the manner of [their]
 
origin, purpose, or completeness." Id. The court reasoned that
 
lack of a relevant document within the files could mean that the
 document was never executed or that it "existed at one time, but
 
was subsequently lost, destroyed, misfiled, or otherwise excluded
 
from the contract file." Id. The Court of Appeals for Veterans
 
9
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER

Claims noted that before making inferences from "negative
evidence," the records must "appear to be complete, at least in
 
relevant part." Kahana v. Shinseki
, 24 Vet. App. 428, 440 (2011)
 
(Lance, J., concurring). If records are complete, the claims
 review board must also find that the "injury, disease, or related
 
symptoms would ordinarily have been recorded had they occurred." 
Id. Without the assurance that records are complete, the court
 
said, "then silence in the [medical records] is merely the
 absence of evidence and not substantive negative evidence." Id.
 
A showing that the unrecorded event would ordinarily
 
have been recorded in the course of business had it occurred
 
finds its corollary in the requirement in FRE Rule 803(6) that a
 
record is "kept in the course of a regularly conducted business
 
activity." See De Georgia, 420 F.2d at 891-92 (citing 5 Wigmore,
 
Evidence §§ 1531, 1556 at 392, 410 (3d ed. 1940)). "If records
 are routinely kept (or entries are routinely made), they are
 
likely to be complete and comprehensive, so nonmention (or
 
nonexistence of a record or entry) is a good indication that act,
 
event, or condition did not occur or exist." Exxon, 45 Fed. Cl.
 
at 690-91 (quoting Christopher B. Mueller & Laird C. Kirkpatrick,
 Evidence § 8.51, at 995 (1995)). "Demonstrating that the records
 
were kept in such a way that the matter would have been recorded
 
had it occurred is crucial to any such showing." 5-803
 
Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 803.09 (2002). "[I]f a business
 
record designed to note every transaction of a particular kind
 
contains no notation of such a transaction between specified
 
dates, no such transaction occurred between those dates." De
 
Georgia, 420 F.2d at 893 (emphasis added) (applying the
 predecessor statute to FRE Rule 803(7) to admit testimony
 
regarding lack of rental-car contract as proof of interstate
 
4
 Although they are not bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence, FRE
Rule 1101(a), the veterans' claims courts frequently cite FRE Rule 803(7) to
admit "negative evidence" based on omissions from medical records, e.g., a
finding that a disability does not exist because a medical record, as a
particular type of business record, does not mention signs or symptoms of that
disability.
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
transportation of stolen vehicles). However, if the records do
 
not record every transaction of a particular kind, it casts doubt
 
on the regularity of such a record and thus whether the records
 
can be relied upon as being complete. See Fury Imports, Inc. v.
 
Shakespeare Co., 554 F.2d 1376, 1381 (5th Cir. 1977) (reversing
 trial court's use of FRE Rule 803(7) to grant a judgment
 
notwithstanding the verdict in contract dispute where testimony
 
established some transactions were not written down).
 
Here, Forman does not complain that Voight's search of
 
records was not diligent, although her testimony is imprecise as
 
to what records she searched before concluding that there was no
 
rental contract for the moped Forman was caught riding. It is
 
unclear whether Voight searched all rental contracts or the
 
contracts made prior to June 25 but still in effect. Forman's
 
argument on appeal does not rest on the diligence of Voight's
 
search through the company files.
 
Instead, Forman implies that the company's records were
 
too incomplete to be considered trustworthy because Bandalan did
 
not maintain the documents on every rental. However, there was
 
no evidence produced at trial that would support the inference
 
that Bandalan caused the company's records to be incomplete. 
Forman's cross-examination of Voight did not adduce evidence that
 
Bandalan's mishandling of business records included a failure to
 
make required records. Rather, her testimony that Bandalan "kept
 
bad paperwork" is an ambiguous complaint that could encompass a
 
variety of errors, such as writing illegibly, erroneously
 
transcribing customers' information, or misfiling papers. There
 
is no indication that Bandalan's poor work affected the
 
completeness of the company's records.
 
To the contrary, the evidence supports a conclusion
 
that Adventure on Two Wheels's records were complete. Voight
 
testified that the records were printed with sequential numbers,
 
the contracts dated near the time that Forman was apprehended
 
were in sequential order and all accounted for, but there was no
 
contract pertaining to Moped No. 26. Moreover, Voight testified
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
that her employees write a contract for every rental and that the
 
mopeds could not be used without a contract.
 
The vague testimony that Bandalan "kept bad paperwork,"
 
without more, does not warrant a conclusion that the company's
 
records as a whole were untrustworthy. "The mere fact that
 
errors or deviations have occurred from time to time does not
 
destroy the inference of underlying trustworthiness which a judge
 
may choose to draw from proof of a general practice." United
 
States v. McGill, 953 F.2d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing United
 States v. Patterson, 644 F.2d 890, 901 (1st Cir. 1981) ("The fact
 
that a regular practice is occasionally broken is not enough to
 
avoid application of the business records rule; otherwise, the
 
rule would be swallowed up by an exception for less-than-perfect
 
business practices.")). Courts have admitted evidence under the
 
business records rule despite the fact that some records were
 
missing or unavailable, United States v. Hathaway, 798 F.2d 902,
 
907 (6th Cir. 1986), and even manipulated or falsified. United
 
States v. Hutson, 821 F.2d 1015, 1020 (5th Cir. 1987). 
"Generally, objections that an exhibit may contain
 
inaccuracies, ambiguities, or omissions go to the weight and not
 the admissibility of the evidence." United States v. Keplinger,
 
776 F.2d 678, 694 (7th Cir. 1985). See also Hathaway, 798 F.2d
 
at 907 ("in the absence of specific and credible evidence of
 
untrustworthiness, the proper approach is to admit the evidence
 
and permit the jury to determine the weight to be given the
 
records"); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Gladstone, 895 F. Supp. 356,
 
373 (D. Mass. 1995) (noting that although proponent of business
 
record's admission should have handled files more carefully, any
 
inconsistencies bear on the weight to be given); Wallace by
 
Wallace v. Target Stores, Inc., 701 P.2d 1272, 1273 (Colo. App.
 
1985) ("Any incompleteness of the business entries, the business
 
records, or the summaries or compilations thereof, goes to the
 
weight of the evidence, and not to its admissibility."). Accord
 
State v. Bush, 58 Haw. 340, 344, 569 P.2d. 349, 351 (1997) ("a
 jury is asked to weigh the chances that the [circumstantial]
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
evidence correctly points to guilt against the possibility of
 
inaccuracy or ambiguous inference").
 
The circuit court's determination of whether there is a 
lack of trustworthiness of evidence offered under HRE Rule 803 is 
reviewed for abuse of discretion. Fitzwater, 122 Hawai' i at 363, 
227 P.3d at 529 (citing Jhun, 83 Hawai' i at 478 & n.4, 927 P.2d 
at 1361 & n.4). Here, the circuit court apparently determined 
that Adventure's records bore the indicia of trustworthiness. 
Forman's sole basis for maintaining the records were not 
trustworthy was Bandalan's "bad paperwork." However, this 
ambiguous testimony is insufficient to establish the circuit 
court's conclusion to the contrary "clearly exceeded the bounds 
of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice 
to the substantial detriment of a party litigant." State v. 
Crisostomo, 94 Hawai' i 282, 287, 12 P.3d 873, 878 (2000). 
Accordingly, we conclude the circuit court did not abuse its 
discretion in determining that Voight's testimony regarding the 
lack of a rental contract was admissible under HRE Rule 
803(b)(7). 
B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
 
Forman's second point of error on appeal reiterated the 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim made in his untimely 
motion for new trial. Because Forman did not move for a new 
trial before HRPP Rule 33's deadline, the circuit court lacked 
jurisdiction to hear his ineffective assistance claim. State v. 
Reed, 77 Hawai' i 72, 83, 881 P.2d 1218, 1229 (1994), overruled on 
other grounds by State v. Balanza, 93 Hawai' i 279, 1 P.3d 281 
(2000). Where the circuit court lacks jurisdiction to hear an ineffective assistance claim, the appellate courts consider it as 
raised for the first time on appeal. Id. at 83, 881 P.3d at 
1229. Such a claim may be raised for the first time on appeal. Id. (citing State v. Silva, 75 Haw. 419, 864 P.2d 583 (1993)). 
In analyzing an ineffective assistance of counsel
 
claim, the appellate courts consider whether counsel acted
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
"within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal 
cases." State v. Wakisaka, 102 Hawai' i 504, 513-14, 78 P.3d 317, 
326-27 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
"The defendant has the burden of establishing ineffective
assistance of counsel and must meet the following two-parttest: 1) that there were specific errors or omissionsreflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, or diligence;and 2) that such errors or omissions resulted in either thewithdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentiallymeritorious defense."[] State v. Aplaca, 74 Haw. 54, 66-67,
837 P.2d 1298, 1305 (1992). To satisfy this second prong,the defendant needs to show a possible impairment, ratherthan a probable impairment, of a potentially meritoriousdefense. State v. Christian, 88 Hawai' i 407, 419, 967 P.2d
239, 251 (1998). A defendant need not prove actualprejudice. Id. 
Id. at 514, 78 P.3d at 327. Forman points to Counsel's failure 
to obtain Bandalan's testimony for trial as a specific omission 
demonstrating his ineffectiveness. Where an ineffective 
assistance claim is based on counsel's failure to obtain a 
witness, the defendant must produce affidavits or sworn 
statements describing the testimony of the proffered witnesses. 
State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 19, 39, 960 P.2d 1227, 1247 (1998). 
Here, Forman produced such a declaration from Bandalan. 
Forman's trial communication with Counsel suggests that
 
the failure to call Bandalan was a strategic decision. Counsel
 stipulated at trial to exclude any statements made by Bandalan;
 
Bandalan's initial statement to police led to Forman's arrest. 
Generally, the appellate courts will not subject alleged errors
 
which have "an obvious tactical basis for benefitting the
 
defendant's case" to further scrutiny. Briones v. State, 74 Haw.
 
442, 462-63, 848 P.2d 966, 976 (1993). Moreover, "[t]he decision
 
whether to call witnesses in a criminal trial is normally a
 
matter within the judgment of counsel and, accordingly, will
 
rarely be second-guessed by judicial hindsight." State v.
 
Onishi, 64 Haw. 62, 63, 636 P.2d 742, 744 (1981). On the other
 hand, the court should not defer to counsel's judgment in
 
deciding not to call a potential witness to testify where there
 
was not "a foundational factual predicate" from which counsel
 
14
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
could make an informed decision about whether to call the
 
witness. Aplaca, 74 Haw. at 71, 837 P.2d at 1307.
 
In Aplaca, the Hawai' i Supreme Court held, "the 
decision not to conduct a pretrial investigation of prospective defense witnesses cannot be classified as a tactical decision or 
trial strategy." Id. Aplaca's trial counsel conceded that he 
did not attempt to interview witnesses who would have bolstered Aplaca's credibility and oppugned the complaining witness's 
credibility, or investigate leads that were mentioned in 
subpoenaed documents. Id. at 70, 837 P.2d at 1306-07. The Court 
said, 
If counsel does not adequately investigate the underlying
facts of a case, including the availability of prospective
defense witnesses, counsel's performance cannot fall within
the "wide range of reasonable professional assistance."
 . . . It is only after an adequate inquiry has been made
that counsel can make a reasonable decision to call or not
 to call particular witnesses for tactical reasons.
 
Id. (quoting State v. Templin, 805 P.2d 182, 188 (Utah 1990)). 
Accordingly, the Court remanded the case for a new trial on the
 
basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. at 73, 837 P.2d
 
at 1308.
 
If not for Bandalan's assertion that Forman's public
 
defender did not contact him before trial, we would conclude that
 
the failure to call Bandalan resulted from a tactical decision
 
and deny Forman's ineffective assistance claim accordingly. 
However, like the corroborating witnesses who were never called
 
in Aplaca, Bandalan attested that Counsel never contacted him. 
See id. at 68, 837 P.2d at 1306. This suggests that Counsel did
 
not diligently investigate Forman's apparent-authority defense. 
In contrast to Aplaca's trial counsel, however, Counsel made no
 
statement regarding what attempts he made, if any, to interview
 
Bandalan.
 
Defense counsel's failure to call a corroborating
 
witness may result in the substantial impairment of a potentially
 
meritorious defense. Silva, 75 Haw. at 443, 864 P.2d at 594. 
However, where the Supreme Court was unable to determine from the 
15
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
record whether the defense counsel attempted to subpoena the
 
witness, the court would not conclude from the fact that the
 
witness was actually not subpoenaed that there was an omission
 
reflecting counsel's lack of skill, judgment, and diligence
 
rising to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. Id. at
 
443-44, 864 P.2d at 594-95. The court implied that the extent of
 defense counsel's attempts to obtain a witness's presence by
 
subpoena might refute a showing of ineffective assistance. Id. 
The court acknowledged that "not every trial record is 
sufficiently developed to determine whether there has been 
ineffective assistance of counsel[.]" Id., at 439, 864 P.2d at 
592; see also Reed, 77 Hawai' i at 83, 881 P.2d at 1229. 
[W]here the record on appeal is insufficient to demonstrate
ineffective assistance of counsel, but where: (1) the
defendant alleges facts that if proven would entitle him or
her to relief, and (2) the claim is not patently frivolous
and without trace of support in the record,[] the appellate
court may affirm defendant's conviction without prejudice to
a subsequent [HRPP] Rule 40 petition on the ineffective
assistance of counsel claim.
 
Silva, 75 Haw. at 439, 864 P.2d at 592-93. Such is the case
 
here. 
Forman raises a prima facie claim of ineffective
 
assistance. Because Forman was the sole witness in his defense,
 
the jury might have found his testimony self-serving and not
 
credible. Bandalan's testimony, if believed, would have
 
corroborated Forman's testimony and supported his defense that he
 
had the apparent authorization to use the moped. Thus, the
 
failure to obtain Bandalan's testimony impaired this potentially
 
meritorious defense. Bandalan's declaration that Counsel did not
 
talk to him before trial, however, is insufficient evidence from
 
which to conclude that Counsel was not diligent in investigating
 
Forman's apparent-authorization defense. Thus, we affirm
 
defendant's conviction without prejudice to a subsequent petition
 
brought under HRPP Rule 40. We note that where ineffectiveness
 
of counsel is the basis for a Rule 40 petition, the defendant
 
must serve written notice of the hearing on counsel whose
 
16
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
assistance has been challenged as ineffective and the counsel
 
shall be given an opportunity to be heard. See HRPP Rule 40(f).
 
Forman's second ineffective assistance claim alleges
 
that a conflict of interest was created when two attorneys from
 
the OPD simultaneously represented him and Bandalan--Counsel
 
represented Forman at his January 2010 trial and Alan Komogome
 
represented Bandalan at an extradition hearing in November 2009-­
and that Forman did not waive such a conflict. 
In considering whether a conflict of interest 
constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel, the appellate 
court considers first "whether a relationship existed between the 
attorney and his/her clients giving rise to a conflict." Richie, 
88 Hawai' i at 44, 960 P.2d at 1252. The Hawai' i Rules of 
Professional Conduct (HRPC) indicate that a conflict may arise 
where a lawyer represents two clients whose interests are 
"directly adverse" or whose representation may be "materially 
limited" by the attorney's responsibilities to the other. HRPC 
Rule 1.7 (a) and (b)." Forman has shown neither. State v. Mark, 
123 Hawai' i 205, 245-46, 231 P.3d 478, 518-19 (2010). Therefore, 
our analysis returns to whether an actual conflict existed, and 
we will assume, as Forman has, that the OPD is a single firm. 
Under HRPC Rule 1.7,
 (
a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the
representation of that client will be directly adverse to
another client, unless:
 
(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation
will not adversely affect the relationship with the
other client; and
 
(2) each client consents after consultation.
 
(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the
representation of that client may be materially limited by
the lawyer's responsibilities to another client or to a
third person, or by the lawyer's own interests, unless:
 
(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation
will not be adversely affected; and
 
17
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
(2) the client consents after consultation. When
 
representation of multiple clients in a single matter
is undertaken, the consultation shall include
explanation of the implications of the common
representation and the advantages and risks involved.
 
HRPC Rule 1.7. The Hawai' i Supreme Court has said that 
"paragraph (a) encompasses the situation in which defense counsel 
represents, in another case, a person who is a prosecution 
witness in the current case," because "[w]hen the attorney cross-
examines that client on the witness stand, he is clearly acting 
'directly adverse' to that client." Richie, 88 Hawai' i at 44, 
960 P.2d at 1252. However, the court has also noted that "although a 'relationship giving rise to a conflict' may exist at 
a certain point in time, i.e., prior to trial, if that 
relationship ceases prior to the development of an actual 
conflict, then counsel is not necessarily ineffective, depending 
on the 'particular circumstances of the [ ] case[.]'" Mark, 123 
Hawai'i at 239-40, 231 P.3d at 512-13 (quoting Richie, 88 Hawai' i 
at 44, 960 P.2d at 1252). 
In Richie, the alleged conflict of interest arose when 
one of Richie's defense attorneys represented Monica Alves, "an 
obvious potential witness" and one-time co-defendant, in a 
separate civil case. 88 Hawai' i at 44, 960 P.2d at 1252. The 
Supreme Court chastised counsel's decision to represent both Richie and Alves as "at the very least, unwise" but noted that 
the co-representation did not support an ineffectiveness 
complaint because by the time Richie went to trial, the State had 
dismissed charges against Alves, so she was no longer a 
co-defendant. Id. Furthermore, Alves was never called as a 
witness. Id. "Although she was clearly a potential witness, she 
was not an actual witness." Id. As the court later explained, 
"under the particular circumstances of that case, no conflict materialized." Mark, 123 Hawai' i at 240, 231 P.3d 478, 513. 
Analogously here, the conflict that would be created if
 
the public defender cross-examined Bandalan did not materialize
 
because Bandalan did not testify. When Bandalan was represented
 
18
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
by a public defender at his extradition hearing, Bandalan was
 
only a potential witness in Forman's trial. It was not until
 
January 5, 2010, a week before trial and after Bandalan had been
 
extradited, that the State named Bandalan on its witness list. 
Therefore, there was no overlap in the time in which OPD
 
represented Forman and Bandalan was an actual witness for the
 
State.
 
Forman's appeal asserts that Bandalan should have been 
the defense's witness, not the prosecution's. Although it is 
clear, under Hawai' i law, that a conflict is inherent in "joint 
representation of two or more co-defendants and concurrent representation of both the defendant and . . . a prosecution 
witness," Richie, 88 Hawai' i at 44, 960 P.2d at 1252, we can find 
no authority, nor does Forman cite any, that a conflict is presumed where a defense attorney represents, in an unrelated 
criminal matter, a witness on his or her client's behalf. See 
State v. Wabashaw, 740 N.W.2d 583, 597 (Neb. 2007) (concern that defense counsel is unable "to conduct a thorough 
cross-examination" due to loyalty owed to witness-client is not 
present on direct examination); see also Gregory G. Sarno, 
Annotation, Circumstances giving rise to prejudicial conflict of 
interests between criminal defendant and defense counsel—state 
cases, 18 A.L.R.4th 360 (1982) (collecting cases with divergent 
views on whether "[r]epresentation by same or affiliated 
attorneys of noncodefendant defense witnesses at separate 
proceedings" constitutes a conflict of interest); 
OPD represented Bandalan and Forman simultaneously for
 
a brief period, during Bandalan's extradition proceedings. 
Forman failed to show that at the time of the concurrent
 
representation that Forman's interests conflicted with Bandalan's
 
interests, whatever they were during the extradition. The
 
defendant has the burden of demonstrating that his or her
 
attorney actively represented conflicting interests. See Fragiao
 
v. State, 95 Hawai' i 9, 17, 18 P.3d 871, 879 (2001). Forman 
failed to demonstrate that a conflict of interest existed. 
19
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Consequently, we do not consider whether the OPD's relationships 
with Bandalan and Forman caused Counsel to provide ineffective 
assistance. See Mark, 123 Hawai' i at 243, 231 P.3d at 516. 
The burden of showing ineffective assistance of counsel 
rests on Forman. Briones, 74 Haw. at 460, 848 P.2d at 975. 
Forman failed to demonstrate that a conflict of interest existed because of the OPD's representation. Consequently, we do not 
consider whether such a relationship constituted ineffective 
assistance of counsel. See Mark, 123 Hawai' i at 243, 231 P.3d at 
516.
 
III. Conclusion
 
We affirm defendant's conviction without prejudice to a
 
motion for relief under HRPP Rule 40.
