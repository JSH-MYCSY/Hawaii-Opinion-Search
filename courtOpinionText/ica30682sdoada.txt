NO. 30682
 
IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI» I 
STATE OF HAWAI» I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
STEVE C. CABAGBAG, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CRIMINAL NO. 10-1-0240)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Steve C. Cabagbag, Jr. ("Cabagbag")
 
appeals from the Judgment of Conviction and Probation Sentence
 
filed on July 19, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit1
 
("Circuit Court"). Cabagbag was convicted by a jury of
 Unauthorized Control of a Propelled Vehicle in violation of
 Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") ÿÿ 708-836 (Supp. 2010) and Theft
 
in the Second Degree in violation of HRS ÿÿ 708-831 (Supp. 2010). 
Cabagbag was sentenced to probation for two concurrent terms of
 
five years and imprisonment for a term of nine months, plus
 various fees. 
On appeal, Cabagbag identifies a single point of error. 
Specifically, Cabagbag contends that the Circuit Court committed
 
plain error by failing to provide a special jury instruction
 regarding eyewitness identification. In addition, Cabagbag
 argues that a "cautionary jury instruction" regarding eyewitness
 identification "should be required" in any case in which
 eyewitness identification is a critical issue.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to

the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that Cabagbag's appeal is without merit. The opening statement by defense counsel, the cross-examination of Officer Tomimbang, defense counsel's closing argument, and the general instructions given by the Circuit Court adequately directed the attention of the jury to the identification evidence. See State v. Vinge, 81 
Hawai» i 309, 316, 916 P.2d 1210, 1217 (1996) ("The giving of 
special instructions on identification has been regarded as within the discretion of the trial judge or superfluous in the light of adequate general instructions." (internal quotation marks omitted)). See also State v. Okumura, 78 Hawai» i 383, 404­
05, 894 P.2d 80, 101-02 (1995); State v. Pahio, 58 Haw. 323, 331, 
568 P.2d 1200, 1206 (1977); State v. Padilla, 57 Haw. 150, 162, 
552 P.2d 357, 365 (1976).

Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment of Conviction
 
and Probation Sentence filed on July 19, 2010 is affirmed.

 Cabagbag recognizes that "an intermediate court of appeals will
not (and cannot) overrule a supreme court decision" and explains that "he
principally raises the issue herein to preserve it for later supreme court
review."
