On cross-appeal, Rosete contends the circuit court
 
erred
 
(1) by admitting evidence of the Government
 
Defendants' prior and subsequent bad acts;
 
(2) by admitting deposition testimony of an OYS
 
employee stemming from an unrelated case when Rosete had no
 
representation at the employee's deposition;
 
(3) by failing to recognize that the proper grounds
 
for granting a new trial was the fundamental unfairness of the
 
first trial; and
 
(4) by failing to recognize that a new trial was 
necessary because Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 662-10 (1993) 
precludes judgment against the State of Hawai' i and Rosete, in 
his individual capacity. 
On cross-appeal, Government Defendants contend the
 
circuit court erred
 
(1) by denying Government Defendants' January 17, 2008
 
Motion to Dismiss Complaint when Costales' claims were barred by
 the statute of limitations pursuant to HRS § 662-4 (1993);
 
(2) by denying Ando's and Yoshimoto's July 28, 2009
 
Motion for Summary Judgment;
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(3) by admitting evidence of other lawsuits that
 
involved Government Defendants; and 
(4) by admitting portions of the Department of 
Justice's (DOJ) August 4, 2005 report of its investigation of the 
Hawai'i Youth Correctional Facility (HYCF). 
I. BACKGROUND
 
This appeal arises from Costales' claim of being 
repeatedly sexually assaulted in January and February 2002 by 
Rosete while Costales was a minor and incarcerated at HYCF as a 
custodial ward of the State of Hawai' i. At the time of the 
alleged sexual assaults, Rosete was under the supervision of HYCF Correction Supervisor Yoshimoto and HYCF Administrator Ando. The 
State of Hawai' i and its agencies, DHS and OYS (collectively, the 
State) were responsible for the operation, management, and administration of HYCF. 
On December 13, 2007, Costales filed her complaint,
 
asserting claims for assault and battery, negligence, intentional
 
and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and punitive
 
damages.
 
On February 14, 2008, the circuit court denied
 
Government Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. On October 7, 2009,
 
the circuit court denied Ando's and Yoshimoto's Motion for
 
Summary Judgment, in which they had argued they were entitled to
 
qualified immunity.
 
Before the start of trial, Government Defendants
 
submitted several motions in limine, including (1) a motion to
 
preclude the introduction of evidence regarding the DOJ
 
investigation of HYCF and (2) a motion to preclude the
 
introduction of evidence regarding other lawsuits involving the
 
Government Defendants. Both motions were granted in part and
 
denied in part.
 
On November 3, 2009, the jury returned a special
 
verdict in favor of Costales. The jury allocated fault as
 
follows: 62% to Rosete, 9% to Ando, 15% to Yoshimoto, and 14% to
 
the State. The jury awarded general damages to Costales in the 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
following amounts: $200,000 from Rosete in his official capacity
 
and $200,000 in his individual capacity, $100,000 from Ando in
 
his official capacity and $50,000 in his individual capacity,
 
$150,000 from Yoshimoto in his official capacity and $150,000 in
 
his individual capacity, and $300,000 from the State.
 
On March 8, 2010, Rosete, in his individual capacity,
 
filed his "Motion For Judgment As A Matter of Law and Alternative
 
Motion For a New Trial." On March 9, 2010, Government Defendants
 
filed their Motion For A New Trial. On June 1, 2010, the circuit
 
court granted Government Defendants' motion for a new trial (June
 
1, 2010 Order Granting New Trial). On June 2, 2010, the circuit
 
court denied Rosete's motion for judgment as a matter of law, but
 
granted his alternative motion for a new trial (June 2, 2010
 
Order Granting New Trial).
 
On June 9, 2010, Costales filed her Motion for
 
Reconsideration of June 1, 2010 Order Granting New Trial. On
 
June 10, 2010, Costales filed her Motion for Reconsideration of
 
June 2, 2010 Order Granting New Trial. The circuit court denied
 
both motions for reconsideration.
 
On June 30, 2010, Costales filed a motion for
 
interlocutory appeal of the June 1, 2010 Order Granting New
 
Trial. On July 1, 2010, Costales filed a motion for
 
interlocutory appeal of the June 2, 2010 Order Granting New
 
Trial. On August 27, 2010, the circuit court granted Costales'
 
motions for interlocutory appeal. On August 17, 2010, Costales
 
timely appealed. On August 31, 2010, Rosete filed his notice of
 
cross-appeal and on the same day, Government Defendants filed
 
their notice of cross-appeal.
 
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW
 
A. Motion For a New Trial 
"Both the grant and the denial of a motion for new
 
trial is within the trial court's discretion, and [the appellate
 
court] will not reverse that decision absent a clear abuse of
 
discretion." Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Hawai'i 214, 251, 948 P.2d 1055, 1092 (1997) (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted). "A court abuses its discretion 
whenever it exceeds the bounds of reason or disregards rules or 
principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a 
party." Abastillas v. Kekona, 87 Hawai' i 446, 449, 958 P.2d 
1136, 1139 (1998) (internal quotation marks, citation, and ellipsis omitted). 
B. Motion to Dismiss
 
"A trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss is 
reviewed de novo." Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel, 
117 Hawai' i 92, 104, 176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008). 
C. Admissibility
 
"A trial court's determination that evidence is 
'relevant' within the meaning of HRE [Hawaii Rules of Evidence] Rule 401 (1993) is reviewed under the right/wrong standard of 
review." State v. St. Clair, 101 Hawai' i 280, 286, 67 P.3d 779, 
785 (2003). 
HRE Rule 402 provides that "[a]ll relevant evidence is
 
admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitutions of
 the United States and the State of Hawaii, by statute, by these
 
rules, or by other rules adopted by the supreme court. Evidence
 
which is not relevant is not admissible."
 
Both rules are subject to HRE Rule 403, however, which
 
provides that "[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if
 
its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of
 
unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the
 
jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or
 
needless presentation of cumulative evidence." Whether relevant
 
evidence is admissible under Rule 403 is a determination well-
suited to a circuit court's exercise of discretion because it
 
requires a "cost-benefit calculus" and a "delicate balance
 
between probative value and prejudicial effect." Kaeo v. Davis,
 
68 Haw. 447, 454, 719 P.2d 387, 392 (1986) (internal quotation
 marks and citations omitted). Admission of relevant evidence
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
will be reviewed for an abuse of discretion. State v. Cordeiro, 
99 Hawai' i 390, 404, 56 P.3d 692, 706 (2002). 
III. DISCUSSION
 
A.	 Rosete's and Government Defendants' Cross-Appeals2
 
1.	 The circuit court did not err in denying
Government Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.
 
Government Defendants contend that Costales' claims
 
were barred by the two-year statute of limitations imposed on
 
tort claims against the State. HRS § 662-4 (1993) provides that
 
"[a] tort claim against the State shall be forever barred unless
 
action is begun within two years after the claim accrues, except
 
in the case of a medical tort claim when the limitation of action
 
provisions set forth in section 657-7.3 shall apply." Government
 
Defendants argue that because Costales alleged in her complaint
 
she was sexually assaulted in January or February of 2002 but her
 
complaint was not filed until December of 2007, more than five
 
years after the alleged assaults took place, the statute of
 
limitations had run.
 
Our courts have interpreted the word “accrues” under
HRS § 662-4 to mean that the statute does not begin to run
until the plaintiff knew or should have known of thedefendant's negligence. The Hawai' i Supreme Court later
interpreted a similar statute of limitations, HRS § 657-7(1993), to mean that a claim against the State “accrues”when the claimant discovers, or through the use ofreasonable diligence should have discovered, (1) the damage;(2) the violation of the duty [to the claimant]; and (3) the
causal connection between the violation of the duty and the
damage.
 
Anderson v. State, 88 Hawai' i 241, 247, 965 P.2d 783, 789 (1998) 
(internal citations, quotation marks, and footnote omitted). The 
Hawai'i Supreme Court has further stated that the issue of when a 
victim discovered, or should have discovered, his/her injuries or the cause of those injuries is a question of fact for the jury. 
2
 This court will first address the arguments of Rosete's and
Government Defendants' cross-appeals. Because many of the points on appeal
made by the cross-appellants overlap, the points will be addressed
concurrently.
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Dunlea v. Dappen, 83 Haw. 28, 36, 924 P.2d 196, 204 (1996), 
overruled on other grounds by Hac v. Univ. of Hawai' i, 102 Hawai' i 
92, 73 P.3d 46 (2003). In Dunlea, the supreme court vacated the circuit court's dismissal of a childhood sexual abuse claim, 
concluding that a reasonable jury could have found Dunlea did not 
discover the source of injuries until decades after the sexual 
abuse took place. Id. 
When a motion to dismiss is reviewed on appeal, an
 
appellate court 
must accept plaintiff's allegations as true and view them in
the light most favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is
proper only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff
can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim
that would entitle him or her to relief.
 
Wong v. Cayetano, 111 Hawai' i 462, 476, 143 P.3d 1, 15 (2006) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because 
Costales' allegations and declaration in support thereof, when 
viewed in the light most favorable to Costales, could prove the 
claims set forth in the complaint, denial of the motion to 
dismiss was proper. 
2.	 The circuit court did not err in denying Ando's
and Yoshimoto's Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
Government Defendants argue the circuit court erred in
 
denying Ando's and Yoshimoto's Motion for Summary Judgment
 
because Ando and Yoshimoto have qualified immunity under Towse v.
 
State, 64 Haw. 624, 647 P.2d 696 (1982). In Towse, the Hawai' i 
Supreme Court, citing to Medeiros v. Kondo, 55 Haw. 499, 522 P.2d
 
1269 (1974), stated that
 
non-judicial governmental officials, when acting in the
performance of their public duty, enjoy the protection of
what has been termed a qualified or conditional privilege.
This privilege effectively shields the official from
liability, and not from the imposition of the suit itself,
to the extent that the privilege is not abused and thereby
lost. Hence, we made clear in Kondo, that in order for an
action to lie against an official acting under a claim of
privilege, it is essential that the injured party allege and
prove, to the requisite degree, that the official had been
motivated by malice and not by an otherwise proper purpose
.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Towse, 64 Haw. at 631-32, 647 P.2d at 702 (internal citations and
 
footnotes omitted).
 
The supreme court has often articulated that "summary 
judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the 
affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any 
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment 
as a matter of law." Querubin v. Thronas, 107 Hawai' i 48, 56, 
109 P.3d 689, 697 (2005) (quoting Durette v. Aloha Plastic Recycling, Inc., 105 Hawai' i 490, 501, 100 P.3d 60, 71 (2004)). 
In the instant case, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Ando and Yoshimoto acted with malice. 
It is undisputed that Costales alleged malice in her
 
complaint. In her opposition to the motion for summary judgment,
 
Costales attached numerous exhibits which raised a genuine issue
 
of material fact as to whether Ando and Yoshimoto acted with
 
malice under the circumstances. The only evidence cited by Ando
 
and Yoshimoto in their motion for summary judgment was deposition
 
testimony from Costales stating she did not believe that Ando and
 
Yoshimoto "wanted something bad" to happen to her. In light of
 
the exhibits presented by Costales, this deposition testimony is
 
not enough to show there was no genuine issue of material fact. 
Therefore, the circuit court did not err in denying Ando's and
 
Yoshimoto's Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
3.	 The circuit court did not err in allowing evidence
of prior and subsequent bad acts of the Government
Defendants.
 
Rosete and Government Defendants argue the circuit
 
court erroneously admitted evidence of prior bad acts. When
 
judging the admissibility of evidence, "[e]vidence of other
 
similar accidents or occurrences may be relevant circumstantially
 
to show a defective or dangerous condition, notice thereof or
 
causation on the occasion in question." Kaeo, 68 Haw. at 455,
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
719 P.2d at 393 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
Before evidence of previous accidents or occurrence can be
 
admitted, "it must first be shown . . . that the conditions under
 
which the alleged previous accidents occurred were the same or
 
substantially similar to the one in question." Kaeo, 68 Haw. at
 
456, 719 P.2d at 393 (citation omitted). The degree to which the
 conditions must be similar "is much relaxed, however, when the
 
purpose of the offered evidence is to show notice, since all that
 
is required here is that the previous accident [or occurrence]
 
should be such as to attract the defendant's attention to the
 
dangerous situation which resulted in the litigated accident." 
Warshaw v. Rockresorts, Inc, 57 Haw. 645, 652, 562 P.2d 428, 434
 
(1977)) (internal quotation marks, citation, ellipsis, and
 
parentheses omitted; brackets added).
 
i.	 Testimony of Carl Imakyure (Imakyure), Harold
Fitchett (Fitchett), Linda Hadley (Hadley), and
Yoshimoto
 
Rosete argues the circuit court erred in admitting the
 
testimony of Imakyure, Fitchett, Hadley, and Yoshimoto,
 
contending that the evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial to
 
Rosete. Whether evidence is admissible under HRE Rule 403 is a
 
"determination well-suited to a trial court's exercise of
 
discretion because it requires a cost-benefit calculus and a
 
delicate balance between probative value and prejudicial effect." 
Kaeo, 68 Haw. at 454, 719 P.2d at 392 (1986) (internal quotation
 
marks and citations omitted). "[E]vidence with a capacity for
 
unfair prejudice cannot be equated with testimony simply adverse
 
to the opposing party; for evidence is only material if it is
 
prejudicial in some relevant respect." Kaeo, 68 Haw. at 454, 719
 
P.2d at 392. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in
 admitting the testimony of Imakyure, Fitchett, Hadley, and
 
Yoshimoto. 
11
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ii.	 The circuit court did not err in allowing excerpts
from the deposition of former HYCF teacher Susan
Thain (Thain).
 
Rosete similarly challenges the admission of Susan
 
Thain's deposition testimony, arguing it prejudiced Rosete. 
Thain was a teacher at HYCF during the time the alleged sexual
 
assaults took place. She reported "that she heard of verbal,
 
sexual and physical abuse prior to [Costales'] assault." Thain's
 
testimony was limited to issues relevant to the case and to the
 
time period from 1996 to the date of Costales' last alleged
 
assault in 2002. Evidence of the prior similar instances was
 
admissible to show notice. Because Thain's testimony concerned
 
similar instances leading up and prior to Costales' assault, the
 
circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Thain's
 
deposition testimony. 
iii. The circuit court did not err in allowing excerpts
from the deposition of former HYCF guard Lia
O'lione (O' lione). 
Rosete and Government Defendants argue the circuit 
court erred in allowing the deposition testimony of former HYCF 
guard O'lione. Government Defendants contend that when the 
circuit court initially granted in part and denied in part their motion in limine, it ruled that evidence concerning Government 
Defendants' other lawsuits was not admissible. Government 
Defendants argue the circuit court erred by later reversing its 
order at trial. However, "[c]ourts can initially rule on a 
motion in limine and reverse themselves where, for example, the 
party seeking to exclude evidence 'opens the door' to the 
evidence initially excluded." Barcai v. Betwee, 98 Hawai'i 470, 
494 n.3, 50 P.3d 946, 970 n.3 (2002). 
At trial, Yoshimoto acknowledged that O' lione, an 
officer under his supervision, had been charged and convicted of a 2003 sexual assault of another HYCF ward, thereby opening the 
12
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
door to further exploration of this assault. Because Yoshimoto
 
opened the door to the occurrence of a subsequent sexual assault,
 
the circuit court did not err in allowing evidence of that
 
assault.
 
iv.	 Evidence of the Government Defendants' bad acts
 
was not overly prejudicial.
 
Rosete contends that evidence of Government Defendants' 
prior bad acts was unfairly prejudicial to him. When the circuit 
court gave its jury instructions, it told the jury to consider 
the evidence against each defendant separately. Specifically, 
the jury instruction read: "[E]ach defendant in this case has 
separate and distinct rights. You must decide the case of each 
defendant separately, as if it were a separate lawsuit." Because 
Rosete failed to show how evidence of Government Defendants' 
prior bad acts prejudiced him and because "jurors are presumed to 
follow the court's instructions," we conclude the evidence of the 
prior bad acts was not overly prejudicial and circuit court did 
not err in admitting the prior bad act evidence. State v. 
Haanio, 94 Hawai' i 405, 415, 16 P.3d 246, 256 (2001). 
4.	 The circuit court did not err in allowing excerpts
of the DOJ's report.
 
Government Defendants contend the circuit court erred
 
in admitting DOJ's August 4, 2005 report (Report) regarding its
 
2004-05 investigation of HYCF. Government Defendants argue the
 
Report discussed events that took place after the alleged assault
 
by Rosete, and as such, would not serve to give notice of that
 
assault.
 
Costales correctly points out the Report contains
 
information of events that occurred both prior to and after the
 
alleged 2002 sexual assaults. Costales also correctly points out
 
that circuit court limited evidence to those portions of the
 
Report relevant to the instant case.
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Furthermore, the admissibility of this very Report has
 
been ruled on in the United States District Court for the
 
District of Hawai' i (District Court) under similar circumstances. 
In R.G. v. Koller, 415 F.Supp.2d 1129, 1133 n.1 (D. Haw. 2006),
 the District Court found that
 
The DOJ Report, admissible pursuant to Fed.R.Evid.
803(8), makes detailed factual findings regarding the
conditions, policies, patterns and practices at HYCF as of
October 2004. Those findings are the result of a thorough
on-site investigation by neutral investigators from a
government agency charged with the responsibility of seeking
“remedies for any pattern or practice of conduct that
violates the constitutional or federal statutory rights of
children in juvenile justice institutions." 
(citation omitted). While the events in dispute in Koller
 
occurred after the Report was completed, the issue of
 
admissibility is analogous to the present case. Because the
 
Report contained facts of incidents prior to the Costales assault
 
and provided a description of conditions during that time period,
 
the circuit court did not err in ruling that portions of the
 
Report were both relevant and admissible.
 
5.	 The jury was not confused.
 
Rosete contends the special verdict by the jury
 
rendered "two conflicting and irreconcilable allocations of
 
liability and damages as between the defendants," thus
 
demonstrating the jury's confusion. Rosete argues that the
 
disparity between the jury's finding that negligence by
 
Government Defendants caused 82% of the general damages but the
 
intentional tort by Rosete caused only 18% of the general damages
 
was evidence of the jury's confusion. Rosete cites to no
 
authority stating that an intentional tortfeasor must bear a
 
greater percent of the fault then a negligent tortfeasor. 
6.	 HRS § 662-10 does not preclude judgment against
both the State of Hawai' i and Rosete in his 
individual capacity. 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Rosete contends that HRS § 662-10 precludes judgment
 
against Rosete in his individual capacity when there also has
 
been a judgment against Government Defendants. HRS § 662-10
 
states that "[t]he judgment in an action under this chapter shall
 
constitute a complete bar to any action by the claimant, by
 
reason of the same subject matter, against the employee of the
 
State whose act or omission gave rise to the claim." Plainly
 
read, the statute precludes subsequent claims on the same subject
 
matter, but does not bar claims against multiple defendants.
 
28 U.S.C. § 2676 is similar to HRS § 662-10, providing
 
that "[t]he judgment in an action under section 1346(b) of this
 
title shall constitute a complete bar to any action by the
 
claimant, by reason of the same subject matter, against the
 
employee of the government whose act or omission gave rise to the
 
claim." The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
 
has held that "§ 2676 is applicable only after a plaintiff
 
obtains a judgment against the United States. In this case the
 
judgment against the United States was entered at the same time
 
as the judgment against the individual. Therefore, the individual
 
defendants could not have plead § 2676 as an affirmative
 
defense." Rodriguez v. Handy, 873 F.2d 814, 816 n.1 (5th Cir.
 
1989). Because the judgment against Rosete was entered at the
 same time as the judgment against Government Defendants, 
HRS § 662-10 does not bar judgment against either Rosete or
 
Government Defendants.
 
B.	 Costales' Appeal
 
On appeal, Costales challenges the circuit court's
 
granting of Rosete's and Government Defendants' motions for a new
 
trial. 
1.	 The circuit court did not err in finding that an
irreconcilable conflict existed in the jury's
answers on the special verdict form.
 
15
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Costales argues the circuit court erred when it found 
that "an irreconcilable conflict exists between the jury's 
answers in the percentage allocation of fault amongst the 
defendants and the monetary damages allocated amongst the 
defendants." The Hawai' i Supreme Court has held that "a conflict 
in the jury's answers to questions in a special verdict will warrant a new trial only if those answers are irreconcilably 
inconsistent, and the verdict will not be disturbed if the 
answers can be reconciled under any theory." Miyamoto v. Lum, 
104 Hawai' i 1, 8, 84 P.3d 509, 516 (2004) (internal quotation 
marks, brackets, and citation omitted). "It is essential that 
the party seeking to set aside a verdict on the ground of 
conflict must be able to point out that one of the conflicting 
answers of the jury . . . necessarily requires the entry of a 
judgment different from that which the court has entered." Id. 
at 9, 84 P.3d at 517 (quoting Vieau v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 3 Haw. App. 492, 499, 653 P.2d 1161, 1166 (1982) (citation 
omitted). In Miyamoto, the court concluded that a jury's finding 
that a defendant was not the legal cause of patient's injuries 
was irreconcilably inconsistent with an award of $18,446 in 
damages. Id. 
The conflict in the present case is likewise
 
irreconcilably inconsistent. The percentages of fault as
 assigned under question 10 in the special verdict form are
 
substantially different from the percentages of damages as
 
assigned under question 12. Of the total general damages
 
awarded, Rosete's share equals approximately 35%, Ando's share
 
approximately 13%, Yoshimoto's share approximately 26%, and the
 
State's share approximately 26%. These percentages differ
 
greatly from the percentages of fault assigned under question 10,
 
which found Rosete's share to be 62%, Ando's share 9%,
 
Yoshimoto's share 15%, and the State's share 14%. Thus, under
 
the standard in Miyamoto, to apply the answers in question 10 and
 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
ignore the answers in question 12 would "require the entry of
 
judgment different from that which the court has entered." Id. 
The circuit court did not err in finding an irreconcilable
 conflict in the jury's answers.
 
2.	 The dismissed jurors' declarations were precluded
from consideration by the circuit court.
 
Costales contends the circuit court erred in denying
 
her motions for reconsideration of the orders for a new trial in
 
light of declarations by the former jurors stating the intent of
 
the jury. Costales argues that the declarations clarify it was
 
the intent of the jury to declare Rosete and Government
 
Defendants "liable to [Costales] to the extent of the dollar
 
amounts indicated in the answers to question 12," not to the
 
percentage of fault allocated in the answers to question 10.
 
HRE Rule 606(b) states:
 
Inquiry into validity of verdict or indictment. Upon
an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a
juror may not testify concerning the effect of anything upon
the juror's or any other juror's mind or emotions as
influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the
verdict or indictment or concerning the juror's mental
processes in connection therewith. Nor may the juror's
affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror
indicating an effect of this kind be received
.
 
The commentary to HRE Rule 606 explains that "[t]he intent of
 
this subsection is to strike a proper balance by excluding
 
testimony relating to the internal deliberative process and
 
allowing testimony about objective misconduct and
 
irregularities." HRE Rule 606 cmt. 
By asking the circuit court to consider the
 
declarations of the former jurors, Costales was asking the
 
circuit court to determine the intent of the jury and to choose
 
one verdict (the answers to question 12) over another (the
 
answers to question 10). Such a determination would be contrary
 
to HRE Rule 606; therefore, the circuit court did not err in
 
17
  
 
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
denying Costales' motions for reconsideration to the extent of
 
not considering the dismissed jurors' declarations. 
3.	 Joint and several liability does not apply.
 
Costales contends that a new trial to determine the
 
allocation of money damages among Rosete, Yoshimoto, and Ando is
 
not necessary because they are jointly and severally liable with
 
the State.
 
HRS § 663-10.5 (Supp. 2011) abolished joint and several
liability for the State:
Any other law to the contrary notwithstanding,
including but not limited to sections 663-10.9, 663-11 to
663-13, 663-16, 663-17, and 663-31, in any case where a
government entity is determined to be a tortfeasor along
with one or more other tortfeasors, the government entity
shall be liable for no more than that percentage share of
the damages attributable to the government entity; provided
that joint and several liability shall be retained for tort
claims relating to the maintenance and design of highways
pursuant to section 663-10.9.
 
Because HRS § 663-10.5 bars the application of joint and several
 
liability in the present case, Rosete alone is liable for the
 
general damages the jury awarded against him.
 
4.	 The circuit court erred in denying Costales'
motions for reconsideration to limit the issues in
 a new trial.
 
Costales contends the circuit court erred in denying
 
her motions for reconsideration insofar as limiting the new trial
 
to the allocation of damages among the defendants. Costales
 
argues the denial of the motions was in error because Rosete and
 
Government Defendants do not dispute that the combined fault was
 
100% nor argue that the award of damages was unreasonable.
 
i.	 The motion for reconsideration timely raised the
issue of limiting the scope of the new trial.
 
In response to Costales' argument, Rosete and
 
Government Defendants argue Costales' request to limit the issue
 
in the new trial to the allocation of damages was untimely
 
because the request should have been raised in the prior
 
18
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
proceedings. They contend Costales raised this argument for the
 
first time in her motions for reconsideration and argue that a
 
party is not allowed to raise new arguments that could have been
 
brought earlier.
 
A motion for reconsideration allows "the parties to 
present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been 
presented during the earlier adjudicated motion. Reconsideration 
is not a device to relitigate old matters or to raise arguments 
or evidence that could and should have been brought during the 
earlier proceeding." Ass'n of Apartment Owners of Wailea Elua v. 
Wailea Resort Co., Ltd., 100 Hawai' i 97, 110, 58 P.3d 608, 621 
(2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
Costales' request to limit the issues at a new trial 
"could not have been presented during the earlier adjudicated 
motion" because, until a new trial was granted, there was no call 
for a request to limit issues at a new trial. Wailea Elua, 100 
Hawai'i at 110, 58 P.3d at 621. Therefore, Costales' motions for 
reconsideration were timely filed pursuant to Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 59(e). 
ii.	 The circuit court erred in not limiting the new
trial to the issue of damages.
 
"As a general matter, the granting or denial of a 
motion for new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of 
discretion." State v. Yamada, 108 Hawai' i 474, 478, 122 P.3d 
254, 258 (2005). It is also within the court's discretion to limit a new trial to the question of damages. Cozine v. Hawaiian 
Catamaran, Ltd, 49 Haw. 267, 268, 414 P.2d 428, 429 (1966) (citations omitted). 
In Dias v. Vanek, 67 Haw. 114, 118, 679 P.2d 133, 136 
(1984), the Hawai' i Supreme Court concluded that "[t]he preferred 
remedy of an ambiguous verdict is to have the jurors return to clarify the verdict. Here, the jury had been discharged, and the 
19
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
only available remedy is a remand for a new trial limited to the
 
issue of damages[.]"
 
The circuit court, in granting Rosete's and Government
 
Defendants' motions for a new trial, stated "[t]he court finds
 
that an irreconcilable conflict exists between the jury's answers
 
in the percentage allocation of fault amongst the defendants and
 
the monetary damages allocated amongst the defendants." The
 
circuit court ignored the supreme court's conclusion in Dias that
 
the preferred remedy for such a verdict is a new trial limited to
 
the issue of damages. By not limiting the new trial to the issue
 
of the allocation of fault and damages among the defendants, the
 
circuit court erred.
