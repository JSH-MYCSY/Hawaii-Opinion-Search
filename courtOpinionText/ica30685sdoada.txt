IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAIf I 
HEATHER AIONA-AGRA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
JAYSON JAVIER AGRA, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT
 
(FC-D 06-1-0044)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Fujise, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Jayson Javier Agra (Husband)
 
appeals from the decree granting a divorce (Divorce Decree) to
 
Plaintiff-Appellee Heather Aiona-Agra (Wife) and the child
 
support order entered on July 21, 2010, by the Family Court of
 
the Third Circuit (family court).1
 
Husband sought to enforce an agreement that he and Wife
 
signed during a voluntary mediation session after she filed for
 
divorce. Under one term in the agreement, Husband would give
 
Wife an "equalization payment" in exchange for her surrendering
 
any rights to the couple's residence, which Husband had purchased
 
before marriage but while the couple lived together. Wife argued
 
she had been fraudulently induced into the agreement because
 
during the mediation, Husband had represented that he had
 
obtained an appraisal that valued the residence significantly
 
lower than an earlier appraisal. The family court concluded the

mediation agreement was unenforceable because: (1) it was
 
fraudulently induced; (2) it was unconscionable where "its
 
presumed result would be unjustly disproportionate;" and (3)
 
because Husband's purported statements during mediation created
 
an "unfair surprise" regarding the value of the marital property. 
After rejecting the mediation agreement, the family court divided
 
the property as Category 5 property.

On appeal, Husband alleges  the family court erred by:
(1)
 creating a "circular decision" when it added footnotes to its
 
Decision and Findings of Fact/Conclusions of Law (FOF/COL) and
 "removing the reasoning it followed" in the Decision when it
 
drafted the FOF/COL; (2) and (3) denying Husband's two motions
 
for summary judgment; (4) finding that Husband made a fraudulent
 
misrepresentation during the mediation; (5) finding that the
 
"statement of material fact" element for fraudulent inducement
 
was proven by the representation that an appraisal existed given
 
that an appraisal is an opinion, not fact; (6) finding that Wife
 
reasonably relied on the representation; (7) concluding that the
 
mediation agreement was unconscionable and therefore
 
unenforceable; (8) denying a motion to quash Wife's subpoena to
 
mediators; (9) finding that a pre-marital economic partnership
 
existed; (10) allowing Wife's testimony regarding the mediation
 
over his hearsay objections; (11) awarding Wife sole legal and
 
sole physical custody of the children; (12) retroactively
 
adjusting child support to 2006; (13) not imputing income to Wife
 
for child support purposes; (14) setting child support without a
 
hearing; and (15) dividing the parties' property based on its
 
2
 Husband's Amended Opening Brief does not adhere to Hawaif i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b). In particular, the brief does not
set forth "all supporting and contradictory evidence . . . 
in summary
fashion, with appropriate record references[,]" 
HRAP Rule 28(b)(3) (emphasis
added), does not specify "where in the record the alleged error occurred" forseveral errors, HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(ii), and where the error involves theadmission of evidence, he does not include "a quotation of the grounds urgedfor the objection and the full substance of the evidence admitted orrejected." HRAP Rule 28(b)(4)(A). Counsel is cautioned that future violations may result in sanctions.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
conclusion that there was a premarital economic partnership and
 
its rejection of the mediation agreement.
 
Upon careful review of the records and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant law, we resolve Husband's appeal as
 
follows:3
 
(1) Husband objects to the family court's entry, upon 
the order by this court, of the FOF/COL on the basis that an 
earlier-filed Decision is longer and more descriptive, but the 
FOF/COL is summary and "eliminates the reasoning" in the 
Decision. Husband does not allege that the court eliminated 
necessary findings from the FOF/COL. When the FOF/COL and 
Decision are read together in their entirety as intended by the 
family court, they do not contradict each other. Even if the 
family court eliminated the reasoning found in the Decision when 
writing the FOF/COL, such a change would be irrelevant because we 
review the family court's conclusions of law de novo. Inoue v. 
Inoue, 118 Hawaif i 86, 93, 185 P.3d 834, 841 (App. 2008). 
(2) and (3) The family court did not err in denying 
Husband's motions for summary judgment, which sought to enforce the mediation agreement, where several genuine issues of material 
fact existed. See Schenk v. Schenk, 103 Hawaif i 303, 309, 81 
P.3d 1218, 1224 (App. 2003). The most significant of these facts, as noted in the family court, was whether the mediation 
agreement might be unconscionable, which could only be determined 
after fully reviewing the value of the marital estate, which was 
in dispute. Given that Husband failed to show that there was "no 
genuine issue as to any material fact" and that he was "entitled 
to judgment as a matter of law," the family court correctly 
denied him summary judgment. Id. 
(7) The family court did not err by invalidating the
 
mediation agreement on the basis that it was unconscionable. 
3
 We address Husband's points of error in non-sequential order.
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Unconscionability encompasses two basic principles: one-sidedness
 
and unfair surprise. Lewis v. Lewis, 69 Haw. 497, 502, 748 P.2d
 
1362, 1366 (1988). "[O]ne-sidedness would mean that the
 agreement leaves a post-divorce economic situation that is
 
unjustly disproportionate. Unfair surprise would mean that one
 
party did not have full and adequate knowledge of the other
 
party's financial condition when the . . . agreement was
 
executed." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
 
Husband contends that the family court's conclusion
 
that the mediation agreement was unconscionable erroneously
 
relied on the finding that the property was acquired during a
 
premarital economic partnership, which the family court
 
determined at trial well after the agreement was signed. This
 
argument fails because the facts relevant to whether the couple
 
had a premarital economic partnership existed and were known to
 
the parties at the time the mediation agreement was executed. 
Thus, the family court could consider them in making its
 
unconscionability determination. See Lewis, 69 Haw. at 507, 748
 
P.2d at 1369 ("unconscionability of a provision governing
 division of property in a []marital agreement should be evaluated
 
at the time the agreement was executed").
 
Second, assuming arguendo that Husband and Wife had no
 
premarital economic partnership, the mediation agreement was
 
unjustly disproportionate because it provided Wife with less than
 
half of what she would be entitled to under the most favorable
 
position that Husband could reasonably maintain at the time the
 
agreement was signed.
 
Without an agreement to exclude the home from the
 
marital partnership, the home was Marital Partnership Property
 
and divisible under the five-category scheme outlined in Tougas
 
v. Tougas, 76 Hawaif i 19, 27-28, 868 P.2d 437, 445-46 (1994). 
See also Helbush v. Helbush, 108 Hawaif i 508, 511-12, 122 P.3d 
288, 291-92 (App. 2005). Without the mediation agreement, 
Husband could at most maintain that he deserved a Category 1 
credit of $218,000 for the net market value of the home on the 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
date of marriage (DOM), and the couple should split any post-
marriage appreciation. See id. Under such a scheme, and based
 
on the $900,000 appraisal--the only appraisal that the parties
 showed was in existence at the time of the mediation, Wife would
 
be entitled to fifty percent of the appreciation in the net
 
market value of the home, or $257,500.
4 The mediation agreement
 
calls for an equalization payment of $123,000, that is $134,500
 less than her partnership share.
 
Husband's argument regarding the one-sidedness of the
 
agreement is wrong because it does not subtract the mortgage
 
outstanding on the date of marriage, which has the effect of
 
inflating the Category 1 credit he claims.
 
We acknowledge that "a merely 'inequitable' contract is 
not unenforceable under contract law." Epp v. Epp, 80 Hawaif i 79, 
85, 905 P.2d 54, 60 (App. 1995) (citation omitted). However, the question here is whether the disproportionate result of the 
mediation agreement rises to the level of being "unacceptably 
one-sided." See Lewis, 69 Haw. at 507, 748 P.3d at 1369. After 
a review of the record, we agree with the family court that the mediation agreement was unacceptably one-sided in favor of 
Husband. Under the agreement, Wife would receive less than half 
of what she would have received if the house were Category 1 
property, despite that Wife argued she might have been entitled 
to more if the family court considered the home to be Category 5 
property, without any offset. Husband did not agree to give Wife 
additional property, for example, a larger share of Husband's 
retirement, or make any other offsetting payment. 
(4), (5) and (6) Because we conclude that the mediation
 
agreement was unconscionable because it was unacceptably one-
sided, we affirm the family court's determination that the
 
mediation agreement was unenforceable without considering whether
 
Wife was fraudulently induced to enter the agreement or whether

5

the mediation agreement was unconscionable due to "unfair
 
surprise."
 
(9) The family court did not err in finding that the 
couple had a premarital economic partnership. "[A] 'premarital 
economic partnership' occurs when, prior to their subsequent 
marriage, a man and a woman cohabit and apply their financial 
resources as well as their individual energies and efforts to and 
for the benefit of each other's person, assets, and liabilities." 
Helbush, 108 Hawaif i at 515, 122 P.3d at 295. Whether the 
parties cohabitated and had an economic partnership prior to marriage are questions of fact. See Jackson v. Jackson, 84 
Hawaifi 319, 324, 933 P.2d 1353, 1358 (App. 1997). As such, the 
court's finding regarding the partnership is reversible only if 
it is clearly erroneous. See Inoue, 118 Hawaif i at 92, 185 P.3d 
at 841. 
Husband claims that the family court's finding that the 
parties cohabitated prior to marriage "was an improper expansion of the definition of 'cohabitation[,]'" yet he offered no 
alternative definition for cohabitation at trial or on appeal. 
The family court's finding of cohabitation was based on the 
definition of the term in Black's Law Dictionary and Husband's 
and Wife's testimony. Giving "due regard . . . to the 
opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the 
witnesses," Hawaif i Family Court Rules (HFCR) Rule 52(a), we 
conclude that the family court's finding of cohabitation is supported by the record and not clearly erroneous. 
Similarly, the family court's finding that Husband and 
Wife had an economic partnership was not clearly erroneous. See 
Jackson, 84 Hawaif i at 332-33, 933 P.2d at 1366-67). Husband's 
position that the record "fail[s] to evidence a single 'financial 
resource' from [Wife] prior to the marriage" ignores the fact 
that the partnership model considers more than just monetary 
contributions to the partnership. See Helbush, 108 Hawaif i at 
515, 122 P.3d at 295 (quoting Cassiday v. Cassiday, 68 Haw. 383, 387, 716 P.2d 1133, 1136 (1986) ("partners bring their financial 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
resources as well as their individual energies and efforts"). 
The unchallenged findings of fact establish that Wife contributed 
some "individual energies and efforts" to the construction of the 
home and Husband lived rent-free with Wife and with Wife's 
family, as a direct benefit of his relationship with Wife. The 
weight to be assigned to Wife's contributions was for the family 
court to decide. See Helbush, 108 Hawaif i at 515, 122 P.3d at 
295. The family court's finding that the couple had a premarital
 
economic partnership was supported by the record.
 
(8) The family court was not plainly arbitrary in 
refusing to quash the subpoena of the Mediation Center. The 
family court correctly noted that Hawaif i Rules of Evidence (HRE) 
5
Rule 408  does not grant a privilege to withhold informationobtained in a mediation, because the rule is "a rule of 
admissibility." 
There was no privilege to withhold the mediation 
center's records. See HRE Rule 501 (there are no privileges from 
testifying, disclosure, or production of materials, except where 
provided by state or federal law or court rule). 
Therefore, the 
family court's denial of the motion to quash was not plainly arbitrary or erroneous. See Bank of Hawaii v. Shaw, 83 Hawaif i 
50, 59, 924 P.2d 544, 553 (App. 1996) (interpreting Rule 45 
5
 HRE Rule 408 reads:
 
Compromise, offers to compromise, and mediation proceedings.
Evidence of (1) furnishing or offering or promising to
furnish, or (2) accepting or offering or promising to
accept, a valuable consideration in compromising or
attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to
either validity or amount, or (3) mediation or attempts to
mediate a claim which was disputed, is not admissible to
prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its
amount. Evidence of conduct or statements made in
 compromise negotiations or mediation proceedings is likewise
not admissible. This rule does not require the exclusion of
any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is
presented in the course of compromise negotiations or
mediation proceedings. This rule also does not require
exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose,
such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness, negativing a
contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct
a criminal investigation or prosecution.

District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP), which is similar
 
to HFCR Rule 45(b)).
 
The family court did not err in allowing Wife or 
mediators to testify on the basis that their testimony fell into 
the exception in HRE Rule 408. "[W]hether the evidence was 
offered for 'another purpose' and qualified as an exception to 
the general prohibition [in Rule 408]. . . requires a judgment 
call on the part of the trial court and is reviewed for abuse of 
discretion." Han v. Yang, 84 Hawaif i 162, 169, 931 P.2d 604, 611 
(App. 1997). Fraud is clearly one of the circumstances that the legislature intended to exclude from Rule 408's prohibition on 
admitting mediation-related testimony. See H. Stand. Comm. Rep. 
No. 496, in 1989 House Journal, at 1023. Our review of the record reveals that Wife did not offer the testimony regarding 
what was said during mediation to prove how much she should 
receive in the property settlement, but rather to prove that her 
assent to the property division was fraudulently obtained. Thus, 
her testimony was not inadmissible under HRE Rule 408. 
Neither Husband nor the Mediation Center relied on the 
Confidentiality Pledge signed by the parties and mediators in 
their arguments to prohibit testimony regarding the mediation. 
See Onaka v. Onaka, 112 Hawaif i 374, 386, 146 P.3d 89, 101 (2006) 
("[t]he rule in this jurisdiction . . . prohibits an appellant from complaining for the first time on appeal of error to which 
he has acquiesced or to which he failed to object") (alteration 
in original, citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
Furthermore, Husband abandoned this point on appeal, where he 
failed to present argument. See HRAP Rule 28(b)(7). 
(10) Reviewing under the right/wrong standard, we 
conclude that the family court was correct when it decided that 
Wife's statements regarding Husband's "representation" during 
mediation about the value of the home were not hearsay. See 
Inoue, 118 Hawaif i at 93, 185 P.3d at 841. Hearsay is an out-of­
court statement "offered in evidence to prove the truth of the 
matter asserted." HRE Rule 801. The family court accurately 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
assessed that Wife's testimony was not offered to show that there
 
was an appraisal or that the property was worth $500,000, but
 
rather to show the circumstances surrounding the mediation
 
agreement's formation and to prove fraud.
 
(11) The family court did not err in granting sole 
physical and legal custody of the children to Wife. It is well 
established that "the best interests of the child standard is 
paramount when considering the issue of custody." Inoue, 118 
Hawaifi at 105, 185 P.3d at 853 (citation omitted). The court's 
finding, although denominated as a conclusion of law, that it was 
in the children's best interest that Wife have sole legal and 
physical custody was supported by the record and not clearly 
erroneous. 
Sole legal custody is consistent with the family
 
court's Decision that Husband be "entitled to full access to all
 
school and medical records" and "be informed . . . of all[ ]
 
important issues and decisions affecting the children's welfare." 
Contrary to what Husband asserts in his Amended Opening Brief,
 
the family court never "order[ed] that the parties agree on
 
numerous legal custody issues[.]" The family court did not abuse
 
its decision in awarding physical and legal custody of the
 
children to Wife.
 
(12) Husband waived his point of error regarding the
 
family court's "retroactive" adjustments to child support where
 
his argument section is silent regarding this point. See HRAP
 
Rule 28(b)(7) ("Points not argued may be deemed waived.").
 
(13) The family court did not err by not imputing 
income to Wife and excluding in-kind contributions that Wife received from her family as income in the child support 
calculations. Contrary to Husband's suggestion, the family court 
did not state that it could not impute income. Rather, in the 
paragraph of the Decision which he quotes in his Amending Opening 
Brief, the family court rejected Husband's reliance on Sussman v. 
Sussman, 112 Hawaif i 437, 146 P.3d 597 (App. 2006), which 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
concerned spousal support where this dispute concerned child
 
support.
 
Husband argues on appeal that the family court should
 
have imputed income to Wife because she was able to meet her
 
monthly expenses in excess of her reported income without
 
accumulating debt, but he provides no authority authorizing the
 
family court to impute income on this basis.
 
He also argues that financial help that Wife received 
from her parents in the form of free or reduced rent and use of 
vehicles from the family's business should be considered income. 
This argument does not ask the family court to impute income, but 
rather to classify this aid as income from a "gift." The family 
court's finding that this assistance was a loan, not a gift, is 
supported by the record. Assuming arguendo that Wife's family's 
assistance was a gift, Husband failed to prove it was 
"continuous," as the Hawaif i Child Support Guidelines pertaining 
to a parent's income require. Instructions for the 2004 Hawaif i 
Child Support Guidelines, reprinted in 1 Hawaii State Bar 
Association, 2005 Hawaif i Divorce Manual, § 4, Appx. 3 (7th ed. 
2005), available at http://www.state.hi.us/jud/Oahu/Family/2004csg/2004csg_ 
instructions.pdf, at 2. 
Most importantly, the family court found "no specific 
figures were established at trial as to the amount of benefits 
[Wife] received from her parents, either in the aggregate or on a 
monthly basis." If such figures are documented in the record, 
Husband fails to cite to them in his briefs. "The burden is upon 
appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in 
the record." Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawaif i 225, 230, 
909 P.2d 553, 558 (1995) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
(14) The family court did not abuse its discretion in
 
making the determination of child support based on the parties'
 
written submissions. HFCR Rule 78 permits the family court to
 
determine motions "without oral hearing upon brief written
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI fI REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
statements." The rules cited by Husband provide no basis to
 
require a hearing before the entry of a child support order, nor
 
did he request one below. Accordingly, this point is without
 
merit.
 
(15) The family court did not err in dividing the 
marital property. The mediation agreement was not a valid 
contract such that the residence could be considered Marital 
Separate Property. See Helbush, 108 Hawaif i at 512,122 P.3d at 
292. As noted above, the family court did not clearly err in 
determining that Husband and Wife had a premarital economic 
partnership that pre-dated the purchase of the residence. See id. 
at 513, 122 P.3d at 293; see also Doe v. Roe, 123 Hawaif i 299, 
233 P.3d 719, No. 28596 2010 WL 2535138, at *7 (App. June 23, 2010) (mem.). Thus, the residence could not be considered 
Husband's "contribution to Marital Partnership Property" where it 
was acquired during the partnership such that Husband was not 
entitled to repayment for his contribution. Helbush, 108 Hawaif i 
at 513-14, 122 P.3d at 293-94 (citing Hussey v. Hussey, 77 Hawaifi 202, 207–08, 881 P.2d 1270, 1275-76 (App. 1994)). The 
residence was correctly classified as Category 5 property. See 
id. at 512, 122 P.3d at 292. The family court did not err in so 
finding and dividing the property accordingly. 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Family Court of the Third
 
Circuit's July 21, 2010 Divorce Decree and the July 21, 2010
 order regarding the child support arrearage and monthly payment
 
are affirmed.
