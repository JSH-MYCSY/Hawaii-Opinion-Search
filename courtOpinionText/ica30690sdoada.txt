SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Leonard, Presiding Judge, Reifurth and Ginoza, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Everett Spears (Spears) appeals
 
from a June 24, 2010 Circuit Court of the Second Circuit (Circuit
 
Court) Sua Sponte Order (Sua Sponte Order), which rescinded an
 April 27, 2001 Stipulated Order Re: Jail Confinement (Stipulated
 
Order) and a May 8, 2001 Amended Stipulated Order Re: Jail
 Confinement (Amended Stipulated Order).

On April 29, 2000, Spears was arrested for burglary in 
the first degree and violation of order of protection. On May 
15, 2000, Plaintiff-Appellee State of Hawai� i (State) charged 
Spears in Cr. No. 00-1-0206 (Case 1) with five counts. On July 
3, 2000, while in custody for Case 1, Spears was indicted on two 
counts in Cr. No. 00-1-0333 (Case 2), which was unrelated to Case 
1.

 The Honorable Joseph E. Cardoza presided.
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
On November 14, 2000, Spears pleaded no contest to four
 
charges: in Case 1 - the reduced charge of criminal trespass in
 
the first degree in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 708-813 (Supp. 2011), criminal property damage in the fourth
 
degree in violation of HRS § 708-823 (1993), and harassment in
 
violation of HRS § 711-1106 (Supp. 2008) and, in Case 2 - assault
 
in the second degree in violation of HRS § 707-710 (1993). 
On January 11, 2001, the Circuit Court sentenced Spears
 
to five years of probation, subject to mandatory conditions,
 
including imprisonment for one year, in accordance with a plea
 
agreement. Spears' counsel pointed out that Spears should
 
receive preconfinement credit for Case 2 from April 29, 2000 and
 
not from July 12, 2000, as stated in Spears' certificate of
 
preconfinement credit, because Spears was taken into custody on
 
April 29, 2000 when he was arrested in connection with Case 1. 
For Case 1, the Circuit Court sentenced Spears as follows: one-
year jail sentence for Count One, thirty-day jail sentence for
 
Count Two, and thirty-day jail sentence for Count Five. For
 
Count One of Case 2, the Circuit Court sentenced Spears to five
 
years probation and one-year jail sentence. The Circuit Court
 
ordered that Spears would receive credit for time served and that
 
all sentences would run concurrently. 
On April 23, 2001, Spears filed a Motion to Clarify
 
Sentence in Case 2. On April 26, 2001, during a hearing on
 
Spears' Motion to Clarify Sentence, Spears said that under the
 
plea agreement, he "only accepted one year, not more than a
 
year." The prosecutor responded, "It would be totally
 
inappropriate for [Spears] to be serving more than a year." The
 
Circuit Court stated, "[Spears' counsel's] declaration says
 
scheduled for release on or about April 30. I don't know. Maybe
 
--" The prosecutor then said, "Quite frankly, your Honor, I took
 
that at face value. I didn't do any research whether or not that
 
was the appropriate date." The Circuit Court instructed Spears'
 
2
  
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
counsel to check with the correctional facility about when Spears
 
was taken into custody to determine when he is scheduled for
 
release. 
On April 27, 2001, the Circuit Court filed a Stipulated
 
Order in both cases, which stated in relevant part:
 
[T]he Defendant shall receive credit for time served since
he was taken into custody on April 29, 2000 at 2330 hours,
and he shall be released from custody on April 29, 2001 at
2330.
 
It is further agreed that Special Condition B of the
Judgment and Sentence filed on January 11, 2001 in the
above-entitled matters shall be amended to read as follows: 
You are committed to the custody of the Director of the
Department of Public Safety for a period of ONE (1) year of
jail confinement in [Case 2] Count 1, credit for time served
nunc pro tunc
 to April 29, 2000 at 2330 hours.
 
Spears was released on April 29, 2001. On May 8, 2001,
 
the Circuit Court filed an Amended Stipulated Order, which stated
 
in relevant part:
 
[T]he Defendant shall receive credit for time served since
he was taken into custody on April 29, 2000 at 2330 hours,
and he shall be released from custody on April 29, 2001 at
2330.
 
It is further agreed that Special Condition B of the
Judgment and Sentence filed on January 11, 2001 in the
above-entitled matters shall be amended to read, in full, as
follows:
 
You are committed to the custody of the Director of the
Department of Public Safety for a period of ONE (1) year of
jail confinement in [Case 2] Count 1 [credit for time served
nunc pro tunc to April 29, 2000 at 2330 hours],
2 and for a
 
period of ONE (1) year of jail confinement in [Case 1] Count
1; 30 days in Counts 2 and 5; all terms to run concurrently
with each count and each criminal number. Mittimus to issue
 forthwith with credit for time served.
 
On February 18, 2003, the State filed a motion for an
 
order to show cause and issuance of a warrant of arrest based on
 
alleged violations of the terms and conditions of Spears'
 
probation for Case 2. Spears was served with the warrant on May
 
16, 2006. On July 13, 2006, Spears admitted to violating certain
 
terms and conditions of his probation. The Circuit Court

 Brackets in original.
 
3
  
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
resentenced Spears in Case 2 by revoking his probation and
 
sentencing him to a five-year term of imprisonment, with credit
 
for time served. 
On July 3, 2008, Spears sent a letter to Scott Jinbo, 
the Hawai� i Department of Public Safety (DPS) Contract Monitor, 
in which Spears asserted that his release date from prison for 
Case 2 had been inaccurately calculated. Spears stated that he 
had been in custody since May 16, 2006 and that he should have 
received credit for time served from April 29, 2000 to April 29, 
3
2001  and from May 16, 2006 to July 13, 2006. 
On January 26, 2010, the Circuit Court filed a Notice
 
of 
Ex Parte Communication, which stated that it had received a
 
letter from Spears on January 25, 2010. In his letter, Spears
 
asked that the Circuit Court to clarify his presentence credits
 
for Case 2 to include the periods of his incarceration from April
 
29, 2000 to April 29, 2001 and from May 16, 2006 to July 13,
 
2006.4
 
On March 1, 2010, Spears filed a Motion to Withdraw
 
Guilty Plea in both cases, stating that the State had not honored
 
the plea agreement. On March 16, 2010, Spears filed a Motion for
 
Writ, asking the Circuit Court for an order allowing him to
 
appear before it for oral arguments on his Motion to Withdraw
 
Guilty Plea.
 
Spears sent a letter that he had received from DPS for
 
the Circuit Court to file for his upcoming April 20, 2010
 
hearing, which states, in relevant part:
 
When you were released on 4/29/01, you had not served the
full 1 year sentence that was imposed for the charge in
[Case 2]. Your expected end date for that case was 7/9/01.
 . . . Now that you have been re-sentenced to an open term
 
3
 Spears mistakenly wrote that he was incarcerated from April 26,
2000 to April 26, 2001. 
4
 Spears mistakenly wrote that he was incarcerated until July 12,
2006, but it appears that he was in custody until he was
resentenced to five years incarceration on July 13, 2006. 
4
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
in [Case 2], it is [DPS's] responsibility to compute your
pre-sentence credit. [DPS] is bound to follow HRS § 706-671,
which requires [DPS] to compute all detention that follows
the arrest for the charge for which the defendant is
sentenced. In review of our records, we have determined
that you had not served the full 1 year in 2001 for [Case
2]. . . . Pre-sentence credit is statutory and cannot be
nunc pro tunc. We have drafted a letter to the Judge,
requesting guidance in regards to the stipulated order that
was filed on 4/27/01. Until we receive documentation, or an
order to the contrary, your total pre-sentence credit for
[Case 2] will remain at 352 days, with a maximum expiration
date of 7/24/2010.
 
On April 20, 2010, at the hearing on Spears' Motion for
 
Writ and Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea, the Circuit Court orally
 
denied Spears' motion to withdraw guilty plea without prejudice,
 
indicating that Spears would not be able to withdraw his plea
 
5
under Hawai� i Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 32(d)  because
his motion was untimely, but that he could file an HRPP Rule 40 
petition. Thereafter, although it appears that Spears did not 
file a separate HRPP Rule 40 petition, the Circuit Court 
nevertheless appeared to treat Spears' Motion to Withdraw Guilty 
Plea as an HRPP Rule 40 petition, setting the matter for further 
hearing. 
On May 6, 2010, at a further hearing on Spears'
 
motion/petition, the Circuit Court recognized that "the
 
government decided to enter into a stipulated order concerning
 
jail confinement that allowed for [Spears] to be given credit for
 
5
 HRPP Rule 32(d), entitled "Withdrawal of Plea[,]" states:
 
A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere may be
made before sentence is imposed or imposition of sentence is
suspended; provided that, to correct manifest injustice the court,
upon a party's motion submitted no later than ten (10) days after
imposition of sentence, shall set aside the judgment of conviction
and permit the defendant to withdraw the plea. At any later time,
 
a defendant seeking to withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo
 
contendere may do so only by petition pursuant to Rule 40 of these
 rules and the court shall not set aside such a plea unless doing
so is necessary to correct manifest injustice.
 
(emphasis added.)

time served nunc pro tunc to April 29, 2000 ."  The Circuit Court
 
further stated:
 
The Court recognizes that it was -- there was a period of
time in the State of Hawai� i when defendants would enter 
into stipulated orders allowing for credit for time served
nunc pro tunc even if the defendant was not actually in
custody in the case. And this is one of those situations. 
However, [DPS] in light of the way that the law has
developed and the law -- the way the law has developed is
that you actually have to be in custody in order to get
credit for that time.
 
And nunc pro tunc orders that credit time that was not
 
actually served will not be recognized by [DPS]. So,
therein, lies the problem for [] Spears. Because [DPS] is
not going to recognize credit for time served that doesn't
reflect time served consistent with case law as has
 
developed in the State of Hawai� i. 
The Circuit Court further continued the hearing to June
 
8, 2010. 
On May 24, 2010, Spears filed a Notice of Appeal from
 
the Circuit Court's April 20, 2010 verbal denial of his Motion to
 
Withdraw Guilty Plea "to reserve his right thereof." 
On June 8, 2010, at the further hearing on Spears' 
motion/petition, the Circuit Court stated that under State v. 
March, 94 Hawai� i 250, 11 P.3d 1094 (2000), it did not have the 
authority to give Spears credit for time that he did not actually serve in Case 2, as it had in the April 27, 2001 Stipulated Order 
and May 8, 2001 Amended Stipulated Order. Accordingly, the 
Circuit Court "order[ed] that [the] order giving [Spears] credit 
for time that he didn't actually serve be vacated." 
On June 24, 2010, the Circuit Court filed the Sua
 
Sponte Order rescinding the April 27, 2001 Stipulated Order and
 
the May 8, 2001 Amended Stipulated Order. The Sua Sponte Order
 
provides, in its entirety:
 
On June 8, 2010, a further hearing on Defendant EVERETT
SPEARS' ("Defendant") motion for writ and motion to withdraw
guilty plea was held in [Case 1]. . . . During said
hearing, the Court observed that the stipulated order signed
by this Court granting Defendant credit for time served in
[Case 2] for time served only in [Case 1] was illegal and
ordered that said order be rescinded. The purpose of this
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
order is to reduce to writing the Court's oral order of June
8, 2010.
 
With the exception of the fact that the same defendant was
charged in both of the above cases, there is no dispute that
the charges in the two cases are unrelated. On April 27,
2001, the parties in the above matters entered into a
"stipulated order re: jail confinement" that provided that
Defendant be "committed to the custody of the Director of
the Department of Public Safety for a period of one (1) year
confinement in [Case 2] credit for time served nunc pro tunc
 
to April 29, 2000 at 2330 hours." On May 8, 2001, the
parties entered into an "amended stipulated order re: jail
confinement" that did not change the substance of the
stipulated order filed April 27, 2001.
 
It is undisputed that Defendant was not in custody in [Case
2] from April 29, 2000 through July 11, 2000. Indeed, in
[Case 2], Defendant was charged by indictment filed on July
3, 2000. He was arrested in [Case 2] on July 12, 2000.
During the period of April 29, 2000 through July 11, 2000,
Defendant was in custody in [Case 1] only. Thus, pursuant
to the stipulated orders filed April 27, 2001 and May 8,
2001, Defendant was given credit in [Case 2] for time served
only in [Case 1].
 
Although a sentencing court is given broad discretion in
sentencing defendants, the sentence imposed must be
authorized by statute. State v. March, 94 Hawai� i 250, 254,
11 P.3d 1094, 1098 (2000). Hawai� i Revised Statutes ("HRS")
§ 706-600 expressly precludes the imposition of a sentencenot authorized by chapter 706. Id. HRS § 706-671 not only
authorizes, but also mandates, that a trial court credit a
defendant for any time served in connection with the sameoffense. HRS § 706-671, however, does not authorize courtsto credit a defendant with time served for another offense. 
Id. at 254-55, 11 P.3d 1098-99. A sentence that credits a 
defendant with time served for an unrelated offense is illegal because the sentencing court is not authorized by
Chapter 706 to grant such a credit. Id. at 255, 11 P.3d at
1099. 
Here, by stipulated orders filed April 27, 2001 and May 8,
2001, Defendant was given credit in [Case 2] for time he had
served in [Case 1], an unrelated case. There is no dispute
that Defendant was not in custody in [Case 2] during the
period of April 29, 2000 through July 11, 2000. Thus, the
April 27, 2001 and May 8, 2001 stipulated orders that gave
credit to Defendant for time he had not actually served in
[Case 2] were illegal and should be rescinded. Now,
therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulated order re: jail
confinement, filed in the above matters on April 27, 2001, and the
amended stipulated order re: jail confinement, filed in the above
matters on May 8, 2001, are rescinded. Nothing in this order
shall preclude Defendant from pursuing the motions he has already
filed or may file in the above matters. Any such motions will be
heard and disposed of by separate order.

Spears' motion/petition, which the Circuit Court
 
continued to refer to as Spears' Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea,
 
was still pending when the Circuit Court filed its Sua Sponte
 
Order on June 24, 2010. On June 29, 2010, at a further hearing,
 
the Circuit Court stated that it would be appropriate to have an
 
evidentiary hearing. 
At 7:57 A.M. on July 27, 2010, the Circuit Court file-
stamped Spears' Ex-Parte Motion to Extend Time to File Notice of
 
Appeal (Motion to Extend Time), which the Circuit Court had
 
"approved and so ordered," so that Spears had until August 23,
 
2010 to file his Notice of Appeal. Spears' counsel had signed
 
and dated the Motion to Extend Time on July 26, 2010. 
On August 19, 2010, Spears submitted a Stipulation to
 
Extend Time in Which to File a Notice of Appeal (Stipulation)
 
from the June 24, 2010 Sua Sponte Order, asking that the deadline
 
for Spears to file a Notice of Appeal be extended to August 23,
 
2010, which states: "IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED by and between the
 
parties hereto, that the deadline to file a Notice of Appeal from
 
the Sua Sponte Order Rescinding Stipulated Order, which was filed
 
on June 24, 2010 is extended until August 23, 2010." The Circuit
 
Court approved the Stipulation. 
On August 23, 2010, Spears filed a Notice of Appeal
 
from the June 24, 2010 Sua Sponte Order.
 
On appeal, Spears raises two points of error, (1)
 
contending that the Circuit Court and State breached the plea
 agreement, and (2) the Circuit Court and State violated Spears'
 
due process rights because the June 24, 2010 Sua Sponte Order
 
rescinded Spears' agreed-upon award of preconfinement credit nunc
 pro tunc. In response, the State argues, inter alia, that this
 
court lacks appellate jurisdiction because the August 23, 2010
 
Notice of Appeal was untimely.
 
Upon careful review, we conclude that we lack
 
jurisdiction over this appeal, not for the reasons argued by the
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
State, but because the Sua Sponte Order is not a final appealable
 
order. 
"The right of appeal in a criminal case is purely 
statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or 
statutory provision." State v. Poohina, 97 Hawai� i 505, 509, 40 
P.3d 907, 911 (2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). "In a circuit court criminal case, a defendant may 
appeal from the judgment of the circuit court, see HRS § 641­
11
[ 6
] [Supp. 2011], from a certified interlocutory order, see HRS
§ 641-17 [Supp. 2011], or from an interlocutory order denying a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy." State v. Kealaiki, 
95 Hawai
�i 309, 312, 22 P.3d 588, 591 (2001) (citation omitted). 
Pursuant to HRS § 641-11 and "HRPP Rule 40(h), appeals from 
proceedings for post-conviction relief may be made from a 
judgment entered in the proceeding and must be taken in 
accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Hawai� i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP)." Grattafiori v. State, 79 Hawai� i 10, 13, 897 
P.2d 937, 940 (1995) (internal quotation marks and brackets 
omitted). 
Neither party raised the issue of whether the June 24,
 
2010 Sua Sponte Order is an appealable final order. 
Nevertheless, a "post-judgment order is appealable in its own
 
right only if it meets the test of finality applicable to all
 
judicial decisions." Familian Northwest, Inc. v. Cent. Pac.
 
Boiler & Piping, Ltd., 68 Haw. 368, 369, 714 P.2d 936, 937 (1986)
 (citation omitted). The nature and effect of the order controls
 
whether the order is final:
 
"Final order" means an order ending the proceedings, leaving
nothing further to be accomplished. Consequently, an order
is not final if the rights of a party involved remain
undetermined or if the matter is retained for further
 action.
 
6
 Under HRS § 641-11, "[a]ny party aggrieved by the judgment of a
circuit court in a criminal matter may appeal to the intermediate
appellate court," and the "judgment" of a circuit court is the
"sentence of the court in a criminal case[.]" HRS § 641-11.

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Familian Northwest, Inc., 68 Haw. at 369, 714 P.2d at 937
 
(citations omitted). "Procedural orders which leave the cause
 
still pending are ordinarily considered to be interlocutory." 
Jezierny v. Biggins, 56 Haw. 662, 663, 548 P.2d 251, 252 (1976).
 
Here, the Circuit Court has not yet entered a final
 
judgment on all of the arguments that Spears asserted in his
 
motion/petition, which we deem to be an HRPP Rule 40 petition, as
 
this appears to be most consistent with the Circuit Court's
 
treatment of it. The June 24, 2010 Sua Sponte Order is not a
 
final order because "the rights of a party involved remain
 
undetermined or [] the matter is retained for further action." 
Familian Northwest, Inc., 68 Haw. at 369, 714 P.2d at 937
 
(citations omitted). 
In Spears' March 1, 2010 motion/petition, Spears stated
 
that he wanted to "withdraw his guilty plea and go to trial on
 
the matters" because he was not awarded preconfinement credit
 
nunc pro tunc in Case 2 and thus "the plea agreement has not been
 
honored by the State[.]" While the Sua Sponte Order addresses
 
the issue of Spears' preconfinement credit, it does not address
 
the issue of whether the State breached the plea agreement, or
 
whether the State breached Spears' due process rights, as Spears
 
alleges.  The Sua Sponte Order simply rescinds the previous
 
stipulated orders from 2001, which granted Spears preconfinement
 
credit nunc pro tunc in Case 2.
 
In fact, Spears' motion/petition was still pending at
 
the time the Circuit Court filed its Sua Sponte Order on June 24,
 
2010. On June 29, 2010, the Circuit Court stated that it would
 
be appropriate to have an evidentiary hearing. The Sua Sponte
 
Order presumably refers to Spears' motion/petition, stating:
 
"Nothing in this order shall preclude Defendant from pursuing the
 
motions he has already filed or may file in the above matters. 
Any such motions will be heard and disposed of by separate
 
order." 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI �I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Absent an appealable final judgment that resolves all
 
of the issues in Spears' motion/petition for post-conviction
 
relief, Spears' appeal is premature and we lack jurisdiction. 
Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate
 
jurisdiction.
