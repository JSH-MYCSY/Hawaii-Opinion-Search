OPINION OF THE COURT BY GINOZA, J.

Sands of Kahana (AOAO) appeals from a Final Judgment filed on
 
August 17, 2010, in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit
 (circuit court).

 The Honorable Joel E. August presided.
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
The circuit court ruled in favor of Plaintiff-Appellee
 
William T. Vinson (Vinson) and against the AOAO. The Final
 
Judgment was granted in accordance with a January 13, 2010 "Order
 Granting Plaintiff William T. Vinson's Motion for Summary
 Judgment Filed on November 4, 2009, and Denying Defendant
 Association of Apartment Owners of Sands of Kahana's Cross-Motion
 for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Complaint" and an amended
 order filed on February 16, 2010 (Summary Judgment Orders). 
Also, the Final Judgment awarded Vinson attorneys' fees
 
and costs pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 514B-157(b)
 
2
(2006) in accordance with an "Order Granting Attorney's Fees and
Costs to Plaintiff" filed May 6, 2010 (Order Granting
 Fees/Costs). 
On appeal, the AOAO contends that the circuit court
 
erred when it: (1) concluded that HRS § 514B-153(e) (Supp. 2010)
3
 
required associations of apartment owners to maintain the names
 and current addresses of those who own a time share interest in
 apartment units (time share owners); (2) concluded that the term
 "member" of an association of apartment owners, as used in
 HRS § 514B-153(e), included time share owners; (3) concluded that
 HRS chapter 514E and HRS § 514B-153(h) did not exempt time share
 plans and time share owners from the requirements of HRS § 514B­153(e); and (4) awarded attorneys' fees and costs under HRS §
 514B-157(b), including allegedly awarding fees and costs to non-
parties over whom the court had no jurisdiction. 
2 HRS § 514B-157(b) provides in relevant part that "[i]f any claim by
an owner is substantiated in any action against an association . . . to
enforce any provision of the declaration, bylaws, house rules, or this
chapter, then all reasonable and necessary expenses, costs, and attorneys'
fees incurred by an owner shall be awarded to such owner; . . . ."
3
 In 2010, HRS § 514B-153(e) stated in pertinent part that "[t]he
managing agent, resident manager, or board shall keep an accurate and current
list of members of the association and their current addresses . . . . [A]
copy shall be available, at cost, to any member of the association as provided
in the declaration or bylaws or rules and regulations or, in any case, to any
member who furnishes to the managing agent or resident manager or the board a
duly executed and acknowledged affidavit . . . ."

 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
In his answering brief, Vinson asserts that this appeal
 
is moot because the AOAO provided a membership list to Vinson
 
that complied with the circuit court's order (compliant list). 
In its reply brief, the AOAO responds that the appeal
 
is not moot because the Final Judgment requires that the AOAO
 maintain a current list of individual time share owners, and thus
 the AOAO has an ongoing duty under the circuit court's judgment. 
The AOAO also argues that certain exceptions to mootness apply,
 including the collateral consequence that the Final Judgment in
 effect alters the property rights of owners by elevating time
 share owners to an equal status with unit owners. 
Several months after briefing was completed in this
 
appeal, the legislature amended HRS § 514B-153(e) through Act 98
 of the 2011 legislative session, such that the following language
 was added to the statute:
 
Where the condominium project or any units within the
project are subject to a time share plan under Chapter 514E,
the association shall only be required to maintain in its
records the name and address of the time share association
 as the representative agent for the individual time share
owners unless the association receives a request by a time
share owner to maintain in its records the name and address
 of the time share owner.
 
2011 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 98, § 1 at 258-59 (emphasis added). Act
 
98 was approved and took effect on June 9, 2011. On July 13,
 2011, we granted the AOAO's "Motion for Leave to File
 Supplemental Brief" to allow both parties to address Act 98. 
In its supplemental brief, the AOAO asserts that
 
despite Act 98, it is still subject to the circuit court's Final
 Judgment which requires the AOAO's continued performance under
 that judgment in contradiction to Act 98; that Act 98 does not
 relieve the AOAO of the expanded rights the AOAO asserts were
 given to time share owners via the Final Judgment; and the AOAO
 remains injured by the circuit court's award of attorneys' fees
 and costs. 
In his supplemental brief, Vinson argues that Act 98
 
has no effect on this appeal because it applies prospectively,
 not retroactively. However, Vinson still asserts that this case
 
3
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
is moot because, as argued in his answering brief, the AOAO has
 
already provided Vinson with the compliant list. 
For the reasons stated below, we conclude that:
 (1) the AOAO having provided the compliant list to
 
Vinson, combined with the passage of Act 98, has rendered the
 AOAO's appeal on the merits moot;
 
(2) to alleviate concerns regarding any collateral
 
effect the circuit court's statutory interpretation may have, we
 vacate (a) the summary judgment orders filed January 13, 2010,
 and February 16, 2010, and (b) the Final Judgment insofar as it
 addresses HRS § 514B-153;
 
(3) although the AOAO's appeal challenging the
 
interpretation of HRS § 514B-153 is moot, the question of
 attorneys' fees and costs awarded to Vinson is ancillary to the
 underlying proceeding and we may address the fees and costs award
 under our equitable jurisdiction; and 
(4) Vinson incurred only a part of the attorneys' fees
 
and costs awarded to him under HRS § 514B-157(b) and thus the
 circuit court's award is affirmed to the extent that it awarded
 attorneys' fees of $1,700, plus general excise tax on that
 amount, but the award of fees and costs beyond that amount is
 reversed.
 
I. Background
 
The basic facts of this case are not disputed. 
The AOAO is the condominium homeowners' association at
 
the Sands of Kahana (Sands), located on Maui. In total, there
 are 196 units at Sands, 144 of which are time share units. The
 other 52 units are either owned by individuals or small groups,
 and largely used as vacation or second homes (whole units). 
The time share units were purchased by Consolidated
 
Maui, Inc. and assigned into a time share plan owned and operated
 by the Sands of Kahana Vacation Club (Vacation Club), a non­profit corporation. Both parties agree that roughly 9,150 time
 share owners participate in this plan. 
4
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Vinson, as trustee of the Vinson Family Trust, owns a
 
whole unit at Sands, and is not a member of the time share plan. 
On or about April 10, 2007, Vinson requested a copy of the AOAO's
 membership list that included all time share owners individually,
 including their respective addresses, via "a duly executed and
 acknowledged affidavit" pursuant to HRS § 514B-153(e). Vinson
 alleges the AOAO declined to provide a list identifying
 individual time share owners. On October 17, 2007, Vinson filed
 a lawsuit against the AOAO in a prior case (Civ. No. 07-1­0420(1)) to obtain the list as requested. Subsequently, the
 parties pursued mediation and the case was dismissed without
 prejudice. 
After unsuccessful attempts at mediation, Vinson's
 
attorney, on his behalf, requested a copy of the AOAO's
 membership list, including time share owners, in a letter dated
 January 21, 2009. In a letter dated January 29, 2009, the AOAO
 stated that it did not believe it was required under HRS § 514B­153(e) to maintain a list of individual time share owners, and
 instead provided a list with the name and address of the Vacation
 Club for each time share unit. 
On February 3, 2009, Vinson filed the complaint for
 
declaratory judgment in this case seeking to have the AOAO
 provide an accurate and current list of its members and their
 addresses, including all time share owners individually, and also
 requesting an award of attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs
 incurred in the action. On November 5, 2009, Vinson filed a
 motion for summary judgment and on November 13, 2009, the AOAO
 filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On December 21, 2009,
 Vinson's counsel filed a "Declaration of William C. Byrns
 Regarding Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs." 
On January 13, 2010, the circuit court issued an order
 
granting Vinson's motion for summary judgment and denying the
 AOAO's cross-motion. In the order, the circuit court interpreted
 HRS § 514B-153 to require associations of apartment owners to
 maintain the names and current addresses of individual time share
 
5
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
owners. The circuit court further interpreted the term "current
 
addresses" to require the personal residential mailing addresses
 of each individual time share owner. On February 16, 2010, the
 circuit court amended its summary judgment order, redefining
 "current addresses" as "the mailing address of each unit or to
 any other mailing address designated in writing by the unit
 owner, consistent with HRS § 514B-121(c)(2)." 
On February 11, 2010, the AOAO filed a Notice of 
Appeal. On June 28, 2010, this court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the circuit court had not reduced the summary judgment order to a separate judgment that resolved all claims against all parties as required by Hawai' i Rules of 
Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 58 and Jenkins v. Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright, 76 Hawai' i 115, 869 P.2d 1334 (1994). 
On May 6, 2010, the circuit court filed the Order
 
Granting Fees/Costs, awarding to Vinson the amount of $29,589.65. 
On August 17, 2010, the circuit court reduced all orders to a
 separate, final judgment. The AOAO timely appealed.
 
On November 4, 2010, the circuit court issued an order
 
granting Vinson's motion to compel the AOAO to comply with the
 Final Judgment. Both parties agree that on or about January 3,
 2011, the AOAO provided a membership list of time share owners
 and their addresses. The circuit court determined that the list
 complied with the Final Judgment. 
On June 9, 2011, Act 98 was signed into law. 2011 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 98, § 1 at 258-59. As noted above, Act 98 amended
 HRS § 514B-153(e) so that associations for condominium projects
 must only maintain in its records the name and address of the
 time share association as the agent for the individual time share
 owners, unless the time share owner requests that the association
 maintain the name and address of the time share owner.

II. Discussion
 
A. Mootness
 
As stated in Wong v. Bd. of Regents, 62 Haw. 391, 616
 
P.2d 201 (1980):
 
The duty of this court, as of every other judicial tribunal,
is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be
carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot
questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles
or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in 
the case before it. 
Id. at 394-95, 616 P.2d at 204 (citations omitted). Further,
 
[i]t is well-settled that the mootness doctrine encompasses
the circumstances that destroy the justiciability of a case
previously suitable for determination. A case is moot where
 the question to be determined is abstract and does not rest
on existing facts or rights. Thus, the mootness doctrine is
properly invoked where 'events . . . have so affected the
relations between the parties that the two conditions for
justiciability relevant on appeal-adverse interest and
effective remedy-have been compromised.'
 
McCabe Hamilton & Renny Co. v. Chung, 98 Hawai' i 107, 116-17, 43 
P.3d 244, 253-54 (App. 2002) (quoting In re Thomas, 73 Haw. 223, 
225-26, 832 P.2d 253, 254 (1992)). 
Act 98 and the AOAO's provision of the compliant list
 
resolve all controversies regarding the AOAO's ongoing duties and
 Vinson's initial pursuit of declaratory judgment. There is no
 longer an adverse interest between the parties, nor any effective
 remedy that this court can provide. Therefore, we conclude that
 the relationship between the parties has been so affected as to
 compromise the justiciability of this matter. The appeal as to
 the merits is moot and we thus lack subject matter jurisdiction
 to review the circuit court's Summary Judgment Orders and the
 entry of Final Judgment based on the summary judgment ruling.
1. The Compliant List
 
Vinson argues that the AOAO's provision of the
 
compliant list renders this appeal moot. In this case, Vinson
 sought declaratory relief that the AOAO was required to provide a
 membership list which included the names and addresses of
 individuals who owned time share interests in the Vacation Club
 time share plan. Vinson asserted that access to such a list was
 
7
  
 
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
his right as a member of the AOAO under HRS § 514B-153(e), which
 
during the circuit court proceedings read in pertinent part:
 
(e) The managing agent, resident manager or board
shall keep an accurate and current list of members of the
association and their current addresses . . . . The list
 shall be maintained at a place designated by the board, and
a copy shall be available, at cost, to any member of the
association as provided in the declaration or bylaws or
rules and regulations or, in any case, to any member who
furnishes to the managing agent or resident manager or the
board a duly executed and acknowledged affidavit stating
that the list:
 
(1)	 Will be used by the owner personally and only
for the purpose of soliciting votes or proxies,
or for providing information to other owners
with respect to association matters; and
 
(2)	 Shall not be used by the owner or furnished to
anyone else for any other purpose.
 
As noted above, both parties agree that the AOAO has
 
provided a membership list containing the names of individual
 
time share owners and their address at the Sands. Also, both
 parties acknowledge that the circuit court declared this list
 complied with the court's Summary Judgment Orders and Final
 Judgment. Therefore, as Vinson expressly acknowledges, the
 relief he sought, procurement of a membership list that includes
 individual time share owners' names and addresses, has been
 accomplished. Cf. Wong, 62 Haw. at 396, 616 P.2d at 205 (holding
 
that a request for declaratory judgment was no longer viable
 because the appellee had complied with statutory requirements
 post appeal and there was "nothing left to grant appellant").
 
As asserted by the AOAO, however, the Summary Judgment
 
Orders and the Final Judgment require that the AOAO "maintain" a
 current membership list. To maintain means "[t]o continue
 (something)." Black's Law Dictionary 1039 (9th ed. 2009). 
Hence, the appeal related to the Summary Judgment Orders and
 resulting Final Judgment is not moot simply because the compliant
 list was provided.
 
Yet, the proffering of the list does contribute to
 
mooting this appeal. This court cannot "require something to be
 done which ha[s] already taken place[,]" nor can it "avoid an
 
8
  FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
event which ha[s] already passed beyond recall." McCabe Hamilton 
& Renny, 98 Hawai' i at 117, 43 P.3d at 254 (quoting Brownlow v. 
Schwartz, 261 U.S. 216, 217-18 (1923)). The AOAO has provided no persuasive or clear argument as to how its interest would be affected or how we could provide it with an effective remedy by reaching the merits, ruling for the AOAO, and even ordering the return of the list.
4 The AOAO has already compiled the list and 
provided it to Vinson. Therefore, the provision of the compliant list does affect the justiciability of this appeal, but it is not dispositive as to the requirement that the AOAO "maintain" a current list. 
2. Act 98
 
For different reasons, as noted above, the parties take
 
the position that Act 98 does not render the AOAO's appeal on the
 merits moot. We disagree and conclude that Act 98 moots the
 question of the AOAO's ongoing obligation to maintain a current
 list of time share owners. Act 98 makes clear that the AOAO's
 duty going forward is to maintain a list identifying only the
 time share association as the representative of the individual
 owners, not the individual owners themselves, unless otherwise
 specified by the time share owner.
 
To the extent the AOAO argues that the circuit court's
 
Summary Judgment Orders and Final Judgment would remain in effect
 absent our review of the merits, and thus bind the AOAO in direct
 contravention with Act 98, we have recognized in prior cases that
 the appropriate action is to vacate the unreviewed trial court
 judgment and direct dismissal of the case. Aircall of Haw., Inc.
 
v. Home Properties, Inc., 6 Haw. App. 593, 595, 733 P.2d 1231,
 1232 (1987); see also Exit Co. Ltd. P'ship v. Airlines Capital
 
4
 The AOAO requests return of the compliant list "plus any copies,
summaries or other documents, created with information derived from the list
of time share owners." The AOAO does not articulate its reasons, but is
apparently concerned about improper solicitations of the time share owners,
where their names are conveniently contained on the list. The AOAO's asserted
 concern does not indicate how the AOAO's interest is affected. Moreover, the
AOAO's stated concern is merely conjecture.
 
9
   FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Corp., 7 Haw. App. 363, 366, 766 P.2d 129, 131 (1988). In this
 
case, vacating the Summary Judgment Orders and the Final Judgment
 to the extent that they interpret HRS § 514B-153 will alleviate
 any concerns by the AOAO that they have an ongoing obligation
 under these circuit court rulings, as well as their concern that
 these rulings have somehow elevated the rights of time share
 owners in an expansive manner.
 
We further address the AOAO's concern that its appeal 
should not be deemed moot because the circuit court improperly awarded attorneys' fees and costs to Vinson. In Queen Emma Found. v. Tatibouet, 123 Hawai' i 500, 236 P.3d 1236 (App. 2010), 
this court adopted the approach that, although the merits of the case on appeal may be moot, issues related to attorneys' fees and costs are still reviewable. 
[A]lthough a claim for attorney's fees does not preserve a
case which has otherwise become moot on appeal, . . . the
question of attorney's fees is ancillary to the underlying
action and survives independently under the Court's
equitable jurisdiction. Where the underlying controversy
has become moot, there is no right to review or redetermine
any of the issues in the underlying action solely for the
purpose of deciding the attorney's fees question. Instead,
the question of attorney's fees and costs must be decided
based on whether the recipient of the attorney's fees and
costs award can be considered to be the prevailing party in
the underlying action, without regard to whether we think
the trial court's decision on the underlying merits is
correct.
 
123 Haw. at 510, 236 P.3d at 1246 (citations, internal quotation
 
marks and brackets omitted); see also Bishop v. Committee on
 Prof'l Ethics and Conduct of the Iowa State Bar Ass'n, 686 F.2d
 1278, 1290 (8th Cir. 1982) ("[I]t has been generally held that
 the dismissal on appeal of the underlying claims on the merits on
 the grounds of mootness is neither precluded by an award of
 attorney's fees, nor does such a dismissal preclude an award of
 attorney's fees."); Bagby v. Beal, 606 F.2d 411 (3rd Cir. 1979)
 (ruling that appeal was moot, vacating judgment of district
 court, remanding with instructions to dismiss, and affirming
 district court's award of attorney's fees). Therefore, the
 AOAO's appeal from the circuit court's award of attorneys' fees
 
10
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
and costs does not preserve review of the underlying merits, but
 
we will review the fees and costs award pursuant to Tatibouet.
 
B. Attorneys' Fees and Costs
 
Pursuant to HRS § 514B-157(b), the circuit court
 
granted Vinson attorneys' fees and costs, plus general excise
 
tax, in the total amount of $29,589.65. HRS § 514B-157(b)
 provides in relevant part that "[i]f any claim by an owner is
 substantiated in any action against an association . . . to
 enforce any provision of . . . this chapter, then all reasonable
 and necessary expenses, costs, and attorneys' fees incurred by an
 owner shall be awarded to such owner[.]"
 
The AOAO challenges the circuit court's award of
 
attorneys' fees and costs on two grounds. First, the AOAO
 asserts that Vinson's primary claim was for declaratory relief,
 which seeks to establish rights rather than enforce rights as
 required under HRS § 514B-157(b). Second, the AOAO contends that
 Vinson did not "incur" attorneys' fees or costs as required under
 HRS § 514B-157(b) because the requested fees and costs were
 billed to and paid, at least in part, by others who were not
 party to the case and Vinson made no showing that he was
 obligated to pay the fees and costs.
 
Pursuant to Tatibouet, we must determine if Vinson
 
prevailed and is entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and
 costs given the outcome in the circuit court, without regard to
 whether we think the circuit court's decision on the underlying
 merits is correct. 123 Haw. at 510, 236 P.3d at 1246.
 
Additionally, "[t]he trial court's grant or denial of 
attorney's fees and costs is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard." Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 120 
Hawai'i 181, 197, 202 P.3d 1226, 1242 (2009) (citations, internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
The trial court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling
on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous
assessment of the evidence. In other words, an abuse of
discretion occurs where the trial court has clearly exceeded
the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of
 
11
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party
litigant. 
Maui Tomorrow v. State of Haw., Bd. of Land & Natural Res., 110 
Hawai'i 234, 242, 131 P.3d 517, 525 (2006) (citations, internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted). 
With regard to the AOAO's first argument, it is clear
 
to us that Vinson's action was one to enforce a provision of HRS
 chapter 514B, specifically HRS § 514B-153(e). The AOAO's
 challenge in this regard is therefore without merit. Further,
 considering the requirements under HRS § 514B-157(b) for the
 award of attorneys' fees and costs, it is undisputed that Vinson
 is an owner and that his claim against the AOAO was substantiated
 by the circuit court's rulings.
 
The only serious question as to Vinson's entitlement to
 
fees and costs under HRS § 514B-157(b) is thus whether Vinson
 "incurred" the fees and costs awarded by the circuit court within
 the meaning of HRS § 514B-157(b). In this case, the firm of
 MacDonald Rudy Byrns O'Neill & Yamauchi (MacDonald firm)
 represented Vinson. However, as the circuit court determined and
 as the record reflects, all billing invoices by the MacDonald
 firm were addressed to an entity named Sullivan Properties; there
 are no engagement letters or agreements between Vinson, Sullivan
 Properties or the MacDonald firm; and Vinson has paid only $1,700
 of the requested fees. These facts are unchallenged. In a
 declaration dated April 8, 2010, Vinson attests, in relevant
 part, that:
 
3.	 To date I have personally paid $1,700 of attorney's fees in
this matter.
 
4.	 The balance of the attorney's fees have been paid via
contributions of other whole unit owners in the Sands of
 Kahana.
 
5.	 I do not have a written agreement with any of the other
whole unit owners regarding payment of the attorney's fees.
6.	 My understanding is the other whole unit owners are
contributing to the fees in this matter because they share
my concerns about Consolidated Resort's control of our
project.
7.	 Promptly upon the receipt of any attorney's fees awarded in
this matter I will distribute such award, on a pro rata
basis, to all contributing whole unit owners.
 
12
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
The circuit court ultimately concluded that, although no formal
 
retainer agreement exists between Vinson and the MacDonald firm,
 the MacDonald firm could sue Vinson in quantum meruit or quasi-
contract for services rendered if the fees and costs were not
 paid by the third parties. The circuit court thus awarded the
 challenged fees and costs.
 
Given these circumstances, we must determine whether
 
Vinson "incurred" the attorneys' fees and costs awarded by the
 circuit court, as required by HRS § 514B-157(b).
 
When construing a statute, our foremost obligation is
to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the
legislature, which is to be obtained primarily from
the language contained in the statute itself. And we
 must read statutory language in the context of the
entire statute and construe it in a manner consistent
 with its purpose.
 
When there is doubt, doubleness of meaning, or
indistinctiveness or uncertainty of an expression used
in a statute, an ambiguity exists. . . .
 
In construing an ambiguous statute, the meaning of the
ambiguous words may be sought by examining the context
with which the ambiguous words, phrases, and sentences
may be compared, in order to ascertain their true
meaning. Moreover, the courts may resort to extrinsic
aids in determining legislative intent. One avenue is
 the use of legislative history as an interpretive
tool.
 
[The appellate] court may also consider the reason and
spirit of the law, and the cause which induced the
legislature to enact it . . . to discover its true meaning.
 
Morgan v. Planning Dep't, 104 Hawai' i 173, 179-80, 86 P.3d 982, 
988-89 (2004) (citation omitted). 
The term "incurred" is not defined in HRS § 514B-157(b)
 
or elsewhere in HRS chapter 514B. Vinson argues that HRS § 514B­
157(b) states that fees and costs incurred "shall" be awarded and
 therefore an award of fees and costs is mandated. Vinson's
 argument, however, ignores the requirement in the statute that
 the fees and costs be "incurred."
 
Black's Law Dictionary defines "incur" to mean "to
 
suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense)." Black's
 
Law Dictionary 836 (9th ed. 2009). Yet, it is still unclear
 whether one can "incur" attorneys' fees and costs for purposes of
 
13
 FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
this particular statute, when a third party finances the legal
 
representation.
 
There is nothing in the context of HRS Chapter 514B
 
that suggests how we should interpret the term "incurred" in this
 case. Generally speaking, HRS § 514B-157 entitles both
 associations and owners to obtain reasonable attorneys' fees and
 costs incurred for inter alia substantiating claims to enforce
 HRS chapter 514B. Because the statute is ambiguous as to whether
 Vinson "incurred" the attorneys' fees and costs awarded by the
 circuit court, we thus consider the legislative history of
 HRS § 514B-157. However, the legislative history does not assist
 us in clarifying the definition of "incurred".

We therefore turn to existing Hawai' i case law that 
generally considered whether attorneys' fees should be awarded where a question was raised whether such fees had been incurred. In Wiginton v. Pac. Credit Corporation, 2 Haw. App. 435, 634 P.2d 111 (1981), the plaintiff, represented by the Legal Aid Society of Hawai' i (LASH), brought claims for unfair and deceptive 
practices and asserted that he was entitled to attorneys' fees under HRS § 480-13 (1976), which allowed for reasonable attorneys' fees to a prevailing plaintiff. Id. at 439-40, 446, 
634 P.2d at 115-16, 120. The defendant argued that because plaintiff was represented by LASH, the plaintiff had not incurred attorneys' fees and would thus be unjustly enriched. This court ruled that the plaintiff should not receive a windfall, but that if the plaintiff could show that he was "legally obligated" to 
5 The Legislature enacted HRS § 514B-157 in 2004 as part of a
comprehensive recodification of Hawaii's "Condominium Property Regime" Law
(which prior to 1988 was referred to as "Horizontal Property Regimes"). See
 
2004 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 164, §§ 1 at 755, 2 at 795-96; 1988 Haw. Sess Laws
Act 65, § 1 at 98. The predecessor to HRS § 514B-157 is HRS § 514A-94 (Supp.
1977), which in turn was preceded by HRS § 514-7.5 (1976). See 1977 Haw.
 
Sess. Laws Act 98, §2 at 180-81; 1976 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 239, § 1 at 757-58.
The statute has been amended over time, including the adoption of subsection
(b) in 1983. See 1983 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 137, § 1 at 250. The word
 
"incurred" has been a part of the statute since its original adoption in 1976.
See HRS § 514-7.5. However, there is nothing in the legislative history which
illuminates the question of how we should interpret "incurred" in subsection
(b) given the circumstances in this case.

pay LASH the fees that were recovered, then attorneys' fees could
 
be awarded. Id. at 446-47, 634 P.2d at 120; see also Morrison v.
 
Comm'r, 565 F.3d 658 (9th Cir. 2009).
 
We therefore hold that in order for Vinson to have
 
"incurred" attorneys' fees and costs under HRS § 514B-157(b), he
 must have paid or be legally obligated to pay such fees and costs
 to the MacDonald firm. In this case, based on the undisputed
 record, Vinson paid only $1,700 in fees; he has no agreement with
 the MacDonald firm contractually binding him to pay fees and
 costs; and, although Vinson attests that he would share fees
 awarded to him pro rata with contributing whole unit owners, he
 has no agreement with the third parties legally obligating him to
 repay them for the amounts they have paid or will pay. Moreover,
 the billing statements by the MacDonald firm were addressed to
 Sullivan Properties –- not Vinson –- and the billing entries
 indicate a variety of communications by the attorneys with
 individuals other than Vinson. We thus conclude that the circuit
 court based its award of attorneys' fees and costs on an
 erroneous view of the law when it determined that Vinson would
 prevail on a quantum meruit claim and thus was entitled to fees
 and costs. Such a conclusion is speculative on this record and
 Vinson, as the party requesting the award of fees and costs,
 failed to demonstrate his entitlement to such fees and costs
 beyond the $1,700 he has paid.
 
The circuit court thus abused its discretion to the
 
extent it awarded Vinson attorneys' fees and costs beyond $1,700
 and the general excise tax thereon.
III. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the following orders and
 
judgments entered by the circuit court are hereby vacated:
 
1)
 the portions of the Final Judgment filed on
 
August 17, 2010, pertaining to summary judgment and HRS § 514B­
153;
 
2) the January 13, 2010 summary judgment order; and
 
3) the February 16, 2010 summary judgment order.

The Final Judgment as it pertains to attorneys' fees
 
and costs and the "Order Granting Attorney's Fees and Costs to
 
Plaintiff" filed on May 6, 2010, are affirmed to the extent that
 they awarded attorneys' fees to Vinson in the amount of $1,700,
 plus the general excise tax on that amount. The award of fees
 and costs beyond that amount is reversed.
 
The case is remanded to the circuit court with
 
instructions to dismiss the case.
