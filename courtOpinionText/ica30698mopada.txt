by the Circuit Court on July 30, 2010. We affirm.
 
I. Background
 
A. Complaint
 Miller filed the Complaint on July 10, 2009, alleging
 
as follows: 
Miller resides at 45-002 Kuhonu Place in Kâne' ohe 
("Property"). BONY Mellon functions as a trustee for CWMBS, Inc.
 
("CWMBS"), which "issued securities . . . in the form of either
 collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) or collateralized debt
 obligations (CDOs) or other form of exotic investment vehicle
 . . . ." 
On or about March 1, 2006, Miller entered into a
 
residential mortgage loan agreement with Countrywide Home Loans,
 Inc. ("Countrywide"). On or about May 19, 2009, Miller received
 a Notice of Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose Under Power of
 Sale ("MERS Notice"), which claimed that the Property was
 scheduled to be sold at a public auction on July 17, 2009. The
 MERS Notice claimed that MERS was the nominee of BONY Mellon and,
 as mortgagee, was instituting the sale of the Property. 
Miller claimed that her mortgage 
was sold, in parsed fashion by the original lender
(Countrywide), for the purpose of . . . serving as
collateral for and being assigned to one or more tranches
within a special or exotic investment vehicle (SIV) known as
a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), collateralized
debt obligation (CDO), or other form of mortgage-backed
security (MBS) and/or for the purpose of being assigned to
one or more credit default swaps (CDS). The securitized
 loan trust into which [Miller's] loan was placed is, on
information and belief, collateralized by, inter alia,
hundreds if not thousands of other mortgage obligations
which have been assigned to one or more tranches within the
SIV in addition to other collateral. Further on information
 and belief, the interest in [Miller's] mortgage loan is or
may be owned by the unnamed certificateholders of the SIV.
 
She further alleged:
 
The securitized trust into which [Miller's] mortgage
loan was placed is required, as a matter of Federal law, to
be protected with various forms of credit enhancements or
insurances which insure against the risk of borrower
default, the premiums of which are paid at least in part by
the borrower and with no recourse against the borrower even
upon default. As such, there may not be any default which
would give rise to a foreclosure action and sale, as
[Miller's] loan obligation may have been liquidated in whole
or in part through the payment of benefits through one or
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
more of the credit enhancements available to the securitized
 
mortgage loan trust.
 
Miller also alleged that Defendants failed to engage in good-
faith loss-mitigation efforts with her prior to foreclosing,
 thereby precluding foreclosure; the MERS Notice fails to comply
 with Hawaii Revised Statutes ("HRS") § 667-5 because any sale
 scheduled must be made by a party "with authority by the power to
 act"; MERS's attempt to foreclose violated its contract with its
 servicers; and, due to the severance of ownership and possession
 of the Note and Mortgage, "Defendants are legally precluded from
 foreclosing on the Property unless and until they can demonstrate
 full legal standing to do so." 
The Complaint asserted two claims, seeking (1)
 
emergency temporary and permanent injunctive relief to halt the
 foreclosure process and (2) a declaration that Defendants do not
 have rights or standing to foreclose on the Property.
2
 
B. Motion for Summary Judgment
 
Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment ("MSJ")
 
on April 19, 2010. Defendants argued that there was no dispute
 
that Miller "borrowed money to purchase the subject property and
 has not made any payments in over a year." Defendants further
 argued that "it is undisputable that [BONY Mellon] holds the
 subject promissory note and mortgage and, therefore, has the
 right to foreclose on the subject property." In support of the
 MSJ, Defendants filed the Declaration of Kevin A. Durham,
 executed in San Diego, California, in which the declarant
 ("Durham") claimed to be a "duly authorized agent" for both BONY
 Mellon and MERS. 
In opposition, Miller first argued that Defendants
 
3
violated HRS § 667-5.7  because the Notice "required successful
2
 The parties later stipulated that the public sale scheduled for
July 17, 2009, pursuant to the MERS Notice, would be postponed until the trial
court disposed of Plaintiff's motion for temporary restraining order as to the
July 17, 2009 sale on the merits. 
3
 When this case was pending before the trial court, HRS § 667-5.7
stated:
 
(continued...)

  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
bidders to place as a downpayment their entire purchase price 'no
 
later than the 21st day following sale [auction]' with closing in
 thirty days . . . ." The MERS Notice states: "At the close of
 the auction, Purchaser shall pay at least 10% of the highest
 successful bid price ('Bid') in cash, or by cashier's or
 certified check; provided, however, that Mortgagee may submit a
 credit bid up to the amount of the secured indebtedness[.]" The
 MERS Notice also states: "The property shall be conveyed by
 Mortgagee by mortgagee's quitclaim conveyance, provided by
 Mortgagee, within 30 days after the auction and upon performance
 by Purchaser, no later than 21 days after the auction, of the
 following obligations: (a) . . . purchaser shall to deliver to
 Max Default Services Corporation, 43180 Business Park Drive,
 Suite 100, Temecula, CA 92590 a cashier's check for the remaining
 balance of the bid price, no later than the 21st day following
 sale . . . ." 
Second, Miller argued that Defendants violated HRS
 
4
§ 667-5  because MERS has no standing to foreclose.  The MERS
 
Notice, dated May 18, 2009, states that MERS, as mortgagee, would
 hold a public auction on July 17, 2009. 
3(...continued)
 
At any public sale pursuant to section 667-5, the
successful bidder at the public sale, as the purchaser,
shall not be required to make a downpayment to the
foreclosing mortgagee of more than ten per cent of the
highest successful bid price.
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 667-5.7 (Supp. 2011). HRS § 667-5.7 has since been repealed.
See 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 182, § 51 at 684.
 
4
 When this case was pending before the trial court, HRS § 667-5(a)
stated, in pertinent part:
 
When a power of sale is contained in a mortgage, and
where the mortgagee, the mortgagee's successor in interest,
or any person authorized by the power to act in the
premises, desires to foreclose under power of sale upon
breach of a condition of the mortgage, the mortgagee,
successor, or person shall be represented by an attorney who
is licensed to practice law in the State and is physically
located in the State. . . .
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 667-5 (Supp. 2010) (repealed 2012). See 2012 Haw. Sess. Laws
 
Act 182, § 50 at 684.
 
4
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Finally, Miller argued that Defendants violated HRS
 
5
§ 502-42;  and that the MERS Notice and two assignments of
mortgage were not properly notarized because they were signed and
 
executed by Durham, who claimed to be Assistant Secretary of MERS
 but, she alleges, was actually employed exclusively by Max
 Default Services Corp. 
While Miller presents evidence that
 
Durham signed the MERS Notice and the assignments as "Assistant
 Secretary," she presents no other evidence about Durham.
 
In reply, Defendants argued that (1) HRS § 667-5.7 only
 
applies to the down payment; (2) BONY Mellon had subsequently
 filed a Notice of Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose Under Power
 of Sale, filed by BONY Mellon as mortgagee ("BONY Mellon
 
6
Notice"),  and therefore, the issue concerning the MERS Notice
was moot; and (3) Miller failed to present any evidence that
 Durham lacked authority to act as Defendants' agent. 
C.	 Findings of fact, conclusions of law, Order and
Judgment
 
On July 30, 2010, the Circuit Court filed the "Findings
 
of Fact and Conclusions of Law; Order Granting Defendants [BONY
 
Mellon] and [MERS's] Motion for Summary Judgment". 
The Circuit
 
Court issued the following findings of fact:
 
1. [Miller] executed an Interest Only Fixed Rate
Note, dated March 1, 2006, in the principal amount of
$900,000.00 ("Note"). The Note was endorsed in blank by the
original holder of the Note, [Countrywide], and is currently
held by Defendant [BONY Mellon].
 
2. The Note is secured by a mortgage executed by
[Miller] and dated March 1, 2006, in favor of MERS, as
 
5	 HRS § 502-42 states in pertinent part:
 
The certificate of acknowledgment shall state in
substance that the person who executed the instrument
appeared before the officer granting the certificate and
acknowledged or stated that the person executed the same,
and that such person was personally known to the officer
granting such certificate to be the person whose name is
subscribed to the instrument as a party thereto, or was
proved to be such by the oath or affirmation of a credible
witness known to the officer whose name shall be inserted in
 the certificate.
 
H
AW. REV. STAT. § 502-42 (2006).
 
6
 Durham also executed the BONY Mellon Notice. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
nominee for [Countrywide] ("Mortgage").
 
3. Consequently, [Miller] is the Obligor under the
Note, and the Mortgagor under the Mortgage.
 
. . . .
 
6. An Assignment of Mortgage, dated May 18, 2009,
transferred the Mortgage from (i) Defendant MERS, as nominee
for [Countrywide], to (ii) MERS, as nominee for [BONY
Mellon] ("First Assignment"). . . .
 
7. A second Assignment of Mortgage, dated July 16,
2009, transferred the Mortgage from (i) MERS, as nominee for
[BONY Mellon] to (ii) [BONY Mellon] ("Second
Assignment"). . . .
 
8. As a result of the endorsement of the Note and the
 
assignments of the Mortgage described above, Defendant [BONY
Mellon] is the current holder of the Note and Mortgage.
 
9. Defendant MERS has had no interest in the Mortgage
since July 17, 2009, and has never had any interest in the
Note.
 
10. [Miller] has not made any payments owed under the
Note and Mortgage since January 30, 2009.
 
. . . .
 
13. Because of [Miller's] failure to pay the amounts
owed under the Note and Mortgage, Defendants commenced a
non-judicial foreclosure action against [Miller] on or about
May 18, 2009.
 
14. A revised Notice of Mortgagee's Intention to
Foreclose Under Power of Sale [BONY Mellon Notice] was
recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances, State of Hawaii, on
February 24, 2010 . . . . The [BONY Mellon Notice] was
served upon [Miller] by Defendant [BONY Mellon] on the same
date.
 
15. Through the [BONY Mellon Notice], Defendant [BONY
Mellon] has given adequate notice to [Miller] of its
intention to foreclose and has otherwise complied with the
requirements of [HRS] §§ 667-5, 5.5, and 5.7.
 
16. By reason of the facts hereinbefore set forth and
alleged, Defendant [BONY Mellon] is entitled to the
foreclosure of its Mortgage and the sale of the Property.
 
The Circuit Court, therefore, granted summary judgment in favor
 
of Defendants. 
The Circuit Court entered judgment in favor of
 
Defendants as to all claims on July 30, 2010. This appeal
 followed. 
II. Points of Error
 
Miller contends that the Circuit Court erred when it
 
granted summary judgement because:
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
A. "Requiring the full purchase price as a down payment
 
prior to actual closing violates [HRS § 667-5.7], [thereby]
 
rendering [the] nonjudicial foreclosure null and void . . . ." 
B. "Allowing MERS . . . to invoke a power of sale . . . and
 
to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure sale violates [HRS § 667­5(a)], [thereby] rendering [the] nonjudicial foreclosure null and
 void . . . ." 
C. Allowing notarization and recordation of certain
 
documents that "contain[ed] false descriptions of mortgagees and
 false statements of the capacities of signatories . . .
 render[ed] [those] fraudulent recordations null and void . . . ." 
III. Standards of Review
 
Summary judgment
 
"This court reviews a trial court's grant of summary
 
judgment de novo." Kamaka v. Goodsill Anderson Quinn & Stifel,
 
117 Hawai' i 92, 104, 176 P.3d 91, 103 (2008). 
Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,
depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on
file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, [this court] must view
all of the evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in
 the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.

Statutory interpretation
 
"The interpretation of a statute is a question of law
 
reviewable de novo." Garcia v. Kaiser Found. Hosps., 90 Hawai' i 
425, 430, 978 P.2d 863, 868 (1999).
 
IV.	 Discussion
 
A.	 HRS § 667-5.7 does not concern the payment of a final
purchase price7
 
7
 As noted above, see supra note 3, HRS § 667-5.7 was repealed in
2012, after the filing of the Judgment. The repeal of HRS § 667-5.7, however,
(continued...)
 
7
      NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
Miller argues that requiring the successful bidder at a
 
public sale to the pay the full purchase price prior to closing
 
violates HRS § 667-5.7.  We disagree.
 
HRS § 667-5.7 stated:
 
At any public sale pursuant to section 667-5, the
successful bidder at the public sale, as the purchaser,
shall not be required to make a downpayment to the
foreclosing mortgagee of more than ten per cent of the
highest successful bid price.
 
HAW. REV. STAT. § 667-5.7. The plain language of the statute 
clearly limits its applicability to downpayments made at the time 
the property is sold at the public sale. See Saiki v. LaSalle 
Bank Nat'l Ass'n as Trustee for Structured Asset Inv. Loan Trust Series 2003-BC2, Civ. No. 10-00085 JMS/LEK, 2011 WL 601139, at *5–6 (D. Haw. Feb. 10, 2011) (HRS § 667-5.7 does not control in what manner a public-sale seller may demand full and final payment following a public sale.). As the plain language of the statute is clear, "we are not at liberty to look beyond that language for a different meaning." See Bhakta v. Cnty. of Maui, 
109 Hawai' i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 (2005). 
Thus, contrary to Miller's argument, neither the MERS
 
Notice nor the BONY Mellon Notice violates HRS § 667-5.7. The
 notices require the winning bidder to pay at least ten percent of
 the purchase price "[a]t the close of auction" and the full
 purchase price "no later than the 21st day following the sale." 
The notices do not require the payment of more than ten percent
 of the purchase price at the time of the sale. Under the facts
 of this case, the notices do not violate HRS § 667-5.7.
 
B. Miller's argument concerning the MERS Notice is moot
 
Miller argues that MERS lacked standing to invoke the
 
7(...continued)
 
does not affect our posture on appeal. Pursuant to HRS § 1-10, "[t]he repeal
of any law shall not affect any act done, or any right accruing, accrued,
acquired, or established, or any suit or proceedings had or commenced in any
 civil case, before the time when the repeal takes effect." H
AW. REV. STAT. § 1­
10 (2009) (emphasis added); Graham Constr. Supply, Inc. v. Schrader Constr.,
 Inc., 63 Haw. 540, 544 n.6, 632 P.2d 649, 651 n.6 (1981) (recognizing HRS § 1­
10 as a "general saving statute"). Because Miller commenced her civil suit,
and BONY Mellon filed the BONY Mellon Notice, before the repeal of HRS § 667­5.7, the repeal of the statute does not affect this appeal.

power of sale provided for in the mortgage. It is undisputed,
 
though, that on July 16, 2009, MERS, as nominee for BONY Mellon,
 assigned the mortgage to BONY Mellon and that BONY Mellon, in its
 capacity as mortgagee, filed the BONY Mellon Notice with the
 Bureau of Conveyances on February 24, 2010. Because MERS no
 longer claims to be the mortgagee and is no longer seeking to
 foreclose, Miller's argument is moot. See City Bank v. Saje
 
Ventures II, 7 Haw. App. 130, 134, 748 P.2d 812, 815 (1988)
 (ruling that an issue is moot "if the reviewing court can no
 longer grant effective relief" (quoting United States v. Oregon,
 718 F.2d 299, 302 (9th Cir. 1983)).
 
C.	 Miller fails to show that Durham's various filings
contain false descriptions of the capacity of the
signatory
 
Miller claims that Durham "robo signed" various
 
documents even though he had "no personal knowledge whatsoever as
 
to what he was swearing to, . . . ." However, a party opposing a
 motion for summary judgment "must set forth specific facts
 showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Haw. R. Civ.
 P. 56(e). The nonmoving party cannot rely on "general allegations" to defeat summary judgment. Ralson v. Yim, 129 
Hawai'i 46, 56–57, 292 P.3d 1276, 1286–87 (2013). 
Miller presented no evidence below concerning Durham's 
capacity to sign the assignments or the notices. Miller's bald allegation in her memorandum in opposition to the MSJ that Durham "works exclusively for Max Default Services Corp." does not impeach Durham's competency. See Leis Family Ltd. P'ship v. 
Silversword Eng'g, 126 Hawai' i 532, 534 n.2, 273 P.3d 1218, 1220 
n.2 (App. 2012) ("[A]rgument of counsel in a memorandum of law
 . . . is not evidence (quoting Thomas v. Burlington Indus., Inc.
 769 F. Supp. 368, 369 (S.D. Fla. 1991)). Thus, Miller has not
 shown error.

 Miller argues for the first time on appeal that "there is no such

Appellee 'Bank of New York As Trustee For the Certificate-Holders Of CWMBS,
Inc., CHL Mortgage Pass-Through Trust 2006-8 Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2006-8[.]" Miller invited BONY Mellon to "show its

If Miller has a valid complaint in this regard, she should properly raise the

fraud upon the court. See Haw. R. Civ. P. 60(b), (b)(3), (b)(6).
