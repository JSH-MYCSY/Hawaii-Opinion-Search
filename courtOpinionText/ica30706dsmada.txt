NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
On August 31, 2010, Plaintiffs-Appellants Louise F. Lee
 
and Ida P. Peppers (Appellants) filed a notice of appeal. The
 
record on appeal was filed on October 25, 2010. Appellants did
 not file a statement of jurisdiction. On December 6, 2010,
 Appellants moved for a ninety-day extension of time to file the
 opening brief because the parties were settling this case as well
 as other related cases and they needed time to work out the terms
 and complete a settlement. This court granted the motion and
 extended the opening brief due date to March 10, 2011. 
Appellants did not file the opening brief on March 10, 2010.
 
On April 25, 2011, Appellants filed this stipulation of 
dismissal with prejudice of all claims pursuant to Hawai' i Rules 
of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 42(b) with the parties to bear their own costs, sanctions, and attorneys’ fees. HRAP Rule 42(b) governs stipulations for dismissal of appeals, and we conclude the parties are submitting this stipulation to dismiss the appeal and we construe this document as a stipulation to dismiss the appeal. Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the stipulation is approved,
 
and this appeal is dismissed with the parties to bear their own
 appellate costs and attorney’s fees. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, May 27, 2011.
