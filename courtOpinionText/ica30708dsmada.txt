IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI 'I
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT

AMBROSE S. FERNANDEZ, JR., Defendant-Appellant
 
(CIVIL NO. 1RC09-1-0274)

 
ORDER GRANTING FEBRUARY 11, 2011 MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL
(By: Nakamura, Chief Judge, Leonard and Ginoza, JJ.)

 
Upon review of (1) Plaintiffs/Counterclaim-Defendants/
 
Appellees Shawn Fernandez and Suzette Fernandez (the Appellees)
 
February 11, 2011 motion to dismiss Defendant/ Counterclaim-
Plaintiff/Appellant Ambrose Fernandez's (Appellant Ambrose
 Fernandez) appeal from the Honorable Christopher P. McKenzie's
 June 10, 2009 "Order Granting Plaintiffs' Oral Motion for
 Dismissal of Plaintiffs' Complaint with Prejudice" (the June 10,
 2009 order dismissing the Appellees' complaint), (2) Appellant
 Ambrose Fernandez's February 22, 2011 "Reconsideration Motion to
 Dismiss Appeal," which we deem to be a memorandum in opposition
 to the Appellees' February 11, 2011 motion to dismiss, and

(3) the record, it appears that we do not have jurisdiction over
 
this appeal because Appellant Ambrose Fernandez's appeal is
 
untimely under Rule 4(a)(1) of the Hawai 'i Rules of Appellate 
Procedure (HRAP).1
 
Pursuant to Hawai 'i Revised Statutes (HRS) § 641-1(a) 
(1993 & Supp. 2010),
 
appeals are allowed in civil matters from all final
judgments, orders, or decrees of circuit and district
courts. In district court cases, a judgment includes any
order from which an appeal lies. A final order means an
 
order ending the proceeding, leaving nothing further to be
accomplished. When a written judgment, order, or decree
ends the litigation by fully deciding all rights and
liabilities of all parties, leaving nothing further to be
adjudicated, the judgment, order, or decree is final and
appealable.
 
Casumpang v. ILWU, Local 142, 91 Hawai 'i 425, 426, 984 P.2d 1251, 
1252 (1999) (citations, internal quotation marks, and footnote 
omitted; emphases added). The June 10, 2009 order dismissing the Appellees' complaint appears to be the last in the series of documents that gave finality to this case by dismissing the Appellees' complaint, leaving nothing further to be adjudicated. Therefore, the district court's June 10, 2009 order dismissing the Appellees' complaint is an appealable final order under HRS § 641-1(a). 
However, Appellant Ambrose Fernandez did not file the
 
August 23, 2010 notice of appeal within thirty days after entry
 of the June 10, 2009 order dismissing the Appellees' complaint,
 as HRAP Rule 4(a)(1) required. Therefore, Appellant Ambrose
 Fernandez's appeal in Appeal No. 30708 is untimely. The failure

 The Appellees also argue that this appeal should be dismissed
because Appellant Ambrose Fernandez was not aggrieved by the appealable order.
We need not address this claim because we conclude the appeal was untimely.

to file a timely notice of appeal in a civil matter is a
 
jurisdictional defect that the parties cannot waive and the
 appellate courts cannot disregard in the exercise of judicial
 discretion. Bacon v. Karlin, 68 Haw. 648, 650, 727 P.2d 1127,
 
1128 (1986); HRAP Rule 26(b) ("[N]o court or judge or justice is
 authorized to change the jurisdictional requirements contained in
 Rule 4 of [the HRAP]."). Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Appellees' February 11, 2011
 
motion to dismiss Appeal No. 30708 is granted.
 
We decline to rule piecemeal on Appellees’ request for
 
fees and costs. If Appellees seek attorney’s fees and costs,
 they should file an appropriate motion identifying the specific
 amount claimed with supporting documentation.
