SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Foley and Fujise, JJ.)
 
These two appeals, which we consolidated for
 
disposition, arise from a dispute over whether the Director of
 
Labor and Industrial Relations (Director) should have required
 
the payment of interest on disputed billings under Hawai 'i 
Administrative Rules (HAR) § 12-15-94(c). At the time relevant
 to these appeals, HAR § 12-15-94(c) (1996) provided:
 
The employer, after accepting liability, shall pay all
charges billed within sixty calendar days of receipt of such
charges except for items where there is a reasonable
disagreement. If more than sixty calendar days lapse
between the employer's receipt of an undisputed billing and
date of payment, payment of billing shall be increased by
one per cent per month of the outstanding balance. In the
 event of disagreement, the employer shall pay for all
acknowledged charges within sixty days of receipt and shall
negotiate with the provider of service on items in
disagreement.
 
(Emphasis added.)1
 
1/ If the parties cannot resolve their billing dispute, HAR § 12-15-94(d)
(2001) sets forth a procedure for the Director to resolve the dispute as
follows: 
In the event a reasonable disagreement relating to specific
charges cannot be resolved, the employer or provider of service
may request intervention by the director in writing with notice to
the other party. Both the front page of the billing dispute
request and the envelope in which the request is mailed shall be
clearly identified as a "BILLING DISPUTE REQUEST" in capital
letters and in no less than ten point type. The director shall
 send the parties a notice and the parties shall negotiate during
the thirty-one calendar days following the date of the notice from
the director. If the parties fail to come to an agreement during
the thirty-one calendar days, then within fourteen calendar days
following the thirty-one day negotiating period, either party may
file a request, in writing, to the director to review the dispute
with notice to the other party. The director shall send the
 parties a second notice requesting the parties file position
statements, with substantiating documentation to specifically
include the amount in dispute and a description of actions taken
to resolve the dispute, within fourteen calendar days following
the date of the second notice from the director. The director
 shall review the positions of both parties and render an
administrative decision without hearing. A service fee of up to
$500 payable to the State of Hawaii General Fund will be assessed
at the discretion of the director against either or both parties

Appellant-Appellant Emerson M.F. Jou, M.D. (Dr. Jou)
 
appeals from two decisions and orders issued by the Labor and
 
Industrial Relations Appeals Board (LIRAB). In Appeal No. 30710,
 
Dr. Jou appeals from the Decision and Order filed by the LIRAB on
 
August 9, 2010, in Case No. AB 2009-230 in favor of Employer-
Appellee City Mill (City Mill) and Insurance Carrier-Appellee
 
Argonaut Insurance Company (Argonaut) (collectively, "Employer
 
1"). In Appeal No. 30711, Dr. Jou appeals from the Decision and
 
Order filed by the LIRAB on August 2, 2010, in Case No. AB 2009­
231 in favor of Employer-Appellee Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort
 
(Waikiki Marriott) and Insurance Carrier-Appellee Marriott Claims
 
Service Association (Marriott) (collectively, "Employer 2"). 
The LIRAB granted the motions for summary judgment
 
filed by Employer 1 and Employer 2, and thereby affirmed the
 
Director's determinations that Dr. Jou was not entitled to
 
interest on billings which Employer 1 and Employer 2 had
 
disputed. As explained below, we affirm the LIRAB's Decision and
 
Order in both cases.
 
I.
 
Much of the relevant background facts and the 
procedural history in these consolidated appeals is set forth in our decision in Jou v. Hamada, 120 Hawai
'i 101, 201 P.3d 614 
(App. 2009), and will not be repeated here.2 In Jou, we held 
that the provision of HAR § 12-15-94(d) that prohibited any 
appeal of the Director's decisions in billing disputes between 
employers and medical service providers in workers' compensation 
cases was invalid as beyond the Director's rulemaking power. Id. 
1/ (...continued)
who fail to negotiate in good faith. The decision of the director
 
is final and not appealable.
 
2/ In Jou, we consolidated appeals involving the same underlying cases as
the present appeals. 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 104, 201 P.3d at 617. We further held that Dr. Jou shall be
 
permitted to file appeals of the Director's decisions in these
 
two cases with the LIRAB within twenty days of the effective date
 
of our judgment on appeal. Id. at 114, 201 P.3d at 627. We
 
expressed no opinion on the merits of Dr. Jou's challenges to the
 Director's decisions. Id. 
Dr. Jou thereafter appealed the Director's decisions,
 
which had denied his requests for interest, to the LIRAB. 
Employer 1 and Employer 2 both moved for summary judgment,
 
arguing, among other things, that (1) HAR § 12-15-94(c) only
 
authorized the imposition of a one percent interest penalty on
 
undisputed unpaid invoices, and (2) because there was no factual
 
dispute that Employer 1 and Employer 2 had disputed Dr. Jou's
 
invoices, Employer 1 and Employer 2 were entitled to a decision
 
in their favor as a matter of law. Dr. Jou filed oppositions to
 
the motions of Employer 1 and Employer 2. 
In August 2010, the LIRAB issued its decisions and
 
orders granting the motions for summary judgment filed by
 
Employer 1 and Employer 2. In granting Employer 1's motion for
 
summary judgment in Case No. AB 2009-230, the LIRAB concluded:
 
"There is no factual disagreement that [Employer 1] disputed Dr.
 
Jou's November 9, 2000 bill for massage services rendered from
 
October 2, 2000 through October 23, 2000. Said dispute was
 
reasonable, and, therefore, the interest provisions of [HAR] 
§ 12-15-94(c) . . . do not apply."
 
In granting Employer 2's motion for summary judgment in
 
Case No. AB 2009-231, the LIRAB determined that Dr. Jou's appeal
 
only raised the issue of whether Dr. Jou was entitled to interest
 
on his billings for office visits on June 2, 2001, and June 18,
 
2001, and did not raise the issue of his entitlement to interest
 
on the billings for massage services for the period May 10, 2001,
 
to June 21, 2001. The LIRAB agreed with Employer 2's argument
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
that the interest provisions of HAR § 12-15-94(c) did not apply
 
to disputed billings. The LIRAB stated:
 
[Employer 2] argues that because there was no factual
dispute that [Employer 2] disputed Dr. Jou's invoices, and
because only "undisputed" unpaid invoices are subject to the
1% interest penalty under [HAR] § 12-15-94(c) . . . ,
[Employer 2] is entitled to a decision as a matter of law.
The [LIRAB] finds [Employer 2's] position to be correct;
because [Employer 2] timely disputed Dr. Jou's bills for
office visits on June 2, 2001 and June 18, 2001, the
interest provisions of [HAR] § 12-15-94(c) . . . do not
apply.
 
(Emphasis added.) The LIRAB concluded: "There is no factual
 
disagreement that [Employer 2] disputed Dr. Jou's bill for office
 
visits on June 2, 2001 and June 18, 2001. Said dispute was
 
reasonable, and, therefore, the interest provisions of [HAR] 
§ 12-15-94(c) . . . do not apply."
 
II.
 
On appeal, Dr. Jou argues in both Appeal No. 30710 and
 
Appeal No. 30711 that: (1) the LIRAB erred in granting summary
 judgment on reasonableness as a matter of law; (2) the LIRAB
 
erred in overlooking the record which showed that the employer's
 
dispute was unreasonable; (3) "decisions, including subsequent
 
cost-branch review letters[,] did not support . . . [the]
 
LIRAB's conclusion of reasonableness" (initial capitalization
 
omitted); (4) the LIRAB's decision to uphold the Director's
 
decision violated Dr. Jou's due process rights; and (5) the LIRAB
 
misconstrued HAR § 12-15-94(c) in denying Dr. Jou's request for
 
interest.
3
 
3/ In Appeal No. 30711, Dr. Jou additionally argues that the LIRAB erred
in failing to modify its pretrial order and to consider Dr. Jou's claim that
he was entitled to interest on his billings for massage services as well as
the billing for the two office visits. Given our analysis in these two
appeals, we need not reach this additional argument. 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
A.
 
The decision in these two appeals turns on the
 
interpretation of HAR § 12-15-94(c).4 Namely, (1) whether HAR 
§ 12-15-94(c) mandates the imposition of the one percent per
 
month interest penalty only on an employer who does not dispute
 
the billings and fails to pay for more than sixty days or (2)
 
whether HAR § 12-15-94(c) also requires the Director to determine
 
the reasonableness of an employer's billing dispute and to impose
 
the one percent per month interest penalty if the Director
 
determines the employer's dispute was unreasonable. 
As noted, at the time relevant to these appeals, HAR 
§ 12-15-94(c) provided:
 
The employer, after accepting liability, shall pay all
charges billed within sixty calendar days of receipt of such
charges except for items where there is a reasonable
disagreement. If more than sixty calendar days lapse
between the employer's receipt of an undisputed billing and
date of payment, payment of billing shall be increased by
one per cent per month of the outstanding balance. In the
 event of disagreement, the employer shall pay for all
acknowledged charges within sixty days of receipt and shall
negotiate with the provider of service on items in
disagreement.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
4/ For purposes of our analysis, there is no material difference between
the current version of HAR § 12-15-94(c) and the version applicable to these
two appeals. The current version of HAR § 12-15-94(c) provides:
 
The employer, after accepting liability, shall pay all
charges billed within sixty calendar days of receipt of such
charges except for items where there is a reasonable disagreement.
If more than sixty calendar days lapse between the employer's
receipt of an undisputed billing and date of payment, payment of
billing shall be increased by one per cent per month of the
outstanding balance. In the event of disagreement, the employer
shall pay for all acknowledged charges and shall notify the
provider of service, copying the claimant, of the denial of
payment and the reason for denial of payment within sixty calendar
days of receipt. Furthermore, the employer's denial must
explicitly state that if the provider of service does not agree,
the provider of service may file a "BILL DISPUTE REQUEST" to
include a copy of the original bill with the director within sixty
calendar days after postmark of the employer's objection, and
failure to do so shall be construed as acceptance of the
employer's denial.
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Employer 1 and Employer 2 argue that HAR § 12-15-94(c) 
clearly provides that the one percent per month interest penalty 
is to be imposed only when an employer fails to pay an undisputed 
bill within sixty days. We agree. We conclude that under the 
plain language of HAR § 12-15-94(c), the imposition of the one 
percent per month interest penalty only applies to undisputed 
billings that remain unpaid for more than sixty calendar days. 
See Kaleikini v. Yoshioka, 128 Hawai 'i 53, 67, 283 P.3d 60, 74 
(2012) (applying general principles of statutory construction to the interpretation of administrative rules). 
Our interpretation of HAR § 12-15-94(c) also appears to
 
be consistent with how the LIRAB and the Director have
 
interpreted the rule. See id. ("An agency's interpretation of
 
its own rules is generally entitled to deference.") As noted, in
 granting Employer 2's motion for summary judgment, the LIRAB
 
stated that Employer 2's position that the one percent interest
 
penalty under HAR § 12-15-94(c) only applies to undisputed
 
billings was correct. The record also reflects that in denying
 
Dr. Jou's request that Employer 1 be required to pay the interest
 
penalty, the Administrator of the Disability Compensation
 
Division of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations
 
stated:
 
Pursuant to Section 12-15-94(c), Hawaii Administrative
Rules, a one per cent per month simple interest is invoked
for late payment of fees with no just cause, i.e., involves
no dispute over a fee.
 
Therefore, with employer's payment of the disputed
fees, we deem this bill complaint resolved and employer
shall not be liable for an assessment of one per cent per
month simple interest.
 
HAR § 12-15-94(c) was implemented pursuant to Hawaii
 
Revised Statutes (HRS) § 386–21(c). HRS § 386–21(c) (Supp. 2012)
 
provides in relevant part:
 
7
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
When a dispute exists between an insurer or
self-insured employer and a medical services provider
regarding the amount of a fee for medical services, the
director may resolve the dispute in a summary manner as the
director may prescribe; provided that a provider shall not
charge more than the provider's private patient charge for
the service rendered.
 
(Emphasis added.) HRS § 386–21(c) authorizes the Director to
 
resolve disputes over billings for medical services in an summary
 
manner; it does not require the Director to determine the
 
reasonableness of a billing dispute or to impose an interest
 
penalty on a disputed billing if the Director determines the
 
employer's dispute was unreasonable. Accordingly, HAR § 12-15­
94(c)'s imposition of an interest penalty only on undisputed
 
billings that remain unpaid for sixty calendar days does not
 
conflict with, and is not inconsistent with, HRS § 386–21(c). 
The Director could rationally have decided to limit the 
interest penalty to situations where the criteria for imposing 
the penalty was clear -- the billing was not disputed -- and to 
avoid creating additional issues, which would detract from 
resolving billing disputes in a summary manner, that would be 
generated by extending the interest penalty to disputed billings 
upon a determination by the Director that the employer's dispute 
was unreasonable. We note that HAR § 12-15-94 is not devoid of 
disincentives to an employer's disputing a billing unreasonably. 
HAR § 12-15-94(d) authorizes the Director to assess a service fee 
of up to $500 against a party who fails to negotiate a disputed 
billing in good faith. In addition, HRS 386-93(a) (Supp. 2012) 
authorizes the Director and the LIRAB to impose attorney's fees 
and costs against a party who has without reasonable ground 
brought or defended a proceeding under the Hawai 'i Workers' 
Compensation Law.5 
5/ In Botelho v. Atlas Recycling Centers, LLC, No. 30226, 2013 WL 764878
(Hawai'i App. Feb. 28, 2013) (memorandum opinion), we held that the pre-2012
(continued...)

B.
 
Because we construe HAR § 12-15-94(c) as authorizing
 
the imposition of the interest penalty only on undisputed
 
billings, and because it is uncontested that the billings on
 
which Dr. Jou sought the imposition of the interest penalty were
 
disputed by Employer 1 and Employer 2, we conclude that the LIRAB
 
did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Employer 1
 
and Employer 2. In light of our construction of HAR § 12-15­
94(c), we need not address Dr. Jou's claims that the LIRAB erred
 
in determining that the disputes by Employer 1 and Employer 2
 
over Dr. Jou's billings were reasonable. Dr. Jou does not cite
 
any persuasive authority to support his claim that the LIRAB
 
violated his due process rights, and we reject this claim. Based
 
on our analysis, we also reject Dr. Jou's claim that the LIRAB
 
misconstrued HAR § 12-15-94(c) in denying his requests for
 
interest.
