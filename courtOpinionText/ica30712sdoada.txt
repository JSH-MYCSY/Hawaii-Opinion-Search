Defendant-Appellant Henry Moisa (Moisa) appeals from
 
Judgment of Conviction and Sentence (Judgment) filed August 4,
 
1
2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit  (circuit court). 
A jury found Moisa guilty of three counts of Sexual Assault in

less than sixteen years old; provided that:
 
(i)	 The person is not less than five years older
than the minor; and
 
(ii)	 The person is not legally married to the
minor[.]
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
On appeal, Moisa contends the circuit court erred
 
(1) in not granting his August 13, 2008 Motion for
 
Bill of Particulars or in the Alternative, Motion to Dismiss
 (Motion for Bill of Particulars);
 
(2) when it denied his November 17, 2008 Motion in
 
Limine No. 2 regarding the introduction of pornographic materials
 
into evidence, but allowed testimony at trial about the
 
materials, testimony he claims violated Hawaii Rules of Evidence
 
(HRE) Rules 403, 404, 404(b), and 611;
 
(3) by allowing Dr. Alexander Bivens (Dr. Bivens) and
 
Dr. Guliz Erdem (Dr. Erdem) to testify at trial, which amounted
 
to improper vouching;
 
(4) in refusing to allow him to cross-examine and to
 
present evidence of prior psychological and psychiatric history
 
of Complaining Witness (CW) and precluding evidence from CW's
 
father that CW had made prior sex abuse allegations;
 
(5) in not granting his May 21, 2010 Motion for
 
Judgment of Acquittal, or in the Alternative, a New Trial (Motion
 
for Judgment of Acquittal) when the evidence was insufficient to
 
establish guilt;
 
(6) by refusing to give a jury instruction on alibi
 
3
defense and by not giving an Arceo  unanimity instruction before
the jury began deliberations;
 
(7) in denying his August 10, 2010 Motion to Dismiss
 
Due to Constitutional Errors and Rule 16 Violations or for New
 Trial (Motion to Dismiss or for New Trial) after it was revealed
 
that his constitutional right to pretrial discovery had been
 
violated; and
 
(8) in not sufficiently deleting prejudicial unproven
 
allegations against him in the Presentence Report.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
3
 State v. Arceo, 84 Hawai' i 1, 928 P.2d 843 (1996). 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we resolve Moisa's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(1) The circuit court did not err when it denied Moisa 
a bill of particulars requiring the State of Hawai' i (the State) 
to provide specific dates when the alleged sexual assaults occurred. In general, where time is not of the essence in the 
elements of the offense, "the precise time and date of the 
commission of an offense is not regarded as a material element." 
Arceo, 84 Hawai' i at 13, 928 P.2d at 855. The precise date and 
time of an alleged sexual assault of a minor "are not elements of the offense and are unnecessary to sustain a conviction." Id. 
(quoting People v. Jones, 792 P.2d 643, 655 (Cal. 1990)). "Hawaii has long recognized that, in cases involving sexual abuse 
of minors, it is sufficient, in the indictment, to allege that 
the offense occurred over a particular time span[.]". State v. 
Sherman, 70 Haw. 334, 339, 770 P.2d 789, 792 (1989). The general time frame of May 31, 2007 through May 5, 2008 stated in the 
indictment was sufficient, and the circuit court did not abuse 
its discretion when it did not grant a bill of particulars. 
(2) The circuit court did not err when it ruled that
 
if CW testified about pornographic materials and Moisa took the
 
stand, the State could ask Moisa on cross-examination "whether he
 
possessed such material during the relevant time period." The
 
circuit court granted Moisa's Motion in Limine No. 2 to prohibit
 
the State from introducing into evidence pornographic DVDs and
 
magazines found in Moisa's home. However, the circuit court
 
ruled that if CW talked about the pornographic materials, then
 
the State could cross-examine Moisa about "whether he possessed
 
such material during the relevant time period."
 
In determining whether relevant evidence is admissible
 
under HRE Rule 403, the trial court must maintain "the delicate
 
balance between probative value and prejudicial effect." Kaeo v.
 
Davis, 68 Haw. 447, 454, 719 P.2d 387, 392 (1986) (internal
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
quotation marks and citations omitted). CW testified that there
 
were pornographic magazines in Moisa's truck and he watched
 
pornographic videos in Moisa's house. Moisa took the stand and
 
on cross-examination the State asked Moisa about pornography -­
what it is, who can buy it -- and whether he had pornographic
 
materials in his truck and his house. Because this case turned
 
on the credibility of the parties, the circuit court did not
 
abuse its discretion when it allowed Moisa to be questioned about
 
the materials CW testified Moisa possessed.
 
(3) The circuit court did not err in admitting the 
testimonies of expert witnesses Dr. Bivens and Dr. Erdem. Their
 
testimonies did not represent improper vouching. 
HRE Rule 702 provides in part:
 
Rule 702 Testimony by experts.  If scientific,
technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the
trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a
 fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by
knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may
testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.
 
With respect to expert testimony, the critical inquiry
 
is "whether it will assist the trier of fact to understand the
 
evidence or determine a fact in issue." State v. Castro, 69 Haw
 
633, 647, 756 P.2d 1033, 1043 (1988) (internal quotation marks,
 citation, and brackets omitted). An expert witness provides
 
"knowledge not possessed by the average trier of fact." State v.
 
Batangan, 71 Haw. 552, 556, 799 P.2d 48, 51 (1990). Expert
 testimony must be based "upon a sound factual foundation; any
 
inferences or opinions are the product of an explicable and
 
reliable system of analysis; and the opinions add to the common
 
understanding of the jury." Castro, 69 Haw. at 647, 756 P.2d at
 
1043 (internal quotation marks, citation, brackets, and ellipsis
 omitted).
 
Dr. Bivens testified "as an expert in clinical
 
psychology with a speciality of dynamics in child sex abuse." 
Dr. Bivens discussed studies and research relating to child
 
sexual molestation. Moisa cites to no evidence that Dr. Bivens
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
offered an opinion regarding CW or that Dr. Bivens' testimony
 
served to improperly bolster CW's credibility.
 
The circuit court also did not err when it determined 
that a possible improper statement made by a second expert 
witness, Dr. Erdem, could be cured by an instruction to the jury 
to strike the statement. State v. Webster, 94 Hawai' i 241, 248, 
11 P.3d 466, 473 (2000) (it is within the trial court's discretion to determine whether an improper statement can be 
cured by a jury instruction). 
Without waiting for an objection from Moisa to the
 
State's witness's potentially improper statement, the circuit
 
court timely struck Dr. Erdem's statement and issued an
 
instruction to the jury to disregard the statement. "A jury is
 
presumed to follow the court's instructions." Id. Furthermore,
 
Moisa is precluded from now objecting to an alleged error or its
 cure when he did not object at trial. HRS § 641-16 (1993); State
 
v. Matias, 57 Haw. 96, 101, 550 P.2d 900, 903-04 (1976).
 
(4) The circuit court did not err when it precluded
 
evidence of CW's prior accusations of sexual assault and prior
 
therapy related to the alleged sexual assaults, evidence which
 
Moisa contended was relevant to challenge CW's credibility.
 
Moisa failed to meet his burden to show by a 
preponderance of the evidence that CW's statements regarding the 
unrelated sexual assault allegations were false. State v. West, 
95 Hawai' i 452, 461, 24 P.3d 648, 657 (2001). 
Hawai'i's rape shield statute generally precludes a 
defendant from introducing evidence of an alleged victim's past sexual behavior. HRE Rule 412 (b) (Supp. 2010). However, 
"evidence of false statements of unrelated sex assaults are not 
excluded by the rape shield statute because they are not evidence 
of sexual conduct." West, 95 Hawai' i at 458, 24 P.3d at 654. 
"Under HRE Rule 608(b), evidence of specific acts, if probative of truthfulness, may be introduced for the purposes of attacking 
the credibility of a witness." West, 95 Hawai' i at 458, 24 P.3d 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
at 654 (emphasis added). Before statements made by CW regarding
 
an unrelated sexual assault may be introduced, "the trial court
 
must make a preliminary determination based on a preponderance of
 
the evidence that the statements are false." Id. at 460, 24 P.3d
 
at 656. When asked for her offer of proof that the prior
 allegations were false, Moisa's counsel responded, "actually, I'm
 
not going to say that they were false." Moisa did not meet the
 
standard of proof for the circuit court to admit the evidence of
 
CW's prior allegations.
 
Moisa misstates the rulings of the circuit court when
 
he argues that the circuit court violated his constitutional
 
rights when it "did not allow cross examination on specific
 
reasons for prior psychological treatment." The circuit court
 
ruled it would allow defense counsel to ask CW the following
 
question: "Isn't it true that until the present you . . .
 
received psychotherapy from four different doctors for a variety
 
of reasons." The circuit court also stated that defense counsel
 
could ask CW the reasons he was in therapy. Defense counsel
 
asked CW to confirm that he had been in therapy from 1998 until
 
2006, but did not ask CW why he had been in therapy -- even
 
though the circuit court had allowed that question.
 
The circuit court also stated that it would probably
 
allow Moisa to question CW's mother about CW's eight years of
 
treatment by psychologists, depending on whether CW's mother
 
opened the door. On direct, Moisa did not ask CW's mother any
 
questions about therapy. Based on the transcripts, it is evident
 
that the circuit court did not prevent Moisa from asking the
 
questions he now contends he was precluded from asking.
 
Additionally, the circuit court also did not err in
 
precluding CW's father's testimony because Moisa stated that he
 
intended to have CW's father testify as to the same events that
 
the court had already correctly precluded under West.

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
(5) The circuit court did not err when it denied
 
Moisa's Motion for Judgment of Acquittal because there was
 
substantial evidence to support his conviction.
 
It is settled law that "evidence adduced in the trial 
court must be considered in the strongest light for the 
prosecution when the appellate court passes on the legal 
sufficiency of such evidence to support a conviction." State v. 
Eastman, 81 Hawai' i 131, 135, 913 P.2d 57, 61 (1996). "The test 
on appeal is not whether guilt is established beyond a reasonable 
doubt, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the 
conclusion of the trier of fact." State v. Richie, 88 Hawai' i 
19, 33, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998) (quoting State v. Quitog, 85 Hawai'i 128, 145, 938 P.2d 559, 576 (1997)). 
Due deference must be given to the right of the trier
 
of fact to "determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw
 
justifiable inferences of fact from the evidence adduced." State
 
v. Naeole, 62 Haw. 563, 565, 617 P.2d 820, 823 (1980). "[T]he factfinder may accept or reject any witness'[s] testimony in 
whole or in part." Lono v. State, 63 Haw. 470, 473, 629 P.2d 
630, 633 (1981). The testimony of one percipient witness may constitute substantial evidence to support a conviction. 
Eastman, 81 Hawai' i at 141, 913 P.2d at 67. 
At trial, CW provided graphic details regarding
 
specific times when Moisa allegedly assaulted him. CW had
 
disclosed the sexual assault to his friend, who corroborated CW's
 
testimony at trial. Dr. Bivens provided general testimony about
 
research on reasons why a minor would acquiesce to sexual
 
assaults and why a minor might delay in reporting the assaults. 
Witnesses for the defense testified that they never saw Moisa act
 
in a sexual way towards CW, but acknowledged they had not
 
necessarily worked on the days CW worked. Moisa testified he
 
never gave CW a blow job.
 
Giving due deference to the jury's determination of the
 
witnesses' credibility and the weight of the evidence and in the
 
7
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
light most favorable to the prosecution, there was substantial
 
evidence that Moisa committed the alleged sexual assaults.
 
(6) The circuit court did not err when it refused to
 
give the jury an instruction on the alibi defense and when it did
 
not give an Arceo unanimity instruction until after the jury had
 
begun deliberations.
 
(a) Alibi Defense Jury Instruction
 
Moisa served notice on the circuit court that he
 
intended to rely on an alibi defense at trial. An "alibi"
 defense is "an attempt by the defendant to demonstrate he did not
 
commit the crime because, at the time, he was in another place so
 
far away, or in a situation preventing his doing the thing
 
charged against him." State v. Cordeira, 68 Haw. 207, 210, 707
 
P.2d 373, 376 (1985) (internal quotation marks and citation
 omitted). At trial, Moisa merely claimed that "nothing
 
happened." No one testified that Moisa was at another location
 
during the time CW alleged the sexual assaults took place.
 
A defendant "is entitled to an instruction on every 
defense or theory of defense having any support in the evidence." 
State v. Pavao, 81 Hawai' i 142, 144, 913 P.2d 553, 555 (App. 
1996) (emphasis omitted) (quoting State v. Lira, 70 Haw. 23, 29, 759 P.2d 869, 873 (1988)). Moisa did not present an alibi 
defense, and the circuit court did not err when it did not give 
an alibi defense instruction. 
(b) Arceo Jury Instruction
 
The circuit court did not err when it did not give an
 
Arceo instruction before the jury began deliberations. The
 Hawai'i Supreme Court held in Arceo: 
[W]hen separate and distinct culpable acts are subsumed
within a single count charging a sexual assault -- any one
of which could support a conviction thereunder -- and the
defendant is ultimately convicted by a jury of the charged
offense, the defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous
verdict is violated unless one or both of the following
occurs: (1) at or before the close of its case-in-chief, the
prosecution is required to elect the specific act upon which
it is relying to establish the "conduct" element of the
charged offense; or (2) the trial court gives the jury a
specific unanimity instruction, i.e., an instruction that
 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
advises the jury that all twelve of its members must agree
that the same underlying criminal act has been proved beyond
a reasonable doubt.
 
84 Hawai' i at 32-33, 928 P.2d at 874-75 (emphases added; footnote 
omitted). 
Although CW testified that there had been "[m]aybe
 
about 40, 50" blow jobs, he only testified as to four distinct
 
alleged sexual assaults. During closing arguments, the State
 
described each of the four alleged acts and connected each with a
 
count. Testimony at trial focused on four specific acts, each
 
identified in a separate count. Therefore, an Arceo instruction
 
was not required.
 
However, on the second day of deliberations, the jury
 
sent Communication No. 1, asking: "The counts give a time frame
 
of several months. Are we to judge if something happened within
 
the time frame or are we to judge that a specific incident
 
occurred and occurred within that time frame." With no objection
 
from the parties, the circuit court gave the following Arceo
 
unanimity instruction:
 
For each of the four charged counts, in order for you
to find [Moisa] guilty you must unanimously agree that each
of the material elements of that particular count have been
proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As regards the conduct
element of each count, you must unanimously agree that
[Moisa] committed the specific act charged in that
particular count.
 
Moisa points to no case law to support his contention
 
that an instruction must be given prior to the beginning of jury
 
deliberations in order for the instruction to be timely. State
 
v. Miyashiro, 90 Hawai' i 489, 492, 979 P.2d 85, 88 (1999) ("[T]he 
circuit court's response to a jury communication is the 
functional equivalent of an instruction[.]"). The circuit court 
gave an Arceo instruction, whether or not it was needed, and only 
after the Arceo instruction had been given did the jury return 
its verdict. State v. Haanio, 94 Hawai' i 405, 415, 16 P.3d 246, 
256 (2001) ("[J]urors are presumed to follow the court's instructions[.]"). The circuit court did not err when it gave an 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
Arceo instruction pursuant to a jury communication after the jury
 
began deliberations.
 
(7) The circuit court did not err when it denied
 
Moisa's Motion to Dismiss or for New Trial pursuant to Hawai' i 
Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP) Rule 33, which provides:
 
Rule 33. NEW TRIAL.  The court on motion of a
 
defendant may grant a new trial to him if required in the
interest of justice. If trial was by the court without a
jury, the court on motion of a defendant for a new trial may
vacate the judgment if entered, take additional testimony
and direct the entry of a new judgment. A motion for a new
 
trial shall be made within 10 days after verdict or finding
of guilty or within such further time as the court may fix
during the 10-day period. The finding of guilty may be
entered in writing or orally on the record.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
Moisa argues that his constitutional rights were
 
violated because the State did not inform him that CW's mother
 
had filed a Crime Victim Compensation Commission form. The jury
 
returned its verdict on May 11, 2010; Moisa's motion for a new
 
trial was not filed until August 10, 2010 -- well past the 10-day
 
time limit set forth in HRPP Rule 33. Therefore, the circuit
 
court correctly determined that Moisa's Motion to Dismiss or for
 
New Trial was untimely.
 
The circuit court also correctly determined that
 
Moisa's Motion to Dismiss or for a New Trial was inappropriate
 
because Moisa had asked the circuit court to dismiss the Judgment
 
pursuant to HRPP Rule 40(a)(1). A Rule 40 petition is proper
 
when a defendant seeks relief from a judgment of conviction on
 
the grounds, among others, "that there is newly discovered
 
evidence." HRPP Rule 40(a)(1)(iv). The circuit court correctly
 
dismissed the motion on procedural grounds without getting to the
 
merits of the motion, reminding defense counsel of the correct
 
procedure for filing a Rule 40 petition. Our conclusion is not
 
to be construed as a bar to Moisa's right to challenge the
 
alleged pretrial discovery violation pursuant to HRPP Rule 40.
 
(8) Moisa contends the circuit court erred in not
 
completely blacking out prejudicial unproven allegations against
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
him in the Presentence Report so that the offending passage could
 
not be read. At a hearing on August 4, 2010, the circuit court
 
granted Moisa's request to strike the offending passage from the
 
Presentence Report. The circuit court drew a line through the
 
offending passage and initialed it. On appeal, Moisa asserts the
 
redaction was insufficient because the passage could still be
 
read, thereby prejudicing the Hawaii Paroling Authority.
 
Pursuant to HRS § 706-604 (1993 & Supp. 2010), a 
defendant is afforded an opportunity to respond to and rebut 
statements in a presentence report. State v. Lessary, 83 Hawai' i 
280, 284-85, 925 P.2d 1104, 1108-09 (App. 1996) (a defendant may controvert or supplement any presentence report). In the instant 
case, the circuit court granted Moisa's motion to strike a 
passage in the Presentence Report. Moisa cites to no evidence 
that the Hawaii Paroling Authority considered the offensive 
passage as a basis for the imposition of the minimum sentence, 
and the issue is not properly before us. Moisa is not precluded 
from raising this issue in an HRPP Rule 40 petition. 
Therefore,
 The Judgment of Conviction and Sentence filed August 4,
 
2010 in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is affirmed.
