Plaintiff-Appellee/Cross-Appellant Estrellita Gay Timon (Wife)
 cross-appeals from the Decree. 
On appeal, Husband contends the family court committed
 
the following errors: (1) the family court abused its discretion
 by awarding Wife temporary alimony in the amount of $4,000 per
 month; (2) the family court abused its discretion by ordering
 Husband to reimburse the home equity line after finding Husband
 violated the court's prior order; (3) the family court abused its
 discretion in determining Husband made unauthorized withdrawals,
 charging Husband with receipt of said amount, and ordering
 Husband to pay Wife's attorneys' fees and costs; (4) the family
 court clearly erred by (a) finding Husband failed to establish
 and prove receipt of and net values of any date of marriage
 assets or during-marriage inheritances and therefore did not give
 Husband credit under the Martial Partnership Model for Husband's
 premarital property or during-marriage inheritances, (b) finding
 the current value of the party's real property was $480,600,
 (c) failing to find that Wife wasted assets, (d) finding that
 Husband's request for credit or payment for claimed allowance is
 unsupported and unreasonable and therefore failing to award a
 credit or payment for Husband's allowance and/or to allow
 reimbursement for his moorage pursuant to "Stipulation Regarding
 Sale of Dental Practice", (e) finding there to be insufficient
 evidence to allocate the court appointed master's fees between
 the parties and therefore failing to order Wife to pay the fees,
 (f) finding there to be insufficient evidence to determine the
 amount of 2009 taxes, or the allocation of such, and therefore
 failing to order Wife to contribute to the 2009 taxes; (5) the
 family court erred by concluding Husband's professional "personal
 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
goodwill" was not applicable after the practice was sold during
 
the marriage; and (6) the family court abused its discretion when
 it denied Husband's motion for reconsideration.
2
 
Based on the foregoing, Husband requests that this
 
court: (1) vacate paragraph 1 of the Order for Pre-Decree Relief
 and order reimbursement of any temporary alimony in excess of
 $1,000 per month; (2) vacate various Findings of Fact (FOF) and
 
3
Conclusions of Law (COL) filed on October 28, 2010 ; (3) vacate
the Order to Clarify Decision; and (4) vacate paragraph 7 of the
 Decree. 
On cross-appeal, Wife contends various FOFs and COLs by
 
4
the family court are erroneous  which amount to two general
claims: (1) the family court erred when it deviated from the
 Marital Partnership Model and abused its discretion by awarding
 Wife $65,062.31 less than a one-half share of the marital estate;
 and (2) the family court abused its discretion in denying Wife
 post-decree alimony. 
Based on the foregoing, Wife requests that this court
 
vacate or reverse the following: (1) paragraphs 2 and 7 of the
 Decree; (2) the Order to Clarify Decision; and (3) the challenged
 FOFs and COLs. 
For the reasons discussed below, we affirm in part,
 
vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings with regard to
 the equalization payment ordered by the family court.
 
2 We have reordered Husband's multiple points of error in order to
group them as Husband's arguments regarding interlocutory orders and Husband's
arguments regarding the final property division, and to group them by like
standard of review.
3
 Husband specifically requests this court vacate FOFs 20, 24, 25, 28,
73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 81, 82, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 94, 100, 101, 102, 104,
106, 107, 108, 109, 112, 113, 119, and 120, as well as COLs 5, 8, 11, 18, 20,
21, 23, 26, 31, 34, and 37(7). In the "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
Law," the family court found all of the orders previously entered in the case
to have been properly entered. Thus, while Husband is requesting specific
FOFs and COLs be reversed, he is also challenging the bases upon which the
orders were issued. 
4
 Wife challenges FOFs 65, 66, 112, 120, 121, and 122, as well as COLs
27, 34, 37(2), and 37(7).

I. Husband's Appeal
A. Interlocutory Orders
 
Husband contends the family court abused its discretion
 
by ordering him to pay $4,000 per month in temporary alimony in
 
the Order for Pre-Decree Relief, ordering him to reimburse the
 home equity line in the Order re First Contempt Motion, and
 ordering him to reimburse unauthorized withdrawals from accounts
 in the Order re Second Contempt Motion.
 
Generally, the family court possesses wide discretion
in making its decisions and those decision [sic] will not be
set aside unless there is a manifest abuse of discretion. 
Thus, [an appellate court] will not disturb the family
court's decisions on appeal unless the family court
disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the
substantial detriment of a party litigant and its decision
clearly exceeded the bounds of reason.
 
Fisher v. Fisher, 111 Hawai 'i 41, 46, 137 P.3d 355, 360 (2006) 
(quoting In re Doe, 95 Hawai 'i 183, 189-90, 20 P.3d 616, 622-23 
(2001)). "Furthermore, the burden of establishing abuse of 
discretion is on appellant, and a strong showing is required to establish it." Ek v. Boggs, 102 Hawai
'i 289, 294-95, 75 P.3d 
1180, 1185-86 (2003) (internal quotation marks, citation, and brackets omitted).
1. Temporary Alimony
 
The family court did not abuse its discretion in
 
awarding Wife $4,000 in temporary alimony. It is within a
 court's discretion to make an award of temporary alimony pursuant
 
5
to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 580-9 (2006),  "limited only
by the standard that it be fair and reasonable." Farias v.
 
Farias, 58 Haw. 227, 232, 566 P.2d 1104, 1108 (1977) (quoting
 
5 HRS § 580-9 provides:
 
§ 580-9. Temporary support, etc. After the filing of a
complaint for divorce or separation the court may make such
orders relative to the personal liberty and support of
either spouse pending the complaint as the court may deem
fair and reasonable and may enforce the orders by summary
process. The court may also compel either spouse to advance
reasonable amounts for the compensation of witnesses and
other expenses of the trial, including attorney's fees, to
be incurred by the other spouse and may from time to time
amend and revise the orders.

Richards v. Richards, 44 Haw. 491, 496-97, 355 P.2d 188, 192-93
 
(1960)). 
If a party's income is insufficient to maintain both an
 
accustomed standard of living and efficient litigation of the
 case, a court may award temporary alimony. Farias, 58 Haw. at
 
232, 566 P.2d at 1108. At the time of the Order for Pre-Decree
 Relief (February 2008), Husband was a dentist who made $33,490.85
 gross income as monthly average net business profit, while Wife
 earned social security benefits in the amount of $887 per month. 
Husband's own income and expenses report stated that, after
 expenses which included paying for the marital residence, he
 saved $14,270.24 each month. Wife reported she had non-house
 related expenses of $9,280 per month, well above her net monthly
 income. Furthermore, the Order for Pre-Decree Relief made no
 mention of attorneys' fees, thus it appears Wife was responsible
 to pay her own legal expenses until subsequent orders were issued
 as to fees.
6
 
A court has discretion to "enable the wife to live
 
comfortably, pending the litigation, in the station in life to
 which [her husband] accustomed her." Richards, 44 Haw. at
 
497-98, 355 P.2d at 193 (quoting Harding v. Harding, 32 N.E. 206,
 208 (Ill. 1892)). In light of the circumstances of this case,
 the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Wife
 $4,000 per month in temporary alimony.
2. Reimbursement of the Home Equity Line
 
Husband asserts the family court erred in ordering him
 
to reimburse the home equity line to its early-January 2008
 balance in the Order re First Contempt Motion because no court
 order restraining expenditures was in effect and his receipt of
 an advance of $30,000 was used to pay marital debts. Husband
 fails to cite to evidence to support either contention, or to any
 
6
 Temporary alimony can be modified prospectively when there is a
showing of a change in circumstances. Farias, 58 Haw. at 233, 566 P.2d at
 
1108. Husband never moved for modification after the court ordered him to pay
some of Wife's attorneys' fees in subsequent orders or after his financial
situation changed.

authority which indicates how the court erred. Where an 
appellant fails to cite to any authority or parts of the record to support their argument, the party waives the argument. Taniguchi v. Ass'n of Apartment Owners of King Manor, Inc., 114 Hawai
'i 37, 53, 155 P.3d 1138, 1154 (2007).
3. Reimbursement of Unauthorized Withdrawals
 
Husband contends the family court erred in ordering him
 
7 8
to reimburse $43,416  to the depository accounts  and pay Wife's
attorneys' fees and costs in litigating the motion resulting in
 the Order re Second Contempt Motion. 
Husband proffers two arguments as to why the family
 
9
court erred: the doctrine of law of the case,  and the withdrawn
money was spent for Wife's benefit and Husband's allowance. 
Husband's law of the case argument is without merit. 
The family court found Husband made unauthorized withdrawals in
 violation of the family court's October 21, 2009 order freezing
 the depository accounts and the Order to Enforce which prohibited
 withdrawals from the depository accounts beyond November 2009. 
Those orders were in place as a result of Wife's motion to
 enforce the August 4, 2009 "Stipulation Regarding Sale of Dental
 Practice," an agreement between the parties to allow Husband to
 sell his dental practice. Thus, Husband made unauthorized
 withdrawals in violation of the court's orders which enforced a
 stipulation between the parties. Further, even if we accept
 
7 In her memorandum in opposition to Husband's motion for
reconsideration on the Order re Second Contempt Motion, Wife acknowledged it
was a mistake on her part to request, and the court to order, $43,416 be
reimbursed to the depository account, as Husband actually spent $42,319.02 in
unauthorized funds. The family court noted in FOF 47 that at no time did
Husband present any evidence or offer any cogent reasons to overturn the Order
re Second Contempt Motion. 
8
 In the August 4, 2009 "Stipulation Regarding Sale of Dental
Practice," the parties agreed, in pertinent part, that Husband's dental
practice could be sold pursuant to the "Dental Practice Purchase and Sale
Agreement," and the net proceeds of the sale were to be placed into two
Central Pacific Bank accounts, ******1096 ($240,000) and ******1534
($114,886.05).

 "[T]he doctrine of law of the case . . . refers to the usual practice
of courts to refuse to disturb all prior rulings in a particular case[.]" Wong
v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 66 Haw. 389, 396, 665 P.2d 157, 162 (1983).

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Husband's contention that the withdrawn money was authorized by
 
the previously entered January 8, 2009 "Stipulation Re
 Defendant's Motion for Pre-Decree Relief (Filed October 31, 2008)
 and Resolving Other Issues and Order" (January 2009 Stipulation
 and Order), all of the unauthorized withdrawals occurred after
 the October 21, 2009 order freezing the accounts. Husband
 violated court orders.
 
Husband's contention that the withdrawn money was spent
 
for the benefit of Wife does not alleviate the fact he
 unilaterally withdrew money from the depository accounts in
 violation of court orders.
10 Between October 24, 2009, and
 
January 6, 2010, Husband withdrew a total of $72,551.32 from the
 depository accounts. However, Wife only sought, and the court
 only awarded, $43,416. At the January 13, 2010 hearing on Wife's
 motion to find Husband in contempt, Wife explained she only
 requested $43,416 after subtracting from the total withdrawals an
 amount she conceded were for her benefit in some manner. Thus,
 it appears the court already gave Husband credit for expenses for
 Wife's benefit. 
Husband does not offer any argument as to why the court
 
erred in ordering him to pay Wife's attorneys' fees and costs
 related to the motion outside of the general denial of the
 ordered reimbursement to the depository account. 
Husband fails to demonstrate how the family court
 
abused its discretion in ordering Husband to reimburse the
 depository account.
B. Division of Property
 
Husband makes a series of challenges to the family
 
court's FOFs and COLs related to the credits given in the
 
property division. A court's FOFs and COLs that are a mixture of
 
10 Confusingly, Husband argues he both withdrew the funds to repair his
boat as permitted under the January 2009 Stipulation and Order, and he
contends he withdrew the funds to pay for Wife's benefit and for joint
expenses. The positions are inapposite if we are considering the same
$43,416. For instance, in his opening brief, Husband alleges he spent
$43,342.91 on expenses that were either for Wife's benefit, joint expenses, or
his allowance.

fact and law are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. 
Chun v. Bd. of Trs. of Employees' Ret. Sys. of State of Hawai 'i, 
106 Hawai 'i 416, 430, 106 P.3d 339, 353 (2005). The trial 
court's determination is clearly erroneous when "the appellate 
court is left with the definite and firm conviction in reviewing the entire evidence that a mistake has been committed." Bhakta 
v. Cnty. of Maui, 109 Hawai
'i 198, 208, 124 P.3d 943, 953 
(2005);. Additionally, "[a]n appellate court will not pass upon issues dependent upon credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence; this is the province of the trial judge." Booth v. Booth, 90 Hawai
'i 413, 416, 978 P.2d 851, 854 (1999) (citations 
and internal quotation marks omitted).
1.	 Credit for Pre-marital Property and During
Marriage Inheritances
 
Husband argues the family court erred by failing to
 
credit Husband with Category 1 and Category 3 net market value of
 
separate property contributed to the partnership under the
 Marital Partnership Model. 
a.	 Pre-Marital Property
 
The family court stated in its FOFs that Husband 
provided no credible evidence of date of marriage (DOM) equity, credit, or entitlement for claimed pre-marital properties
11 and 
no evidence to demonstrate he ever owned property at 5949C Kalaniana
'ole Highway.12 The court concluded that because of the 
lack of credible and competent evidence to establish net equity 
11 Husband claims to have owned properties located at 84-770 Farrington
Highway (Lot 392A), 84-766 Farrington Highway (Lot 392B); 84-772 Farrington
Highway (Lot 392C), 84-776 Farrington Highway (Lot 393C), and 86-76 Pokai Bay
Street. 
12 On appeal, Husband also asserts that the court erred in not awarding
him a Category 1 contribution for property located at Lot 393C. Despite
Husband producing exhibits at trial related to Lot 393C, the family court did
not receive the exhibits into evidence and did not issue a FOF or COL
 concerning the particular piece of property. The only exhibit received into
evidence was Plaintiff's exhibit 90, which demonstrated Husband took out a
second mortgage on the property in 1981. Husband does not assign error to any
of the above. Arguments not raised on appeal are considered waived. Bitney
v. Honolulu Police Dept., 96 Hawai' i 243, 251, 30 P.3d 257, 265 (2001). In any
event, evidence produced by Husband regarding this property is the same type
rejected specifically for the other properties under Booth, supra. 
8
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
value of the properties at the date of marriage, it was proper to
 
deny Husband's request for Category 1 contributions pursuant to
 Booth.
 
Here, Husband introduced the following evidence for Lot
 
392A, Lot 392B, Lot 392C, and 86-76 Pokai Bay Street: personal
 testimony, agreement of sale, deed, and a personal calculation of
 DOM value. The family court found Husband's testimony self-
serving and not credible, and concluded his testimony and self-
constructed calculation of DOM value to be insufficient to
 establish net equity on date of marriage. 
Furthermore, for the property at 5949C Kalaniana
'ole 
Highway, the court found that Husband failed to demonstrate he acquired ownership of the property. No agreement of sale or deed for the property in Husband's name was received into evidence. The family court found his testimony not credible, unsubstantiated by the documentary evidence, and, in fact, inconsistent with the evidence.
13 
The assessment of the weight and credibility of 
Husband's evidence lay within the sound discretion of the family court. There are no grounds for this court to conclude the family court was clearly erroneous in denying Husband credit for Category 1 contributions. See Booth, 90 Hawai
'i at 416, 978 P.2d 
at 854 ("[I]n light of the fact that no actual appraisals were presented to the family court, the court's conclusion that respondent did not present sufficient evidence of the amount of equity on the date of marriage . . . cannot be said to be clearly erroneous."). 
13 Husband asserted he purchased the property from Donald and Martha Lou
McGrath and sold the property to Jan and Kiana Weinberg. However, Wife
produced a deed dated February 22, 1983, which transferred the property
directly from the McGraths to the Weinbergs, and was signed by Husband in the
role of "purchaser". 
9
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
b. During Marriage Inheritances
 
The family court found Husband failed to produce any
 
credible evidence to support his assertion that he received
 
inheritances totaling $244,999.99 during the marriage.14
 
On appeal, Husband does not reference any documentary
 
evidence in the record to substantiate he received inheritances
 or the amount of such.
15 He only cites to his testimony that he
 
received the alleged inheritances and Wife's general testimony
 that she was aware Husband received inheritances. Assessment of
 the weight and credibility of testimony lay within the sound
 discretion of the family court.
 
Like his claimed Category 1 contributions, there are no
 
grounds for this court to conclude that the court clearly erred
 in denying Husband Category 3 credit.
2. Valuation of Marital Residence
 
Husband argues that the family court erred when it
 
found the marital residence (on Prospect Street) had a 2010
 valuation of $480,600.
16 In FOFs 100-02 and COL 20, the family
 
court stated it based its valuation on the 2010 Real Property
 Assessment Notice by the City and County of Honolulu. 
Husband argues that a family court should use the fair
 
market value on the relevant date to determine the value of the
 marital residence pursuant to Antolik v. Harvey, 7 Haw. App. 313,
 318-19, 761 P.2d 305, 309 (1988). Fair market value is defined
 
14 Husband asserts he inherited from his aunt's estate funds totaling
$126,999.99 and from his mother's estate funds totaling roughly $118,000.
15 In his reply brief, Husband cites to Baker v. Bielski, 124 Hawai' i 
455, 248 P.3d 221 (App. 2011), for the proposition that Husband's personal
knowledge of the value of his inheritance is sufficient to establish the"existence of and the amount of the inheritances," when it's the only evidencepresented at trial on the issue. This characterization of the case ignoresthat the court was reviewing the admission into evidence of documentaryevidence to support the oral statements. Id. at 233-34, 248 P.3d at 467-68.
Furthermore, the court was considering the value of an asset (property), notthe existence of one (alleged inheritance). Id. 
16 In his reply brief, Husband argues that the 2010 Real Property
Assessment Notice (Plaintiff's Exhibit 77) was improperly admitted into
evidence because Wife lacked the personal knowledge to testify to the
assessment value. However, Exhibit 77 was not admitted into evidence. The
 Notice was admitted into evidence as Defendant's (Husband) Exhibit LLL. 
10
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
as "the amount at which an item would change hands from a willing 
seller to a willing buyer, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts." Antolik, 7 Haw. App. at 319, 761 P.2d at 309. During 
trial, Wife testified she would not sell the marital residence for $480,000 because she wanted to remain there. Husband argues his estimation that a fair selling price would be between $580,000 and $620,000 was in line with market conditions and consistent with a 2008 appraised value of $580,000. However, the family court, in its discretion, can rely upon an annual tax assessment and the party's asset and debt statements to calculate the value of property. Schiller v. Schiller, 120 
Hawai
'i 283, 294, 205 P.3d 548, 559 (App. 2009). The family 
court found the tax assessment was more accurate than the two-year old appraisal, in line with Wife's testimony regarding depreciation in value, and that Husband's testimony was not credible. Furthermore, the family court found that Wife's statement that she would not sell the residence for $480,000 did not reflect an accurate determination of fair market value because she did not want to sell for any price.
17 
The assessment of the weight and credibility of
 
evidence lay within the sound discretion of the family court. We
 do not have a firm conviction that a mistake has been made.
 
3. Wife's Alleged Waste
 
Husband contends the court erred in finding Wife did
 
not waste assets totaling $65,500. In FOF 105-108, the family
 court indicated that any withdrawals by Wife from Husband's bank
 accounts were done with his knowledge and for non-wasteful
 purposes. Husband provides no record citations to support his
 factual assertions for his arguments.
 
Husband alleges that Wife "equitably should be charged
 
with having received the dollar value of the reduction" because
 
17 Wife testified: "I've been living there, um, during this period of
time, uh, of separation, and I consider it my home. It's very safe. I know my
neighbors. I would like to continue to live there. I don't have a boat to live
on, so I'd like to live in the apartment." 
11
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
she reduced the dollar value of the marital estate during the 
"time of the divorce."18 Higashi v. Higashi, 106 Hawai 'i 228, 
242, 103 P.3d 388, 402 (App. 2004). Husband argues inter alia Wife should be charged with having received $7,500 that she used 
19
to pay to her attorney  and $28,000 for her own use (March 1,
2007 - $3,000; May 18, 2007 - $5,000; July 27, 2007 - $5,000;
 August 20, 2007 - $5,000; November 9, 2007 - $5,000; December 19,
 2007 - $5000).
20
 
Affording Husband the date of separation (June 2007) as
 
the commencement of the time of divorce, the March 1 and May 18
 withdrawals were prior to the time of divorce. Husband does not
 cite to any part of the record or any evidence regarding the
 remaining withdrawals which contradict the family court findings. 
The assessment of the weight and credibility of evidence lay
 within the sound discretion of the family court. Husband fails
 to show that the family court erred.
4.	 Costs of Repairs to Prowler
 
In his opening brief, Husband argues that the family
 
court erred in counting $85,118.66 expended on repairs to his
 boat "Prowler" against him in the final property division. 
Husband does not identify where in the record the alleged error
 
18	 Depending on the facts, the time of the divorce
commences on the earliest of the following dates: (i)
the date of the final separation in contemplation of
divorce (DOFSICOD); (ii) the date of the filing of the
complaint for divorce; (iii) the date one or both of
the parties took a substantial step toward the
DOFSICOD that subsequently occurred, or (iv) the date
one or both of the parties took a substantial step
toward the filing of the complaint for divorce that
was subsequently filed.
 
Higashi, 106 Hawai' i at 241, 103 P.3d at 401 (footnotes omitted).
19 The amount identified by Husband in briefing is inconsistent with
the evidence in the record. Review of the record shows the checks Husband
 cites to actually total $8,000 (June 25, 2007 - $500; July 15, 2007 - $2,500;
October 22, 2007 - $5,000). This discrepancy does not affect the analysis. 
20 Husband also claims that Wife should be charged with having received
$25,000 in saved alimony Wife deposited into a bank account and $5,000 she
gave her mother for safe keeping, both in 2008. Husband cites to no legal
authority which designates Wife's ability to save money she properly received
as temporary alimony as wasteful, or any evidence to identify marital funds
(besides alimony payments) as the source of the money.
 
12

was brought to the family court's attention. Pursuant to Hawai 'i 
Rules of Appellate Procedure (HRAP) Rule 28(b)(4), we can 
disregard this argument. HRAP Rule 28(b)(4) ("Points not presented in accordance with this section will be disregarded[.]").
5. Remaining Contentions
 
Husband argues the family court erred by failing to
 
order Wife to contribute to both the court appointed master's
 fees and the 2009 taxes, as well as denying Husband a
 credit/payment for an alleged missed allowance and moorage
 payment. In FOF 56 and 115-117, the family court indicated that
 insufficient evidence was presented to the court to determine
 allocation of the master's fees and 2009 taxes, and the request
 for a credit/payment was unsupported and unreasonable. 
For all of these issues, Husband does not point to
 
specific evidence in the record which controverts the court's
 findings. In regard to the master's fees, 2009 taxes, and the
 amount requested for moorage payments, Husband cites to
 testimony, but the assessment of the weight and credibility of
 evidence lay within the sound discretion of the family court. 
Additionally, Husband's argument that he should have
 
received a monthly allowance for January 2010 from marital funds
 is without merit because, pursuant to the Order re Second
 Contempt Motion, Husband was not permitted to use marital
 property to cover his living expenses after November 2009. 
Husband fails to indicate the family court clearly
 
erred on these issues.
 
C. "Personal Goodwill"
 
Husband argues that the family court erred by including
 
the personal goodwill portion of the sale price of his dental
 
practice as a marital asset. In a stipulation filed on August 4,
 2009, the parties stipulated that the sale of the dental practice
 could proceed pursuant to the terms of a Dental Practice Purchase
 and Sale Agreement (Dental Sale Agreement) attached as Exhibit
 "A" to the stipulation, "provided that neither party nor the
 
13
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
Court is bound by the allocation of the purchase price described
 
in said Exhibit 'A'." The Dental Sale Agreement allocates
 $200,000 of the sales price to personal goodwill. 
In COL 21, the family court concluded that "the 
precedent of Antolik v. Harvey, 7 Haw. App. 313, 761 P.2d 305 (1988), which found that personal goodwill can be excluded in estimating the value of a business involved in a marital dissolution, is not applicable after the business is sold during the marriage."
21 A court's conclusions of law are reviewed under 
the right/wrong standard. Chun, 106 Hawai 'i at 430, 106 P.3d at 
353.
 
We do not agree with the family court's legal
 
conclusion that the analysis in Antolik is always inapplicable
 once a business is sold during the marriage. In Antolik, this
 court adopted a view that "distinguishes between true goodwill
 which is a marketable business asset and the goodwill which is
 dependent on the continued presence of the professional involved. 
The former constitutes marital property, while the latter does
 not." 7 Haw. App. at 317-18, 761 P.2d at 308. The Antolik
 decision quotes the following passage with approval to explain
 the distinction between goodwill of a business and personal
 goodwill:
 
[W]here goodwill is a marketable business asset distinct
from the personal reputation of a particular individual, as
is usually the case with many commercial enterprises, that
goodwill has an immediately discernible value as an asset of
the business and may be identified as an amount reflected in
a sale or transfer of such business. On the other hand, if
goodwill depends on the continued presence of a particular
individual, such goodwill, by definition, is not a
marketable asset distinct from the individual. Any value
which attaches to the entity solely as a result of personal
goodwill represents nothing more than probable future
earning capacity, which, although relevant in determining
alimony, is not a proper consideration in dividing marital
property in a dissolution proceeding.
 
21 The family court also relied on the analysis as to personal goodwill
in Weinberg v. Dickson-Weinberg, 121 Hawai' i 401, 220 P.3d 264 (App. 2009),
vacated in part, aff'd in part, 123 Hawai' i 68, 229 P.3d 1133 (2010). That 
portion of Weinberg, however, was later vacated by the Hawai' i supreme court. 
14
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
7 Haw. App. at 318, 761 P.2d at 308-09 (citation omitted)
 
(emphasis added).
 
Here, there is nothing in the Dental Sale Agreement
 
that required Husband's continued presence as part of the dental
 practice that he sold. Indeed, although Husband argues that he
 helped to transition patients and left his name on the office
 door for a period of time, he admitted that the Dental Sale
 Agreement did not obligate him to do such things. Therefore,
 because there was nothing in the Dental Sale Agreement that
 required Husband's continued presence related to the dental
 practice, there is no evidence to support allocating part of the
 sale to his personal goodwill. Moreover, as expressly provided
 by the stipulation between the parties, the family court was not
 bound by the allocation of the purchase price set forth in the
 agreement.
 
Thus, ultimately, the family court did not err in
 
considering the entirety of the dental practice sales price as a
 marital asset.
 
D. Motion for Reconsideration
 
Husband contends the family court erred in denying his 
post-decree motion for reconsideration. A trial court's ruling 
on a motion for reconsideration is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Tagupa v. Tagupa, 108 Hawai
'i 459, 465, 121 P.3d 
924, 930 (App. 2005). 
A motion for reconsideration is a party's opportunity
 
to present new evidence and/or arguments that could not have been
 presented during the trial. See id. Reconsideration is not an
 
avenue to relitigate issues or to raise arguments or evidence
 that could and should have been brought during trial. See id. 
Husband's memorandum in support of the motion for reconsideration
 indicates no new evidence or arguments that could not have been
 raised at trial. The family court did not abuse its discretion
 in denying the motion.

II. Wife's Cross-Appeal
A. Deviation from Partnership Model Division
 
On cross-appeal, Wife contends that the family court 
abused its discretion in decreasing the equalization payment by 
roughly $65,000. Husband does not address this argument in his answering brief.
22 An appellee need not respond to each point 
raised in the opening brief. Omerod v. Heirs of Kaheananui, 116 
Hawai'i 239, 268, 172 P.3d 983, 1012 (2007). In such an 
instance, reversal is not automatic as appellant still must convince the appellate court that reversible error occurred. Id. 
at 268-69, 172 P.3d at 1012-13. 
Marital property is divided according to the Marital 
Partnership Model. Gussin v. Gussin, 73 Haw. 470, 483-84, 836 
P.2d 484, 491 (1992). A court may deviate from an equal division of property if the "facts present any [valid and relevant considerations] authorizing a deviation from the Partnership Model Division . . . ." Schiller, 120 Hawai
'i at 287, 205 P.3d 
at 552. If the facts present relevant considerations authorizing deviation, the court must next decide whether or not to deviate from an equal division and the extent of that deviation. Id. 
Whether the facts authorize deviation is a question of law reviewed under the right/wrong standard. Id. The court's 
decision to deviate and the extent of the deviation is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Id. 
In the June 3, 2010 oral announcement of the family
 
court's ruling on Wife's motion to correct and clarify the
 decision, the court explained its decision to deviate from an
 equal distribution of property as follows: "[G]iven the
 anticipated increase in value of the property which she owns,
 that should offset the discrepancy. It's essentially the basis. 
So there's going to be a deviation of about 65,000." In FOF 121,
 
22 Husband rephrases the issue as a broader question of whether the
court erred in the "Property Division Allocation and Equalization" and only
reiterates arguments from his opening and reply briefs in his appeal. 
16
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the family court expounded on several "valid and relevant
 
considerations" upon which it based its decision to deviate: 
(1) the age of the parties in that Husband is slightly older
than Wife, (2) the respective needs of the parties and the
circumstances that they are left in following the Courts
(sic) decision, (3) their actual respective financial
conditions in that a significant portion of the computation
in the property division chart were based on credits taken
against Husband for funds previously spent and ordered
against him by prior Court orders (put another way: while
based on accounting type principles Husband showed a very
large "credit", said credit did not reflect monies that were
actually payable from one party to another), (4) Wife was
awarded an asset that may have a better likelihood of
appreciation (the condominium) as opposed to the award to
Husband of a boat, which has less of a likelihood of
appreciation by their inherent natures, and (5) the fact
that Wife will have an actual larger amount of liquid assets
available to her.
 
Wife acknowledges some of the grounds for deviation
 
stated in the family court's "Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
 
Law" are valid considerations. However, Wife contends that the
 disparity between the parties was not significant enough to
 warrant deviation. Therefore, Wife argues the family court erred
 in deviating and in the extent to which it deviated from an equal
 division. 
First, Wife contends that possible appreciation of 
property is too speculative for a court to consider, citing to Jackson v. Jackson, 84 Hawai
'i 319, 933 P.2d 1353 (App. 1997), 
for the proposition that a court can only consider post-divorce occurrences if they are more or less certain to occur. Jackson 
dealt with a different situation, the tax ramifications from the sale of assets, and is thus not dispositive. In our view, although the consideration of future appreciation of real property is not impermissible per se, the family court has neither explained its implicit conclusion that such appreciation is not already included in the fair market values of the condominium and the Prowler, nor indicated how any potential future appreciation of the condominium supports the amount of the deviation. In sum, there is no finding or explanation for how possible appreciation of Wife's property supports reducing the 
17
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
equalization payment by $65,000, and thus remand on this issue is
 
warranted.
 
Second, Wife argues the family court did not properly 
consider Husband's unauthorized withdrawals and advances as part of his liquid assets. Outside of the basic consideration of partnership principles (i.e., money put into a partnership), the focus of the property division is the present and future under HRS § 580-47. Jackson, 84 Hawai
'i at 333, 933 P.2d at 1367. 
Husband's past expenditures are not liquid assets because the money has been spent and is not presently transferable. It was within reason for the family court to not consider such money a liquid asset. Wife has failed to show how the family court abused its discretion in its consideration of liquid assets. 
Lastly, Wife contends that the family court abused its
 
discretion in its treatment of the parties' ages and their needs
 moving forward. Wife argues Husband's earning potential as a
 retired dentist is drastically higher than hers as a part-time
 employee earning $15 per hour, and based on the court's
 allocation of debt on the marital residence, she is saddled with
 a larger portion of the debt. However, while the court can
 contemplate Husband's future earnings, the court properly
 considered that, given her age, Wife can work. The court found
 that although Wife testified to physical and emotional conditions
 which limited her earning potential, she maintained a fairly
 active lifestyle as a volunteer, worked as of trial, and earned
 social security benefits of almost $900. Wife makes no
 meritorious argument that such findings are clearly erroneous. 
Also, a review of the property division chart indicates the
 equalization payment from Husband to Wife was roughly equal to
 the debt on the marital residence under which Wife was now
 burdened. Thus, her ongoing needs would mostly be her living
 expenses, which the court found she could meet with her available
 resources (which include income, marital residence, and a
 Fidelity Investments account). While Husband received more in
 social security benefits each month (approximately $2,000), and
 
18
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
potentially earns more money if in the work force, at the time of
 
trial, he had retired from practice. There is nothing inherently
 problematic in the family court's expectation that both parties
 probably would engage in post-divorce income producing activity
 to remain self-sufficient. 
With regard to the family court's deviation from the
 
Partnership Model, we thus remand to the family court on the
 issue of possible future appreciation of Wife's property.
B. Post-Decree Alimony
 
Wife's other argument on cross-appeal is that the
 
family court abused its discretion in denying her post-decree
 
alimony. Wife's basic contention is that it is inequitable that
 Wife must work, perhaps full-time, to meet her needs, while
 Husband can remain retired to meet his. 
In Wong v. Wong, 87 Hawai
'i 475, 960 P.2d 145 (App. 
1998), this court identified the main factual questions in
 deciding issues of alimony:
 
[T]he first relevant circumstance is the payee's need. What
amount of money does he or she need to maintain the standard
of living established during the marriage? The second
relevant circumstance is the payee's ability to meet his or
her need without spousal support. Taking into account the
payee's income, or what it should be, including the net
income producing capability of his or her property, what is
his or her reasonable ability to meet his or her need
without spousal support? The third relevant circumstance is
the payor's need. What amount of money does he or she need
to maintain the standard of living established during the
marriage? The fourth relevant circumstance is the payor's
ability to pay spousal support. Taking into account the
payor's income, or what it should be, including the income
producing capability of his or her property, what is his or
her reasonable ability to meet his or her need and to pay
spousal support?
 
* * *
 
When answering any of the above questions, the
following two rules apply: Any part of the payor's current
inability to pay that was unreasonably caused by the payor
may not be considered and must be ignored. Any part of the
payee's current need that was caused by the payee's
violation of his or her duty to exert reasonable efforts to
attain self-sufficiency at the standard of living
established during the marriage may not be considered and
must be ignored.
 
19
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION  IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Id. at 485, 960 P.2d at 155 (citations omitted). Looking at the
 
relevant factors and questions, Wife has failed to demonstrate
 the family court abused its discretion in denying her alimony. 
Related to its alimony determination, the family court
 
found the following: (1) at the time of trial, Husband received
 approximately $2,000 a month in social security benefits as his
 only income, whereas wife received $900 a month in social
 security benefits plus income from a $15 per hour part-time job; 
(2) despite claimed medical conditions, Husband has the continued
 ability to work, even as a part-time or fill-in dentist; (3)
 despite claimed medical conditions, Wife maintains a fairly
 active lifestyle; (4) Husband claims to reside on Prowler; and
 (5) although Wife appears not to have the ability to meet her
 stated needs independently, she would have sufficient resources
 based on the property division to meet her actual reasonable
 needs. In the property division, the court awarded Wife inter
 alia the marital residence valued at $480,600 (burdened with two
 mortgages), and $332,786.70 in liquid assets after the $200,000
 equalization payment from Husband. Husband received $310,716.62
 in liquid assets after the equalization payment, Prowler valued
 at $180,000, and credit for all the funds he already received
 throughout the proceedings. Each party retained a Fidelity
 Investments account (Husband's totaled $272,408, and Wife's
 totaled $107,476.95).
 
Therefore, the court awarded Wife more liquid assets
 
and a valuable marital residence as a basis upon which to
 maintain her lifestyle. Combined with Wife's apparent ability to
 work, the family court reasonably found that Wife possessed
 enough resources to meet her needs. Moreover, the consideration
 that Husband was unable to pay alimony because he retired from
 practice was reasonable.
 
The assessment of the weight and credibility of
 
evidence lay within the sound discretion of the family court. 
Wife has failed to demonstrate the family court abused its
 discretion.

III. Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the "Order re Plaintiff's
 
Motion for Pre-Decree Relief (Filed November 16, 2007)" filed on
 
February 5, 2008; the "Order re Motion to Find Defendant in
 Contempt" filed on March 13, 2008; the "Order re Motion to

 December 28, 2009" filed April 14, 2010; and the "Order Denying
 Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration Filed July 6, 2010" filed
 August 3, 2010, are all affirmed.
 
We vacate the family court's Findings of Fact 120 and
 
121 and Conclusions of Law 34 and 37(7) in "Findings of Fact and
 Conclusions of Law" filed on October 28, 2010, and any decision
 of the family court based upon them, to the extent that they rely
 on the potential appreciation of the marital residence as a basis
 to decrease the equalization payment from $265,062.31 to
 $200,000. Accordingly, we vacate the "Order re Plaintiff's
 Motion to Correct and Clarify Decision" filed June 7, 2010, and
 the "Decree Granting Absolute Divorce" filed June 24, 2010, to
 the extent each incorporates the family court's deviation in the
 equalization payment. We remand to the family court for further
 proceedings on the issue of deviation in the equalization
 payment, consistent with this opinion.
