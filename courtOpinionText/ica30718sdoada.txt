On July 2, 2010, the date of trial, Yamahata filed and
 
argued a motion to dismiss, asserting, inter alia, that the
 
failure to allege state of mind, an essential fact, deprived the
 
district court of jurisdiction. At the conclusion of a
 
stipulated facts trial, the district court found Yamahata guilty
 
under HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and (3) and entered its judgment of
 
conviction. This timely appeal followed.
 
On appeal, Yamahata contends that the district court 
erred in denying his motion to dismiss the defective charge which 
omitted the requisite state of mind for the offense, an essential 
fact required under Rule 7(d) of the Hawai' i Rules of Penal 
Procedure, thereby depriving the court of jurisdiction, and that the district court consequently erred in convicting him on the 
defective charge. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
conclude that the complaint was not required to allege a mens rea 
in order to be sufficient, and we reject Yamahata's challenge to 
the sufficiency of the complaint. State v. Nesmith, __ Hawai' i 
__, __ P.3d __ (App. 2011); No. CAAP-10-0000072, 2011 WL 2685719 (App. Jun. 22, 2011). Consequently, the district court did not 
err in denying the motion to dismiss and in convicting Yamahata. 
Therefore, the District Court of the First Circuit,
 
Honolulu Division's August 11, 2010 Order and Notice of Entry of
 
Order is affirmed.
 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai' i, August 22, 2011.
