STATE OF HAWAI 'I, Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.
 
ALEJANDRO PADILLA, Defendant-Appellant.
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
WAI'ANAE DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTA-10-00147)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., and Leonard, J.,
with Ginoza, J., concurring separately)
 
Defendant-Appellant Alejandro Padilla (Padilla) appeals
 
from the Judgment filed on July 21, 2010, in the District Court
 
of the First Circuit (District Court).1 Padilla was charged by
 
complaint with operating a vehicle under the influence of an
 intoxicant (OVUII), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3) (Supp. 2009), as a first-time
 offender under HRS § 291E-61(b)(1) (Supp. 2009) and/or as a
 highly intoxicated driver under HRS § 291E-61(b)(2) (Supp. 2009). 
Prior to trial, Padilla filed a Motion to Dismiss Re:
 
Failure to Allege an Essential Fact (Motion to Dismiss), seeking
 to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was deficient for
 failure to allege a mens rea. The District Court denied the

motion to dismiss. Padilla was tried, found guilty, and
 
sentenced. 
On appeal, Padilla argues that the District Court erred 
in denying his motion to dismiss because he claims the complaint was defective for failing to allege that he committed the OVUII offense intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. We conclude that the complaint was not required to allege a mens rea in order to be sufficient, and we reject Padilla's challenge to the sufficiency of the complaint. State v. Nesmith, No. CAAP-10­
0000072 (Hawai
'i App. June 22, 2011) (holding that a complaint 
which did not allege a mens rea was sufficient to charge the defendant with OVUII in violation of HRS § 291E-61(a)(1) and/or (a)(3), as a first-time offender under HRS § 291E-61(b)(1)). Accordingly, we affirm the July 21, 2010, Judgment of the District Court.
