REECE K. TAKAZONO, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
KANEOHE DIVISION
 
(CASE NO. 1DTC-10-026502)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding J., Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Reece K. Takazono (Takazono)
 
appeals from the Judgment filed on August 10, 2010 in the
 
District Court of the First Circuit, Kaneohe Division (district
 
court).1
 
The district court convicted Takazono of Reckless
 
Driving, in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 291-2
 
(2007 Repl.). 
On appeal, Takazono contends there was insufficient
 
evidence to convict him of Reckless Driving because he (1) did
 
not grossly deviate from the standard of conduct that a law-
abiding person would have observed in the same situation, (2) was
 
not aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk and therefore
 
could not have recklessly disregarded the safety of other persons

or property, and (3) did not operate his vehicle with a reckless
 
state of mind.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, as
 
well as the relevant statutory and case law, we conclude that
 
Takazono's appeal is without merit.
 
(1) Contrary to Takazono's claim, there was 
substantial evidence to support his conviction for Reckless 
Driving. State v. Matavale, 115 Hawai 'i 149, 157-58, 166 P.3d 
322, 330-31 (2007). Takazono consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that injury would result when 
he passed a stopped bus by crossing over double solid yellow 
lines in a curved part of a two-lane highway where he could not 
see directly in front of the bus. "The crossing of a double 
solid yellow line by vehicular traffic is prohibited except when 
the crossing is part of a left turn movement." HRS § 291C­
38(c)(8) (2007 Repl.). "Double lines indicate maximum 
restriction." HRS § 291C-38(b)(7). The district court found 
that Takazono crossed the double solid yellow lines dividing the 
highway where the incident took place. Takazono does not 
challenge that finding. Takazono was prohibited from crossing 
over the double solid yellow lines unless he was making a left 
turn movement. Takazono provided no reason for crossing the 
double solid yellow lines other than to get around the bus, which 
had stopped at a bus stop. Takazono admitted he could not see 
directly in front of the stopped bus. Takazono did grossly 
deviate from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person 
would have observed in the same situation when he crossed double 
solid yellow lines to pass a stopped bus on a two-lane highway 
where he could not see in front of the bus. HRS § 702-206(3) 
(1993). 
(2) Takazono admitted that he saw the stopped bus as
 
he approached and believed he could still pass the bus. Yet, at

the same time, he admitted that he could not see directly in
 
front of the stopped bus. Takazono was aware of the risk that he
 
could not see directly in front of the stopped bus, but he
 
nonetheless proceeded to disregard the risk by attempting to pass
 
the bus.
 
(3) "Given the difficulty of proving the requisite 
state of mind by direct evidence in criminal cases, proof by 
circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from 
circumstances surrounding the defendant's conduct is sufficient." 
State v. Agard, 113 Hawai 'i 321, 324, 151 P.3d 802, 805 (2007) 
(quoting State v. Eastman, 81 Hawai 'i 131, 141, 913 P.2d 57, 67 
(1996)). "Furthermore, appellate courts will give due deference 
to the right of the trier of fact to determine credibility, weigh 
the evidence, and draw reasonable inferences from the evidence 
adduced." Agard, 113 Hawai 'i at 324, 151 P.3d at 805 (internal 
quotation marks and citation omitted). The State adduced substantial evidence that Takazono acted with a reckless state of 
mind. 
Therefore, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Judgment filed on
 
August 10, 2010 in the District Court of the First Circuit,
 Kaneohe Division, is affirmed.
