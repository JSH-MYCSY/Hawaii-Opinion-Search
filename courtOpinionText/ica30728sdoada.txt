IN THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS
 
OF THE STATE OF HAWAI' I 
IN THE INTEREST OF MA and
 
IN THE INTEREST OF HW
 
APPEAL FROM THE FAMILY COURT OF THE SECOND CIRCUIT
 
(FC-S NOS. 05-1-0067 AND 05-1-0068)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Fujise, Presiding Judge, Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Appellant Mother ("Mother") appeals from the "Findings
 
of Fact and Conclusions of Law" and the order therein ("Order"),
 
filed on July 12, 2010, and the "Order Denying Motion for
 Reconsideration Filed July 22, 2010," filed on August 25, 2010,
 in FC-S Nos. 05-1-0067 and 05-1-0068, in the Family Court of the
 Second Circuit ("Family Court").
1 The Order awarded permanent

custody of the children  to the Hawai' i Department of Human 
Services ("DHS"). 
On appeal, Mother contends that (1) the Family Court
 
erred by finding that Mother was not currently able and willing
 to provide the children with a safe family home with the
 assistance of a service plan, that she would not be able to do so
 in the reasonably foreseeable future, and that the proposed
 permanent plan, as amended, was in the best interest of the
 children, (2) Findings of Fact ("FOF") Nos. 21, 23, 24, 25, 31,
 39, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, and 68

 The children, MA and HW, are Mother's male and female minor
children. The children's fathers were defaulted from the case on October 18,
2005 and March 20, 2007, respectively.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
are clearly erroneous and Conclusions of Law ("COL") Nos. 8, 9,
 
and 11 are wrong, and (3) the "Family Court's award of permanent
 custody seems to have been more influenced by the age of the case
 than by satisfaction of the 'clear and convincing' standard of
 H.R.S. ยง 587-73(a)." 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Mother's points of error as follows:
 
(1) It was not clearly erroneous for the Family Court
 
to find that Mother was not willing and able to provide a safe
 family home, even with the assistance of a service plan, would
 not be able to do so in the reasonably foreseeable future, and
 that the proposed permanent plan, as amended, was in the best
 interest of the children. (FOF 59, 60)
 
MA and HW were initially placed into foster care in
 
March 2005. Foster care was later revoked, and family
 supervision over MA and HW was granted, with Mother required to
 follow the requirements of a service plan, including the
 requirement that Mother "maintain a clean and sober lifestyle."
 After three months, Mother was evicted from a shelter for her
 inability to follow shelter rules. Family supervision was
 revoked, but Mother's service plan was continued. Mother
 thereafter missed drug testing (which are considered positive
 drug test results), tested positive for marijuana use, refused to
 take prescribed medication for post-traumatic stress disorder,
 failed to provide MA with his prescribed medication for attention
 deficit hyperactivity disorder, refused to submit to urinalysis
 while conceding that she would test positive, and missed
 parenting classes.
 
Mother's service plans each required that Mother
 
refrain from using illegal drugs. Even after the children were
 returned to Mother at DHS's request on July 29, 2008, the
 children were again placed into foster care on August 14, 2008
 because Mother was arrested for contempt of court. On August 18,
 2008, Mother was released from jail, but immediately tested
 positive for marijuana. On May 1, 2009, Mother admitted that she
 
2

had, until recently, continued to use marijuana on a regular
 
basis and that she did not comply with court orders that required
 that she participate in random urinalysis. As of May 1, however,
 she claimed not to be using marijuana any longer, and was taking
 prescribed medication for her sleep problems. On June 23, 2009,
 however, Mother acknowledged that her urinalysis tests were "not
 clean", and that she was continuing to use marijuana.
 
In sum, Mother failed to comply with the terms of her
 
service plans. In addition, Mother was informed that her
 continued use of marijuana would prevent her from reunification
 with her children, yet she persisted in using the drug,
 justifying it on the basis that she only used it at night and
 never in the presence of her children.
 
Although there was conflicting evidence, and although
 
Mother appeared to demonstrate an increasing level of
 understanding that she needed to follow the terms of her service
 plans over time, there was substantial evidence in support of the
 Family Court's finding, and the finding is not clearly erroneous.
 
(2) In her second point of error, Mother challenges
 
FOF nos. 21, 23, 24, 25, 31, 39, 44, 45, 46, 47, 49, 50, 52, 53,
 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, and 68 and COL nos. 8, 9, and 11. Mother is
 correct that she presented evidence regarding reasons why the
 cases should not be set for a permanent plan hearing (FOF 21),
 and that several other FOF's make no apparent findings at all
 (FOF 23-25). To the extent that these may be erroneous, however,
 they are foundational and harmless. While Mother takes issue
 with other FOFs and COLs, those objections reflect (i)
 disagreement with the words or terms used by the Family Court in
 characterizing the evidence relied upon or in crafting its
 findings/conclusions, and not their substance (e.g., FOF 31, 50,
 57), (ii) a mischaracterization of findings that Mother had not
 rebutted specific evidence as "shift[ing] the burden of proof"
 (e.g., FOF 31, 68), (iii) her contention that, while perhaps true
 at one point, they are no longer true (e.g., FOF 44-47, 52, 56),
 or (iv) are rooted in a conflicting evaluation of the balance of
 the evidence (e.g., FOF 39, 49, 53, 55). 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER
 
The challenged FOFs are not clearly erroneous. In
 
addition, the challenged COLs (COL 8, 9, 11), relate closely to
 
FOF 59 and 60, and, under the circumstances, are correctly
 decided.
 
(3) In her third point of error, Mother contends that
 
the "Family Court's award of permanent custody seems to have been
 more influenced by the age of the case than by satisfaction of
 the 'clear and convincing' standard of H.R.S. ยง 587-73(a)." 
Whether the Family Court, in fact, was more influenced by one
 factor or another cannot be established from the record. It is,
 in any event, irrelevant, as it does not, on its own, constitute
 error. Mother has not presented any argument or cases that
 support her proposition. Consequently, this point of error is
 without merit.
 
Therefore,
 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Findings of Fact and
 
Conclusions of Law, and the order therein, filed on July 12,
 2010, and the "Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration Filed
 July 22, 2010," filed on August 25, 2010, in FC-S Nos. 05-1-0067
 and 05-1-0068, in the Family Court of the Second Circuit are
 affirmed.
