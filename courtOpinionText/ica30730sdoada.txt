HEIRS AND/OR DEVISEES OF KAHALIUKUA, DECEASED, et al.,

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE THIRD CIRCUIT

SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Foley and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant pro se Brian Kaniela Nae' ole 
(Nae'ole), as one of the heirs and/or devisees of David Nae' ole, 
Deceased, appeals from the Final Judgment and Decree (Judgment)
 
filed on August 11, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the Third
 
Circuit (circuit court).1 The Judgment provides the following,
 
in relevant part:
 
1. None of the Defendants named in this paragraph 1,
who are all of the Defendants remaining in the case who have
claimed interests in the lands in this case, has set forth
specific facts in response to the . . . MOTION FOR SUMMARY
JUDGMENT [(MSJ) filed by Plaintiff-Appellee EWM Investments,
LLC (EWM)], showing that there is a genuine issue for trial,

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
so that no Defendant has raised a genuine issue as to any
material fact, and based on the evidence presented, [EWM] isentitled to a judgment as a matter of law, all as requiredby [Hawai' i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP)] Rule 56; and
these Defendants are: . . . BRIAN NAEOLE[.] 
2. [EWM] is the sole owner in fee simple absolute,
free and clear of all claims, liens, clouds and encumbrances
. . . of the parcels of real property described in Exhibit A
attached.
 
Exhibit A describes Land Commission Award No. 7542, Apana 1,
 
2
Royal Patent No. 5001 to Kahaliukua (the property)  situated on
the island of Hawai' i. 
On appeal, Nae
'ole argues the following, to the extent 
we can discern his arguments: the circuit court plainly erred or 
abused its discretion, violated his right to due process, and 
violated the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawai' i 
Rule 12 (Circuit Court Rule 12) by reinstating this case after counsel for EWM failed to timely file a Pre-Trial Statement; the 
circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear this case, which 
involved title to private property located in the Kingdom of 
Hawai'i; the circuit court plainly erred by failing "to apply the 
proper understanding of [Klinger v. Kepano, 64 Haw. 4, 635 P.2d 938 (1981),] as suggested by [EWM's counsel] in his attempt to 
confuse [Nae' ole] and [the circuit] court"; and the circuit court 
violated his right to due process by finding that he had no interest in the property, where his ancestor, David Nae' ole, was 
given no notice of a 1949 tax sale at which the property was sold. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we 
resolve Nae' ole's points of error as follows: 
(1) The circuit court was within its inherent
 
authority to overlook EWM's counsel's delay in filing a Pretrial
 
2
 Although Exhibit A described eight separate parcels of land,
Nae'ole's claim extended only to the property. 
2
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Statement and did not plainly err or violate Nae' ole's 
constitutional rights or Circuit Court Rule 12 by reinstating the 
case. See Circuit Court Rule 12; Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) 
ยง 603-21.9 (1993); Kawamata Farms, Inc. v. United Agri Products, 86 Hawai' i 214, 257, 948 P.2d 1055, 1098 (1997). 
(2) The circuit court had jurisdiction over this case,
 
a quiet title action. HRS ยง 603-21.5 (Supp. 2010). See In re
 
Determination & Declaration of Heirs of Keamo, 3 Haw. App. 360,
 366, 650 P.2d 1365, 1370 (1982); see also State by Kobayashi v.
 
Zimring, 58 Haw. 106, 114-15, 566 P.2d 725, 731 (1977).
 
(3) We fail to discern Nae' ole's arguments regarding 
"Hawaii Code Sec. 656-31, 31.5" and are not obliged to address 
those matters. Hawaii Ventures, LLC v. Otaka, Inc., 114 Hawai' i 
438, 478, 164 P.3d 696, 736 (2007). 
(4) To the extent that we understand Nae' ole's points 
with regard to Klinger, we hold the following: 
(a) If Nae'ole is arguing that the circuit court 
erroneously relied on Klinger and EWM's interpretation of Klinger in granting EWM's MSJ, Nae' ole fails to demonstrate where in the 
record the court relied on Klinger. The circuit court does not cite to that case in its order granting the MSJ, Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law, or Judgment. 
(b) If Nae'ole is arguing that Klinger supports 
his argument that his due process rights were violated when David 
Nae'ole was not given notice of the tax sale, Klinger is 
inapplicable on that point because, among other things, the court in Klinger held that its decision would only apply prospectively, 
and no lawsuit challenging the notice provided for the 1949 tax 
sale was filed before Klinger was decided in 1981. See Klinger, 
64 Haw. at 15, 635 P.2d at 946. 
(5) Nae'ole cites to no authority for the notion that 
EWM had the burden of proving that David Nae' ole was given notice 
of the tax sale, and we find none. Freitas v. Gomes, 52 Haw. 
145, 472 P.2d 494 (1970), is inapplicable because that case 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
involved distribution of real estate devised by a will, and 
Nae'ole does not argue that at the time of the tax sale, the Tax 
Collector of the Third Taxation Division of the Territory of Hawai'i knew David Nae' ole was a person interested in the property 
or his address or that the tax collector failed to attempt to ascertain such through reasonable diligence. Id. at 152, 472 
P.2d at 499. 
Therefore,
 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Final Judgment and Decree
 
filed on August 11, 2010 in the Circuit Court of the Third
 Circuit is affirmed.
