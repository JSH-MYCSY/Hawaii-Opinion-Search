STATE OF HAWAI' I, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
THOMAS H. BROWN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT
 
(CR. NO. 09-1-0720)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: 
Nakamura, C.J., Fujise and Leonard, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Thomas H. Brown (Brown) appeals
 
from the August 16, 2010 judgment entered by the Circuit Court of
 
1
 the First Circuit (circuit court),  convicting him of Electronic
Enticement of a Child in the First Degree (Electronic
 
Enticement), in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS)
 
§ 707-756 (Supp. 2010).2
 
1	 The Honorable Virginia L. Crandall presided.
 
2	 HRS § 707-756 reads now, as it did at the time of Brown's arrest:
 
(1) Any person who, using a computer or any other
electronic device:
 
(a) 	Intentionally or knowingly communicates:
 .  .  .  .
 (iii) With another person who represents
that person to be under the age of
eighteen years;
 
(b) With the intent to promote or facilitate
the commission of a felony:

At trial, the State produced logs of online chats in
 
which Brown engaged in sexually-explicit conversations with a
 
detective from the Honolulu Police Department's (HPD) Internet
 
Crimes Against Children Detail who was posing as a 14-year-old
 
girl named Shanna Lee. Brown was arrested outside a Honolulu
 
store where his online alias "antiposer69" had arranged to meet
 
"Shanna."
 
On appeal, Brown alleges the circuit court committed
 
plain error by: (1) not instructing the jury on the definition of
 
"person" stated in HRS § 707-700; (2) giving an instruction on
 
Sexual Assault in the First and Third Degrees that did not
 
conform to the statutory definitions of the crimes; and, (3) when
 
instructing the jury on Electronic Enticement, stating that
 
Defendant acted "with the intent to promote or facilitate the
 
commission of the offense[s] of Sexual Assault in the First
 
Degree or Sexual Assault in the Third Degree" that, he claims,
 
"were non-existent under these facts." Lastly, Brown contends
 
there is insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.
 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised, we resolve Brown's
 
points of error as follows:
 
(...continued)
 
.  .  .  .
 
(iii) That is another covered offense as
 
defined in section 846E-1, agrees to meet with
the minor, or with another person who represents
that person to be a minor under the age of
eighteen years; and
 
(c)	 Intentionally or knowingly travels to the agreed upon
meeting place at the agreed upon meeting time,
 
is guilty of electronic enticement of a child in the first
degree.
 
(2) Electronic enticement of a child in the first
 
degree is a class B felony. Notwithstanding any law to the
contrary, a person convicted of electronic enticement of a
child in the first degree shall be sentenced to an
indeterminate term of imprisonment as provided by law.

(1) The omission of a jury instruction defining 
"person" did not render the instructions prejudicially 
insufficient. See State v. Kassebeer, 118 Hawai' i 493, 504, 193 
P.3d 409, 420 (2008). Brown argues that the circuit court should have instructed the jury on the definition of "person" as given 
in HRS § 707-700, which defines a person as a "human being who 
has been born and is alive." His argument implies that the jury 
needed the definition of person in HRS § 707-700, to distinguish 
living human beings from fictional characters like "Shanna." 
Brown cites State v. Aiwohi, 109 Hawai' i 115, 123 P.3d 
1210 (2005), and State v. Jardine, 101 Hawai' i 3, 61 P.3d 514 
(App. 2002), for support. The issue in Aiwohi and Jardine was whether an unborn fetus could be considered a "person" under the 
Hawai'i Penal Code. These cases are not instructive here.
 Where jurors are not given the legal definitions of 
terms, it is presumed "that the jury applied the commonly 
understood meaning of those terms." Roxas v. Marcos, 89 Hawai' i 
91, 148, 969 P.2d 1209, 1266 (1998). A "person" is commonly defined as "human" or "individual." Merriam-Webster Dictionary 
924 (11th ed. 2003). This common definition is similar in substance to the definition Brown claims was missing. 
Accordingly, the instructions were not insufficient in this 
regard. 
(2) 	The court's instructions on Sexual Assault in the
 
3	 4
 First Degree  and Sexual Assault in the Third Degree,  which were
3	 HRS § 707-730 (Supp. 2009) reads:
 
Sexual assault in the first degree. (1) A person commits the
offense of sexual assault in the first degree if:
 
. . . .
 
(c)	 The person knowingly engages in sexual
penetration with a person who is at least
fourteen years old but less than sixteen years
old; provided that:
 
(i)	 The person is not less than five years older
than the minor; and

included to explain the intent element of the Electronic
 
Enticement charge, were inaccurate because they failed to
 
properly state all the elements of those crimes.
 
With Brown's agreement, the circuit court gave the 
State's proposed instructions, which included Instruction 9.44A 
and 9.49A of Hawai' i Jury Instructions Criminal (HAWJIC) with 
modifications. The first part of each instruction tracks the definition of first-degree sexual assault and third-degree sexual 
assault respectively. 
In the second part of the instructions, the HAWJIC
 
instructions were modified to enumerate elements that the State
 
needed to prove. Specifically, language in the third element of
 
each instruction was "[t]hat 'Shanna' was a person who
 
represented herself to be at least fourteen years old but less
 
than sixteen years old at that time[.]" This element was
 
inconsistent with the first part of the instructions, which
 
accurately stated the law by defining the crime of sexual assault
 
as, inter alia engaging in the prohibited conduct "with a minor
 
who is at least fourteen years old but less than sixteen years
 
old" (empahsis added). In the second part of the instructions,
 
the court instructed the jury that the State must show that Brown
 
3(...continued)
 
(ii)	 The person is not legally married to the
minor[.]
 
4	 HRS § 707-732 (Supp. 2009) reads:
 
Sexual assault in the third degree.  (1) A person commits the
offense of sexual assault in the third degree if:
 
. . . . 
(c)	 The person knowingly engages in sexual contact
with a person who is at least fourteen years old
but less than sixteen years old or causes the
minor to have sexual contact with the person;
provided that:
 
(i)	 The person is not less than five years
older than the minor; and
 
(ii)	 The person is not legally married to the
minor[.]

 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
intended to engage in sexual penetration or contact with someone
 
claiming to be 14. Such an instruction is inaccurate because
 
engaging in sexual penetration or contact with someone who claims
 
to be underage, but is not, would not satisfy the requirements
 
for sexual assault in the first or third degrees
 
(3) Brown argues that because "'Shanna' was not a 
'person' to whom the [sexual assault] statutes applied," the 
sexual-assault offenses were "nonexistent" and therefore the 
court erred in providing instructions on them. Brown cites to 
State v. Loa, which held that a jury instruction for a 
"nonexistent offense was erroneous per se." 83 Hawai' i 335, 357, 
926 P.3d 1258, 1280 (1996). Loa was found guilty of attempted reckless manslaughter, an offense not recognized under the 
Hawai'i Penal Code. Id. (citing State v. Holbron, 80 Hawai' i 27, 
43-45, 904 P.2d 912, 928-30 (1995)). First- and third-degree sexual assault, however, are crimes for which a defendant may be 
prosecuted and are therefore not "nonexistent." See, e.g., 
Kassebeer, 118 Hawai' i at 520, 193 P.3d at 436 (remanding case 
for new trial on first-degree sexual assault and kidnapping 
charges); State v. Behrendt, 124 Hawai' i 90, 237 P.3d 1156 (2010) 
(affirming conviction for third-degree sexual assault). 
Brown's argument is essentially that it would have been 
impossible for Brown to commit first- or third-degree sexual assault against "Shanna" because "Shanna" was not a real child. 
We rejected this argument in State v. Nicholson, 120 Hawai' i 480, 
484-85 & n.3 , 210 P.3d 3, 7-8 & n.3 (App. 2009). Moreover, the plain language and the legislative intent of HRS § 707-756, 
specifically subpart (1)(a)(iii), was to remove the "the defense 
of impossibility," where the alleged sex offender argues that he 
or she cannot be convicted of enticement because the person with 
whom he or she communicated was not actually a child. S. Stand. 
Comm. Rep. No. 2867, in 2002 Senate Journal, at 1384. Because 
"it was not necessary for Nicholson to actually commit one of the 
felony offenses defined in HRS § 846E-1 in order to violate the 
prohibition against the electronic enticement of a child[,]" 
5
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Nicholson, 120 Hawai' i at 485, 201 P.3d at 8, the fact that 
"Shanna" was not a real "person" under the sexual assault 
statutes is irrelevant. 
(4) The State produced substantial evidence of Brown's 
intent to facilitate the commission of prohibited sexual acts. 
We disagree with Brown that "the State had to prove, as an 
attendant circumstance of the offense, that when Brown engaged in 
the conduct with the specified state of mind of intending to 
promote or facilitate commission of [first- or third-degree 
sexual assault] offenses, that Shanna was a person within the 
ambit of the [first- and third-degree sexual assault] statutes." 
See Nicholson, 120 Hawai' i at 484, 210 P.3d at 7. 
Although "a defendant's state of mind can rarely be 
proved by direct evidence," a defendant's intent can be 
sufficiently proved "by circumstantial evidence and reasonable 
inferences arising from circumstances surrounding the defendant's 
conduct[.]" State v. Gomes, 117 Hawai' i 218, 227, 177 P.3d 928, 
937 (2008) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the transcripts of Brown's sexually-explicit online chats 
with an undercover HPD detective who told him she was 14 years 
old, evidence that Brown sent "Shanna" a photograph of his penis, 
and Brown's arrest at his and "Shanna's" agreed-upon meeting 
place are substantial evidence that Brown intended "to promote or 
facilitate the commission of a felony" enumerated in HRS 
§ 846E-1. HRS § 707-756(1)(b). Furthermore, Brown's confession, 
when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,
5 
provides "'[s]ubstantial evidence' as to every material element of the offense charged." State v. Silver, 125 Hawai' i 1, 5, 249 
P.3d 1141, 1145 (2011) (citation omitted). 
Finally, given that the jury instructions on sexual
 
assault were inaccurate, we consider whether the error was

 The circuit court held a hearing regarding the admissibility of
Brown's statement to police and concluded that Brown was advised of his rights
before making the statement, that he understood these rights, and that he
knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived them.

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Nichols, 111 
Hawai'i 327, 334, 141 P.3d 974,981 (2006) (noting, however, that 
instructional "error is not to be viewed in isolation and 
considered purely in the abstract" (bracket omitted)). "[I]n the 
light of the entire proceedings and given the effect which the 
whole record shows [them] to be entitled," the instructional 
errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. The circuit 
court did not err in instructing jurors on Electronic Enticement, the crime for which Brown was convicted, nor were jurors without 
an accurate definition of first- and third degree sexual assault. 
Brown provides no basis for concluding that the inaccurate 
portions of the jury instructions on sexual assault were 
prejudicial to him, inasmuch as his defense at trial alleged 
entrapment, which the jurors apparently rejected, and raised the 
"impossibility" defense, which this court rejected in Nicholson, 
120 Hawai' i at 484-85, 210 P.3d at 7-8. Lastly, the evidence 
supporting Brown's conviction, including his confession, is overwhelming. There is no reasonable possibility that the 
instructional errors contributed to the jury's verdict on 
Electronic Enticement. 
Therefore, the August 16, 2010 judgment of conviction
 
and sentence entered by the Circuit Court of the First Circuit is
 
affirmed.
