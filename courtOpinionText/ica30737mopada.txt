MEMORANDUM OPINION
 
(By: Nakamura, C.J., Leonard and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant-Appellant Robert G.
 
Lewis, Sr. ("Lewis") appeals from the August 30, 2010 Judgment on
 
Order Granting Defendant A. Tagami Inc's Non-Hearing Motion for
 
Haw. R. Civ. P. 54(b) Certification Directing Entry of Judgment
 
as to All Claims and All Parties in this Matter but for the Claim
 
of Partition Between Plaintiff Robert G. Lewis, Sr. and Defendant
 
Gilbert Lewis, Trustee, as Contained within Count III of
 
Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint Filed May 2, 2006, entered in
 
the Circuit Court of the First Circuit ("Circuit Court").1 We
 
affirm in part and vacate in part.
 
I. Background
 
A. Complaint
 On May 2, 2006, Lewis and Christina K. Kapono, prochein
 
2
ami for Jayna Hauoli Kapono  (collectively, "Plaintiffs"), filed
the Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint to Quiet Title, Determine
 
Right of Way, and for Judicial Partition ("Complaint"). 
Plaintiffs alleged that as of December 24, 2003, Plaintiffs were
 
in possession of and were tenants in common in fee simple of
 
individual undivided interests, along with Defendant Gilbert
 
Lewis, as Trustee of the Gilbert Lewis Revocable Living Trust
 
dated November 24, 1995, in
 
[a]ll of that certain parcel of land (being a portion of the
land(s) described in and covered by Royal Patent Number
4521, Land Commission Award Number 7765 to Kanekuapuu)
situate, lying and being at Alewa, Honolulu, City and County
of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, bearing Tax Key designation
(1) 1-7-039-003, and including a portion of that certain
parcel of land bearing Tax Key designation (1) 1-7-039-029,
containing an area of 20,967 square feet, more or less,
[hereinafter, the "Lewis Parcel"][.]
 
Plaintiffs alleged that an adjoining parcel of land, designated
 
1/
 The Honorable Rhonda A. Nishimura presided.
 
2/
 Jayna Hauoli Kapono is not named as an appellant.
 
2
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
as TMK No. (1) 1-7-039-029 ("Tagami Parcel"), was claimed by
 
Defendant/Counterclaimant-Appellee A. Tagami, Inc. ("Tagami") and
 
that, at one point, the Lewis Parcel and the Tagami Parcel
 
constituted "a portion of an original kuleana parcel designated
 
as Royal Patent No. 4521, Land Commission Award 776 to
 
Kanekuapuu." Plaintiffs alleged that, through mesne conveyances,
 
the Lewis Parcel "became landlocked without a permanent right of
 
way for vehicular access to a government road over the adjoining
 
parcel[.]" 
Plaintiffs asserted three counts, seeking (I) to quiet
 
title to the Lewis Parcel; (II) an award of a vehicular right of
 
way over the Tagami Parcel pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes
 
("HRS") § 7-1 and a permanent easement by necessity in and to
 
such right of way; and (III) a partition of the Lewis Parcel if
 
any other party is found to own the Lewis Parcel with Plaintiffs.
 
B.	 Motion on Count II 
On July 24, 2009, Tagami filed a motion for partial 
dismissal of the Complaint, or, in the alternative, for partial 
summary judgment ("MPSJ-II"), asking the Circuit Court to 
determine that it was either entitled to dismissal (pursuant to 
Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure ("HRCP") Rule 12(b)(6)) or 
summary judgment on Count II of the Complaint. Tagami argued
 that on or about June 7, 1989, Lewis, Gilbert Lewis, and Gloria
 
A. Lewis ("1989 Lewis Plaintiffs") filed a lawsuit against Tagami
 
and others ("1989 Tagami Defendants") seeking an easement by
 
necessity over and across the 1989 Tagami Defendants' property. 
The 1989 Tagami Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing
 
that the easement issue had previously been litigated in Tagami
 
v. Meyer, 41 Haw. 484 (Haw. Terr. 1956), and that relitigating
 
the issue was barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel. 
The 1989 Lewis Plaintiffs opposed the motion on the grounds that
 
they were entitled to an easement by necessity or an easement
 
under HRS § 7-1. Treating the motion to dismiss as a motion for
 
3
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
summary judgment, the trial court granted the motion on
 
January 12, 1990. 
The 1989 Lewis Plaintiffs filed a motion for
 
reconsideration on January 24, 1990 and argued, among other
 
things, that the 1989 Tagami Defendants were on notice that the
 
Lewises had expended substantial sums on improvements in reliance
 
on the use of the Tagami's roadway, creating an irrevocable
 
license. The trial court granted the motion for reconsideration
 
on July 9, 1990, stating in relevant part: "The sole basis for
 
the Lewises' claim is the doctrine of irrevocable license. 
Plaintiffs are entitled to proceed with this theory and to take
 
discovery along the lines that will support their legal claim to
 
such license." 
However, pursuant to a Release and Indemnification
 
Agreement dated March 24, 1992, the 1989 Lewis Plaintiffs,
 
including Lewis, agreed with the 1989 Tagami Defendants to the
 
following pertinent terms:
 
7. Release. For and in consideration of the
 
execution of the License Agreement . . ., [the 1989 Lewis
Plaintiffs] hereby releases, remises and forever discharges
[the 1989 Tagami Defendants] from and on account of any and
all claims, actions, causes of action, claims for relief,
liability, liabilities, costs, expenses, compensations,
fees, demands, injuries, losses, loss of services, loss of
profits, exemplary damages, punitive damages and damages of
whatever name or nature, whether at law or in equity, from
the beginning of the world to the date of this Release,
including but not limited to, any manner arising, arisen,
growing out of, connected with or in any manner involving,
concerning or relating to any of the following:
 
a. [The 1989 lawsuit.]
 
b. That certain private driveway located on
that certain residential property located at 721A Panui
Street . . . (hereinafter, "Subject Driveway").
 
c. Any and all claims which were brought or
could have been brought against [the 1989 Tagami Defendants]
in connection with [the 1989 lawsuit] and/or the Subject
Driveway, including any claim concerning or relating to an
easement of whatever kind or nature, irrevocable license,
and/or any other interest in the Subject Driveway.
 
. . . .
 
9. Understandings and Agreements. [The Lewis
Plaintiffs] acknowledge, agree and understand that:
 
4
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
. . . .
 
d. Complete Bar. Acceptance of the
consideration above mentioned and execution of this Release
 
is a complete and final bar to any and all claims, actions,
causes of action, claims for relief, liability, liabilities,
costs, expenses, fees, demands, injuries, losses, and
damages of whatever name or nature against [the 1989 Tagami
Defendants] in any manner arising, growing out of, connected
with or in any manner involving, concerning or relating to
the matters covered by this Release; and this Release
forever and finally compromises, settles and terminates any
and all disputes, claims, claims to title, claims to an
interest, claims for injury, loss, damage, costs, expenses
and fees of whatever nature, known or unknown, in any manner
arising, growing out of, connected with or in any manner
involving, concerning or relating to the matters covered by
this Release.
 
The License Agreement, also dated March 24, 1992, gave the
 
Lewises a "license to the non-exclusive use of the Subject
 
Driveway . . . solely for the purposes of vehicular and
 
pedestrian ingress and egress," which could generally not be
 
revoked for twenty-five years from the date of the License
 
Agreement, but which is freely revocable after twenty-five years. 
As a result of this settlement, the parties filed a Stipulation
 
for Dismissal with Prejudice of All Claims and Parties
 
("Stipulation for Dismissal with Prejudice"). 
In the instant case, Tagami argues that, as a result of
 
the Stipulation for Dismissal with Prejudice in the 1989 lawsuit,
 
Count II was barred by res judicata. In opposition, Lewis argued
 
that the Lewis and Tagami Parcels originally comprised a part of
 
the same kuleana parcel identified in Land Commission Award No.
 
7765 to Kanekuapuu. Lewis argued, among other things, that he
 
possessed "kuleana rights to a right of way under [HRS] § 7-1"
 
and that Tagami cannot "dispossess Plaintiff and Defendant
 
Gilbert Lewis of their inherent right to a right of way as lawful
 
owners of kuleana land." 
On September 15, 2009, the Circuit Court granted the
 
MPSJ-II. 
C. Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Count I
 
On September 1, 2009, Tagami filed a motion for partial
 
5
  NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
summary judgment re: Count I of the Complaint ("MPSJ-I"). Tagami
 
argued that "Tagami, through the actions of it and its
 
predecessors in interest the Tagami family, since the year 1937,
 
has openly, exclusively and continuously possessed the Tagami
 
[Parcel], including the disputed 2,376 sq. ft. 'notched piece'
 
identified in Exhibit 'A' to the Plaintiffs' . . . Complaint." 
Tagami presented record evidence that, among other things, the
 
notched piece ("Notched Piece") had been occupied and used by the
 
Tagami family since 1937; that the Tagami family had paid
 
property taxes on the Notched Piece since 1937; that in 1952, the
 
Tagami family moved to the Tagami Parcel, cleaned up the Notched
 
Piece, and added rocks to a preexisting line of rocks marking the
 
boundary between the Lewis and Tagami Parcels, with the Notched
 
Piece lying on the Tagami side of the line of rocks; that since
 
1952, the Tagamis have maintained and cleaned the Notched Piece
 
and, in the 1990s, hired help to clean the Notched Piece monthly;
 
and that in 1991, a Tagami family member stored a car frame and
 
some tires on the south side of the Notched Piece and "whenever
 
there was a special get together, such as for Christmas Party,
 
[the Tagamis] would park cars in the area." 
In opposition, Lewis argued that Tagami was not 
entitled to summary judgment on the issue of paper title, 
claiming that the case involves "a complex chain of title and 
cannot be determined by way of summary judgment." Lewis also 
argued that Tagami was not entitled to summary judgment via 
adverse possession because Tagami's facts "are simply not enough 
to confer on . . . Tagami title by adverse possession." Among 
other things, Lewis contended that the rocks separating the 
Tagami and Lewis Parcels were not a boundary line but an ' auwai, 
or watercourse. 
In his Affidavit, Lewis claimed, among other things,
 
that the Notched Piece had been the subject of prior litigation,
 
see Tagami, 41 Haw. 484, that the parties had argued over who
 
would maintain the Notched Piece, that fences erected by the
 
6
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
Tagamis were repeatedly taken down, that the Notched Piece had 
not been developed, that Lewis and his predecessors in interests 
had repeatedly asserted that they own the Notched Piece, and that 
the line of rocks was an ' auwai bed in which the Lewis family 
also placed rocks. 
On October 29, 2009, the Circuit Court entered findings
 
of fact, conclusions of law, and the order granting the MPSJ-I. 
On August 30, 2010, the Circuit Court amended the October 29,
 
2009 findings of fact, conclusions of law and order granting the
 
3
MPSJ-I,  and held that Tagami had established ownership of the
Notched Piece through adverse possession. 
D. Judgment
 
On August 30, 2010, the Circuit Court entered judgment
 
in favor of Tagami and against Lewis on Counts I and II of the
 
Complaint, stating, among other things, that Tagami owned the
 
Notched Piece and that Lewis had "no right to vehicular access
 
across the Tagami Property." This appeal followed.
 
II. Points of Error
 
Lewis argues that the Circuit Court erred in (A)
 
granting the MPSJ-II and (B) granting the MPSJ-I. 
III. Standards of Review

file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there
is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the
moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A
 fact is material if proof of that fact would have the effect
of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of
a cause of action or defense asserted by the parties. The
 evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party. In other words, we must view all of the
evidence and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light
most favorable to the party opposing the motion.

(2005) (brackets omitted) (quoting Haw. Cmty. Fed. Credit Union 
v. Keka, 94 Hawai' i 213, 221, 11 P.3d 1, 9 (2000)). 
IV. Discussion
 
A. The Circuit Court did not err in granting the MPSJ-II
 Lewis argues that his claim to a right of way under HRS 
§ 7-1 is not barred by res judicata. "Res judicata prohibits a 
party from relitigating a previously adjudicated claim or cause 
of action." Smallwood v. City & Cnty. of Honolulu, 118 Hawai' i 
139, 147, 185 P.3d 887, 895 (App. 2008). The party asserting res 
judicata, commonly referred to as claim preclusion, has the 
burden of establishing that "(1) there was a final judgment on 
the merits, (2) both parties are the same or in privity with the 
parties in the original suit, and (3) the claim decided in the 
original suit is identical with the one presented in the action 
in question." Bremer v. Weeks, 104 Hawai' i 43, 54, 85 P.3d 150, 
161 (2004). For preclusive effect, 
[t]he judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is a bar
to a new action in any court between the same parties or
their privies concerning the same subject matter, and
 precludes the relitigation, not only of the issues which
 were actually litigated in the first action, but also of all
 
grounds of claim and defense which might have been properly
 litigated in the first action but were not litigated or
 decided.
 
Foytik v. Chandler, 88 Hawai' i 307, 314, 966 P.2d 619, 626 (1998) 
(emphasis added) (quoting Morneau v. Stark Enters., 56 Haw. 420, 
422–23, 539 P.2d 472, 474–75 (1975)). 
Res judicata precludes relitigation of Count II,
 
relating to a claim to a right of way, because that claim is
 
8
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER 
identical to the claim resolved by the 1989 lawsuit. Tagami has
 
established all the elements of res judicata. First, the 1989
 
lawsuit concluded with a final judgment on the merits—the
 
Stipulation for Dismissal with Prejudice. See In re Herbert M.
 
Dowsett Trust, 7 Haw. App. 640, 645, 791 P.2d 398, 402 (App.
 
1990) (stating that a "stipulation of dismissal with prejudice
 
constitutes a final judgment on the merits for the purpose of res
 
judicata" (quoting Sullivan v. Easco Corp., 662 F. Supp. 1396,
 1408 (D. Md. 1987)); McCandless Land & Cattle Co. v.
 Kealohapauole, No. 28292, 2011 WL 5433773, at *8 (Haw. Ct. App.
 
Nov. 9, 2011) ("[A] dismissal with prejudice 'is an adjudication
 
on the merits of all issues that were raised or could have been
 
raised in the pleadings'." (quoting Pedrina v. Chun, 906 F.Supp.
 
1377, 1401 (D.Haw. 1995)).
5 Second, the parties in this case on
 
appeal—Lewis and Tagami—were parties in the 1989 litigation. 
Third, the claim addressed by the 1989 lawsuit is
 
identical to the claim at hand; viz. whether the Lewises have a
 right of way over the Tagami's land. The Lewises could have
 
originally asserted HRS § 7-1 as an alternative basis for seeking
 
a right of way.
6 Therefore, they are precluded from advancing
 
such a claim now. Charles Alan Wright & Mary Kay Kane, Law of
 
Federal Courts § 100A, at 724 (7th ed. 2011) (claim preclusion
 
"extinguish[es] a claim by the plaintiff against the defendant
 
even though the plaintiff is prepared in the second action to
 
present evidence or grounds or theories of the case not presented
 
in the first action, or to seek remedies or forms of relief not
 
5/
 Here, the parties' Release and Indemnification Agreement,
conditioned on the Stipulation for Dismissal with Prejudice, barred all future
actions regarding the Lewises' rights to passage over the Tagami's land.
Treating this stipulation as having preclusive effect is therefore also
consistent with the position that where, as here, the claim is resolved by a
consent judgment, the parties' intent as maintained therein determines the
judgment's preclusive effect. See 18A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller,
Federal Practice and Procedure § 4443, at 262 (2002) ("The basically
contractual nature of consent judgments has led to general agreement that
preclusive effects should be measured by the intent of the parties."). 
6/
 And, in fact, they did so, albeit not until responding to the 1989
Tagami Defendants' motion to dismiss in the 1989 lawsuit.
 
9
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
demanded in the first action").
 
Lewis's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. 
Lewis contends that HRS § 7-1 was not litigated in the case
 
culminating with the Supreme Court's decision in Tagami, 41 Haw.
 
484. This argument fails as the issue could have been properly
 
litigated in the 1989 case.
 
Lewis also argues that a right of way under HRS § 7-1 
is an inalienable right and submits that such right of way is 
"not extinguishable by application of the common law principle of 
res judicata or by release relied upon by the lower court in 
granting Tagami's [MPSJ-II]." We disagree to the extent that we 
hold that right-of-way claims brought under HRS § 7-1 are subject 
to the doctrine of res judicata.7 In Bremer, a plaintiff claimed 
a right of way to and from a kuleana pursuant to HRS § 7-1. 104 
Hawai'i at 48, 85 P.3d at 155. The trial court held that the 
claim was barred by res judicata. Id. at 49, 85 P.3d at 156. 
The supreme court applied the res judicata analytical framework, but ultimately held that "the right of access . . . is not a 
claim which might have been properly litigated in the quiet title 
action." Id. at 54, 85 P.3d at 161. It reasoned that when the 
prior quiet-title action was being litigated, "there was no 
dispute regarding access to the kuleana" and right-of-access 
claims "would not have supported the claim of title to the 
kuleana itself which was the subject of the quiet title action." 
Id. at 55, 85 P.3d at 162. Bremer, therefore, supports the 
position that rights under HRS § 7-1 are not immune from res 
judicata effect. Were that not so, a party could simply reassert 
an HRS § 7-1 claim over and over again. 
Good policy likewise dictates that claims brought under
 
HRS § 7-1 are subject to claim preclusion. Considering HRS § 7-1
 
in light of the purposes of res judicata suggests nothing about
 
7/
 Whether a right of way under HRS § 7-1 is inalienable does not
speak to the issue of whether a given claim is barred by res judicata, a
procedural mechanism which can affect the bringing of claims involving
"inalienable" rights.
 
10
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
the statute that should accord it special protection. As the
 
supreme court has stated,
 
The purpose of the doctrine of res judicata is to
prevent a multiplicity of suits and to provide a limit to
litigation. It serves to relieve parties of the cost and
vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources,
and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage
reliance on adjudication. The res judicata doctrine thus
furthers the interests of litigants, the judicial system and
society by bringing an end to litigation where matters have
already been tried and decided on the merits. It is a rule
 of fundamental and substantial justice, of public policy and
private peace.
 
The doctrine therefore permits every litigant to have
an opportunity to try his case on the merits; but it also
requires that he be limited to one such opportunity.
Unsatisfied litigants have a remedy: they can appeal through
 
available channels. But they cannot, even if the first suit
 may appear to have been decided wrongly, file new suits.
 
E. Sav. Bank, FSB v. Esteban, 129 Hawai' i 154, 159, 296 P.3d 
1062, 1067 (2013) (emphasis added) (quoting Kauhane v. Acutron 
Co., 71 Haw. 458, 463–64, 795 P.2d 276, 278–79 (1990)). 
Lewis also argues that because a 2005 title report
 
indicates that the Tagami Parcel actually belongs to the Estate
 
of Kanekuapuu, "all previous proceedings, having not addressed
 
the fundamental issue of title in either party, do not bar a full
 
and complete adjudication in this proceeding for the
 
establishment of an easement for vehicular ingress and egress
 
. . . pursuant to § 7-1." Lewis, however, presents no authority
 
in support of this position and does not sufficiently argue how
 
the title report precludes the application of res judicata when
 
the elements of res judicata are otherwise satisfied. We hold
 
that the argument is waived. Haw. R. App. P. 28(b)(7).
 
Finally, Lewis claims that res judicata does not apply
 
"when the facts have changed or new facts have occurred that have
 
altered the legal rights and relations of the parties." 
However, Lewis fails to articulate any new or changed facts that
 
could not have been raised in the 1989 litigation. As Tagami
 
correctly notes, if there was such a meaningful new fact or
 
right, Lewis would identify it. Unable to discern one for
 
ourselves, we hold that the argument is without merit.

Bettencourt v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai' i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 
558 (1995) ("The burden is upon appellant in an appeal to show 
error by reference to matters in the record . . . ." (quoting 
Union Bldg. Materials Corp. v. The Kakaako Corp., 5 Haw. App. 
146, 151, 682 P.2d 82, 87 (1984))). 
Therefore, we conclude that Lewis fails to establish
 
that the Circuit Court erred in granting the MPSJ-II.
 
B.	 The Circuit Court erred in granting the MPSJ-I 
The Circuit Court found that Tagami's MPSJ-I ultimately 
sought title to the Notched Piece through adverse possession, not 
through paper title. 
Lewis argues that the Circuit Court erred 
in granting the MPSJ-I because genuine issues of material fact remain to be resolved on the issue of adverse possession. We 
agree. 
"It is well established that one claiming title to real 
property by adverse possession must bear the burden of proving by 
clear and positive proof each element of actual, open, notorious, 
hostile, continuous and exclusive possession for the statutory 
period." Lai v. Kukahiko
, 58 Haw. 362, 368, 569 P.2d 352, 357 
(1977) (citations omitted). "The burden of 'clear and positive 
proof' derives from the long-observed proposition that '[a]dverse 
possession is to be taken strictly, and every presumption is in 
favor of a possession in subordination to the rightful owner.'" 
Morinoue v. Roy, 86 Hawai' i 76, 81, 947 P.2d 944, 949 (1997) 
(quoting Territory v. Pai-a, 34 Haw. 722, 726 (1938)). In 
adverse possession cases, the character of possession is normally
 
a question of fact to be resolved at trial. See Pioneer Mill Co.
 
v. Dow
, 90 Hawai' i 289, 299, 978 P.2d 727, 737 (1999). In this 
case, Tagami failed to meet the heavy burden of establishing 
adverse possession at the summary judgment stage. 
Tagami failed to establish that its possession of the
 
Notched Piece was actual, open, and notorious as a matter of law. 
"Actual, open, and notorious possession is established where a
 
12
   
   NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAI 'I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER
 
claimant shows use of the land to such an extent and in such a 
manner as to put the world on notice by means so notorious as to 
attract the attention of every adverse claimant." Wailuku 
Agribusiness Co. v. Ah Sam, 114 Hawai' i 24, 33, 155 P.3d 1125, 
1134 (2007) (quoting Morinoue, 86 Hawai' i at 82, 947 P.2d at 950) 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
Here, Tagami argued that a line of rocks separated the 
Lewis and Tagami Parcels, that the Notched Piece was on the 
Tagami side of the line of rocks, and that the Tagamis added 
rocks to the existing line. While such evidence might be 
sufficient to establish actual, open, and notorious possession at 
trial, Lewis claimed that the line of rocks was not a boundary 
line but an ' auwai intended to divert the flow of water and that 
the Lewis family also put rocks in the ' auwai. Lewis's claim, 
therefore, created a dispute of material fact. Furthermore, 
Tagami's evidence that it periodically cleaned and maintained the 
Notched Piece, that a Tagami family member stored car parts on 
the Notched Piece in 1991, and that the Notched Piece was used by 
the Tagamis for parking on special occasions is not so 
substantial as to "put the world on notice by means so notorious 
as to attract the attention of every adverse claimant" as a 
matter of law.8 See Wailuku Agribusiness Co., 114 Hawai' i at 33, 
155 P.3d at 1134. 
"Ordinarily it is within the province of the jury to
 
determine from conflicting or doubtful evidence the existence of
 
facts necessary to constitute adverse possession . . . ." 
Deponte, 48 Haw. at 20, 395 P.2d at 275. While a factfinder
 
might ultimately conclude that Tagami gained title to the Notched
 
Piece through adverse possession, we hold that Tagami has failed
 
to establish this as a matter of law.

 Furthermore, "[p]ayment of taxes over the statutory period is only
one of the factors to be considered in establishing adverse possession."
Deponte v. Ulupalakua Ranch, Ltd., 48 Haw. 17, 20, 395 P.2d 273, 275 (1964).
That is, payment of taxes is not determinative as a matter of law.
