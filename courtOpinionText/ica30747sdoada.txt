JOHN L. JONES, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.
BARBARA A. VAN BALEN, Defendant-Appellant
 
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
 
(CIVIL NO. 06-1-0023)
 
SUMMARY DISPOSITION ORDER
 
(By: Foley, Presiding Judge, Fujise and Reifurth, JJ.)
 
Defendant-Appellant Barbara A. Van Balen ("Van Balen"),
 
acting pro se, appeals from the August 18, 2010 Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Arising from Hearing as to
 Commissioner's "Motion as to Commissions's Report and
 Confirmation of Sale," Filed March 18, 2010 ("Order 1"), and from
 the April 19, 2011 Order Granting "Motion for Further Hearing on
 Plaintiff's Motion to Further Instruct the Commissioner Filed
 November 1, 2010" Filed January 25, 2011 ("Order 2"). 
Both
 
orders were entered in the Circuit Court of the Fifth Circuit
 ("Circuit Court").

On appeal, Van Balen argues that she had an approved 
mortgage to complete the purchase of a parcel of property in Kaua» i owned by Van Balen and Plaintiff-Appellee John L. Jones 
("Jones") as tenants in common ("Property"), but that Jones and his attorneys conspired with Van Balen's ex-husband and his attorney to have Jones make prejudicial false statements against 
Van Balen at a June 17, 2010 telephone deposition in the case Barbara A. Van Balen v. Richard P. Van Balen, Case No. 84016-v in 
1
 The Honorable Randal G.B. Valenciano presided.
 NOT FOR PUBLICATION IN WEST'S HAWAII REPORTS OR THE PACIFIC REPORTER 
the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland ("Maryland
 
Case"). Van Balen contends that Jones's false statements caused
 Van Balen to lose her right to alimony which, in turn, caused her
 to lose financing to purchase the Property. Van Balen argues
 that the Circuit Court should hold an evidentiary hearing on
 issues relating to the Maryland Case. 
Jones does not present a substantive argument in 
response; instead, as part of his answering brief, Jones renewed his motion for dismissal of appeal and for fees, arguing that Van Balen's appeal should be dismissed due to her failure to comply with Hawai» i Rules of Appellate Procedure ("HRAP") Rule 28(b) and 
that he is entitled to recover his attorneys' fees and costs related to what he characterizes as Van Balen's frivolous appeal. 
Upon careful review of the record and the briefs
 
submitted by the parties, and having given due consideration to
 
the arguments advanced and the issues raised by the parties, we
 resolve Van Balen's appeal as follows:
 
(1) While Van Balen's opening brief fails to comply 
with many of the HRAP Rule 28(b) requirements, Hawai» i courts 
adhere to the "policy of affording litigants the opportunity to have their cases heard on the merits, where possible." Kanahele 
v. Han, 125 Hawai» i 446, 455, 263 P.3d 726, 735 (2011) (quoting 
Schefke v. Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd., 96 Hawai» i 408, 420, 
32 P.3d 52, 64 (2001) (internal quotation marks and brackets 
omitted). 
Here, the issue raised on appeal was raised below in
 
the November 18, 2010 Declaration of Barbara A. Van Balen ("Van
 
Balen Declaration"), which we construe as an opposition to
 
Jones's November 1, 2010 Motion to Further Instruct the
 Commissioner. See Anderson v. Oceanic Props., Inc.
, 3 Haw. App.
 
350, 355, 650 P.2d 612, 617 (1982) ("it is the substance of the
 pleading that controls, not its nomenclature"); State v. Liu, No.
 28433, 2008 WL 4336003, at *1 n.2 (Haw. Ct. App. Sept. 24, 2008)
 (construing pro se defendant's "Motion for Mistrial and Judgment
 of Acquittal" as a motion for new trial).

Furthermore, Jones raises a legal argument in 
opposition to Order 2.2 Order 1 confirmed the sale of the 
Property to Van Balen and extinguished Jones's claims against the 
Property subject to Van Balen closing on the Property within 45 days of the filing of Order 1. Van Balen did not close on the Property within 45 days. However, Van Balen contended in her declaration that Jones and his attorneys conspired with Van Balen's ex-husband's attorney to defame Van Balen in the Maryland Case, causing her to lose her alimony which, in turn, caused her to lose the financing she needed to close on the Property. We interpret Van Balen's argument to be that the November 1, 2010 Motion to Further Instruct the Commissioner should not have been granted because Jones and his attorneys inequitably prevented Van 
Balen from closing on the Property within 45 days of Order 1, and Jones should not be allowed to benefit from his own wrongdoing. See Sugarman v. Kapu, 104 Hawai» i 119, 124, 85 P.3d 644, 649 
(2004) (the decision whether to confirm a judicial sale made pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes § 668-14 is subject to the circuit court's equitable discretion); Lucas v. Am.-Hawaiian 
Eng'r & Constr. Co., 16 Haw. 80, 85 (Haw. Terr. 1904) ("Equity will give no relief to a party who does not come into court with clean hands."). Therefore, we will consider Van Balen's appeal on the merits. 
(2) Van Balen's arguments on appeal do not relate to
 
Order 1 but instead relate to propriety of the Circuit Court
 
issuing Order 2. Thus, Order 1 is affirmed.
 
(3) Van Balen failed to show that the Circuit Court
 
abused its discretion when it entered Order 2.

2 In making this determination, we note the general principle that
the filings and pleadings of pro se parties "should be interpreted liberally."
Dupree v. Hiraga, 121 Hawai »i 297, 314, 219 P.3d 1084, 1101 (2009); accord 
Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir. 2006) ("It is
well established that the submissions of a pro se litigant must be construed
liberally and interpreted to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest." 
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

 We note that Order 2 is not void. "Generally, the filing of a
notice of appeal divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the appealed
case." TSA Int'l, Ltd. v. Shimizu Corp., 92 Hawai »i 243, 265, 990 P.2d 713,
735 (1999) (citing State v. Ontiveros, 82 Hawai »i 446, 448-49, 923 P.2d 388,
390-91 (1996)). However, "[n]otwithstanding the general effect of the filing

When a court of equity is appealed to for relief it will not
go outside of the subject matter of the controversy, and
make its interference to depend upon the character and
conduct of the moving party in no way affecting the
equitable right which he asserts against the defendant, or
the relief which he demands.
 
The 7's Enters., Inc. v. Del Rosario, 111 Hawai» i 484, 495, 143 
P.3d 23, 34 (2006) (quoting Woodward v. Auyong, 33 Haw. 810,
 
811 12 (1936)).
 
While the Van Balen Declaration states that she could
 
present unbiased witnesses to establish that Jones lied in his
 deposition, the connection between the Maryland Case and this
 case appears to be based on nothing more than speculation and
 conjecture. The Van Balen Declaration does not indicate how Van
 Balen had personal knowledge that Jones and his attorneys
 conspired to have Jones lie in his deposition for the purpose of
 
causing Van Balen to lose her alimony,
4 which in turn would cause
 
Van Balen to lose her financing to purchase the Property, which,
 finally, would render Van Balen financially unable to comply with
 the terms of Order 1. Van Balen's argument related to matters
 which took place in litigation in Maryland, and the Van Balen
 Declaration does not suggest how she intended to prove any
 connection between the Maryland Case and this case. Thus, Van
 Balen has not shown an abuse of discretion.  See The 7's Enters.,

of a notice of appeal, the trial court retains jurisdiction to determine
matters collateral or incidental to the judgment, and may act in aid of the
appeal. 
For example, because the mere filing of a notice of appeal does not
affect the validity of a judgment, the circuit court retains jurisdiction to
enforce the judgment." Id. (citations omitted).
 
Here, in the November 26, 2008 Order Granting "[Jones's] Motion to
Confirm Arbitrator's Decision and to Appoint Commissioner" Filed August 4,
2008, the Circuit Court appointed the Commissioner "to dispose of the property
that is the subject of this suit in accordance with Hawaii Revised Statutes
Section 668-13, reserving unto the court the powers to issue further
instructions from time to time." Both Order 1 and Order 2 relate to the
 enforcement of the November 26, 2008 order  that is, to facilitate the
Commissioner's sale of the Property. The Circuit Court correctly determined
that it had jurisdiction to enter Order 2 because no stay upon Van Balen's
appeal from Order 1 was in effect. See Haw. R. Civ. P. 62(d).

 We note that Van Balen failed to present any evidence that Jones's
testimony actually caused her to lose her alimony in the Maryland Case.

(4) Van Balen's appeal was not frivolous, and we
 
decline to award damages to Jones pursuant to HRAP Rule 38.
 
Therefore, the August 18, 2012 Findings of Fact,
 
Conclusions of Law, and Order Arising from Hearing as to
 
Commissioner's "Motion as to Commissions's Report and
 Confirmation of Sale," Filed March 18, 2010 and the April 19,
 2011 Order Granting "Motion for Further Hearing on Plaintiff's
 Motion to Further Instruct the Commissioner Filed November 1,
 2010" Filed January 25, 2011 are affirmed. Jones's renewed
 motion for dismissal of appeal and for fees is denied.

 As an alternate basis for affirming Order 2, we note that on
February 24, 2010, a hearing on the Motion to Further Instruct the
Commissioner the January 25, 2011 Motion for Further Hearing on Plaintiff's
Motion to Further Instruct the Commissioner Filed November 1, 2010 was held,
and Van Balen has not provided a transcript from the hearing in which the
claims in the Van Balen Declaration could have been discussed and rejected.
Thus, Van Balen has not shown that she is entitled to relief. See Bettencourt
 
v. Bettencourt, 80 Hawai
»i 225, 230, 909 P.2d 553, 559 (1995) ("The burden is
upon the appellant in an appeal to show error by reference to matters in the
record, and he or she has the responsibility of providing an adequatetranscript.").
