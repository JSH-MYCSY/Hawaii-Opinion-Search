In the Matter of the Judiciary’s Response
to the COVID-19 Outbreak  
                                                                  
 
ORDER TEMPORARILY SUSPENDING IN PART 
HAWAI Iʻ RULES OF PENAL PROCEDURE RULE 6(a) 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J. , Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, J.J.) 
 
  On March 4, 2020, Governor David Ige declared a state 
of emergency in Hawaiʻ i in response to the public health threat 
posed by COVID-19.  In response to the declared state of 
emergency, the Chief Justice issued an Order on March 16, 2020, 
which, among other things, postponed non-urgent court business 
in an effort to ensure the health and safety of court personnel 
and users, and minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19 in the 
courts.   
The Committee on Operational Solutions has been 
working swiftly to formulate a plan of action to safely and 
timely return court operations to full capacity when feasible. 
Pursuant to the Chief Justice’s May 22, 2020 Order Regarding Electronically Filed
Supreme Court

 Jury Trial and Grand Juries, beginning June 1, 2020, grand jury 
proceedings may commence as directed by the chief judge of the 
respective circuit.    
Under Hawaiʻ i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 6(a), 16 
members are required for a grand jury panel.  Based on the 
recommended guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention that social distancing be maintained, and with 
limited resources, the First Circuit does not have the capacity 
in Ka‘ahumanu Hale to place 16 grand jurors, as well as the 
individuals required to be present while the grand jury is in session as set forth under Hawaiʻ i Rules of Penal Procedure Rule 
6(d), in the same space and allow for social distancing.   
Therefore, in order to protect the health and safety 
of Judiciary personnel, jurors, and court users consistent with 
the recommendations of public health authorities, while 
maintaining court operations during the COVID-19 pandemic 
without unnecessary delay, and pursuant to Article VI, section 7 
of the Hawaiʻ i Constitution and Hawaiʻ i Revised Statutes §§ 602-
5(a)(6) and 612-27, 
  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, as to the First Circuit, 
effective the date of this order and continuing until July 31, 
2020, the requirements set forth in 
Hawaiʻi Rules of Penal 
Procedure Rule 6(a) regarding the number of members of a grand 
jury is temporarily reduced from 16 members to 12 members.  This 3
order does not otherwise modify the requirements of Hawai ʻi Rules
of Penal Procedure Rule 6.     
Dated:  Honolulu, Hawaiʻ i, June 5, 2020.
