BERNICE MAU, Clerk of the City and County of Honolulu,
Defendant.
 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND JUDGMENT
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, Acoba, and Duffy, JJ.
and Circuit Judge Kim, assigned by reason of vacancy)
 
We have considered Plaintiff Khistina Caldwell DeJean’s
 
Election Complaint, Defendant Bernice Mau’s motion to dismiss or
 
for summary judgment, and the affidavit and exhibits appended to
 each. Having heard this matter without oral argument and in
 accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b) (2009) (requiring the supreme
 court to “give judgment fully stating all findings of fact and of
 law” and “decide what candidate was nominated or elected”), we
 set forth the following findings of fact and conclusions of law
 and enter the following judgment.
 
FINDINGS OF FACT
 
1. Plaintiff Khistina Caldwell DeJean was one of eight
 
candidates for the office of mayor of the City and County of
 Honolulu in the September 18, 2010 special vacancy election.
 
2. The election results for Honolulu mayor were: (1)
 
Peter Carlisle: 80,553 votes; (2) Kirk Caldwell: 71,815 votes;
 (3) Panos Prevedouros: 38,439 votes; (4) Rod Tam: 3,036 votes;
 (5) Khistina DeJean: 761 votes; (6) Philmund Lee: 642 votes; (7)
 Calvin Griffin: 582 votes; and (8) John Andrew McLeod: 391 votes.
 23. Plaintiff DeJean challenged the election results by
filing a complaint in the office of the clerk of the supreme
court on September 27, 2010, the sixth day after the September
18, 2010 special vacancy election.  Plaintiff DeJean was in the
office of the clerk of the supreme court before 4:30 p.m. on
September 27, 2010 and remained in the office for an hour to
complete her election contest complaint.  The office of the clerk
remained open for business until plaintiff DeJean completed her
complaint.  The complaint was completed and filed at 5:29 p.m.
4.  The complaint contests the special vacancy election
for Honolulu mayor based on plaintiff DeJean’s allegations of the
possibility of a margin of error of “1 per 100 votes or 1 per
10,000 votes” in the Honolulu mayoral vote tabulation, the
possibility of inconsistent procedures in processing absentee and
walk-in ballots, the possibility that additional votes were
counted after final results were reported, the absence of
plaintiff DeJean’s name on the first set of absentee ballots, the
absence of certain official observers at the September 18, 2010
election, the failure of precinct officials to remind voters to
vote both sides of the ballot, the inability of voters to vote
“none” on the Honolulu mayoral ballot, and the limited media
coverage of plaintiff DeJean’s candidacy. 
5.  Plaintiff DeJean seeks judgment from the supreme
court directing a recount of the votes or a new election for
Honolulu mayor.
6.  Defendant Mau moved for dismissal of the complaint
or for summary judgment for failure to state claims upon which3relief can be granted. 
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
I.
1.  HRS § 11-173.5(a) (2009) provides that a complaint
challenging a special county election held concurrently with a
regularly scheduled primary election “shall be filed in the
office of the clerk of the supreme court not later than 4:30 p.m.
on the sixth day after the . . . election.” 
2.  Where the language of a statute is plain and
unambiguous that a specific time provision must be met, it is
mandatory and not merely directory.  Tataii v. Cronin, 119
Hawai#i 337, 339, 198 P.3d 124, 126 (2008). 
3.  While the word “shall” is generally regarded as
mandatory, in certain situations it may be given a directory
meaning.  Id.
4.  In determining whether a statute is mandatory or
directory, the intent of the legislature must be ascertained. 
Id.
5.  Legislative intent may be determined from a
consideration of the entire act, its nature, its object, and the
consequences that would result from construing it one way or the
other.  Id.  
6.  A mandatory reading of “the sixth day” provision of
HRS § 11-173.5(a) and a directory reading of the “no later than
4:30 p.m.” provision of HRS § 11-173.5(a) is consistent with the
entire act, its nature, its object, and the consequences that
would result from construing it one way or the other.  Cf. Tataii4v. Cronin, 119 Hawai #i at 339, 198 P.3d at 126.
7.  The election complaint filed on September 27, 2010
at 5:29 p.m. was filed within the time provision of HRS § 11-
173.5(a).
II.
  1.  When reviewing a motion to dismiss a complaint for
failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the
court must accept plaintiff’s allegations as true and view them
in the light most favorable to the plaintiff; dismissal is proper
only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no
set of facts in support of his or her claim that would entitle
him or her to relief.  AFL Hotel & Restaurant Workers Health &
Welfare Trust Fund v. Bosque, 110 Hawai #i 318, 321, 132 P.3d
1229, 1232 (2006).
2.  The court’s consideration of matters outside the
pleadings converts a motion to dismiss into one for summary
judgment.  Foytik v. Chandler, 88 Hawai #i 307, 313, 966 P.2d 619,
625 (1998).  Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  Estate of Doe v. Paul
Revere Ins. Group, 86 Hawai# i 262, 269-270, 948 P.2d 1103, 1110-
1111 (1997).
3.  A complaint challenging the results of an election
pursuant to HRS § 11-172 fails to state a claim unless the
plaintiff demonstrates errors, mistakes or irregularities that
would change the outcome of the election.  Tataii v. Cronin, 119
Hawai#i at 339, 198 P.3d at 126; Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai# i 383,5387, 935 P.2d 98, 102 (1997); Elkins v. Ariyoshi, 56 Haw. 47, 48,
527 P.2d 236, 237 (1974); Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. 312, 317,
651 P.2d 912, 915 (1982).
4.  A plaintiff challenging an election must show that
he or she has actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient
to change the result.  Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai #i at 339, 198
P.3d at 126; Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai #i at 388, 935 P.2d at
103; Funakoshi v. King, 65 Haw. at 316-317, 651 P.2d at 915.
5.  It is not sufficient for a plaintiff challenging an
election to allege a poorly run and inadequately supervised
election process that evinces room for abuse or possibilities of
fraud.  An election contest cannot be based upon mere belief or
indefinite information.  Tataii v. Cronin, 119 Hawai# i at 339,
198 P.3d at 126; Akaka v. Yoshina, 84 Hawai# i at 387-388, 935
P.2d at 102-103.
6.  The possible irregularities in the processing and
tabulation of the September 18, 2010 election votes do not amount
to actual information of mistakes or errors sufficient to change
the election results for Honolulu mayor.  
7.  The matters concerning election voting and media
coverage of candidates do not demonstrate that the results of the
September 18, 2010 special vacancy election for Honolulu mayor
would have been changed. 
8.  In an election challenge pursuant HRS § 11-173.5, 
the supreme court is authorized to “decide what candidate was
nominated or elected.”  HRS § 11-173.5(b).69.  The remedy provided by HRS § 11-173.5(b) of having
the court decide which candidate was nominated or elected is the
only remedy that can be given for election irregularities
challenged pursuant to HRS § 11-173.5.  Funakoshi v. King, 65
Haw. at 316, 651 P.2d at 914.
10.  A recount of votes or a new election for Honolulu
mayor is not a remedy authorized by HRS § 11-173.5(b).
11.  There is no genuine issue of material fact related
to plaintiff DeJean’s election contest.
JUDGMENT
Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and
conclusions of law, judgment is entered in favor of defendant
Bernice Mau, Clerk for the City and County of Honolulu.  Peter
Carlisle was elected mayor of the City and County of Honolulu in
the September 18, 2010 special vacancy election.  
The clerk of the supreme court shall forthwith serve a
certified copy of this judgment on the clerk of the City and
County of Honolulu in accordance with HRS § 11-173.5(b).
